    "story": [
      "With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, G\u00e9rard Depardieu reigned over cinema for half a century",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- June Carter, Kenny Chesney and Tony Brown have been invited to join the Country Music Hall of Fame.",
      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",
      "\u201dI had a really big dream and I\u2019m still pushing that dream as far as I can,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cI just wanted to record and write songs that reflected the lives of a lot of people that came to our shows.\"",
      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",
      "Every year, the Country Music Hall of Fame chooses just three inductees, one of which rotates between songwriters, recording/touring musicians and non-performers.",
      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",
      "\u201cYou make records and you make some money, but this is better than money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is about making an impact.\u201d",

      "The redacted footage shows deputies talking with the two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the home.

      "Authorities soon determined there were no leaks that could have been fatal, further fueling a mystery that captured the public\u2019s attention.",

      "The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",

      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \u201cdisappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \u201c'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\u201d",
      "They said there was an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \u201cmade no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\u201d",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

Authorities chose to try the cases jointly in Santa Barbara County, where a judge at a 2022 preliminary hearing found that there was insufficient evidence for Guillod to go to trial on charges involving four of the women.",
      "The judge found there was enough evidence to go forward with charges that he had assaulted an actor in 2012 and a waitress in 2018, but because those were both in LA County, Santa Barbara prosecutors no longer had jurisdiction and sent the cases to the Los Angeles District Attorney.",

      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",
      "Dicko is also blind. Using a special typewriter, he can create texts in braille for his students. But he says his students are still at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cWe have a crisis of teaching materials,\u201d Dicko said. He has one reading book in braille for his entire class of dozens of students.",
      "But with the development of new technologies, some blind and partially sighted people hope that educational barriers will continue to fall.",
      "\u201cThere is software, there are telephones that speak, so there are many things that are vocal,\u201d said Bagayoko of the musical duo. \u201cThis allows us to move forward.\u201d",
      "But Moussa Mbengue, the Senegal-based program officer for inclusive education at Sightsavers, said such advances still don't make the leap that braille did two centuries ago.",
      "\"It cannot replace braille. On the contrary, for me, technology complements braille,\u201d he said.",

      "Decades of road salt use is taking a toll on New York City\u2019s water reservoirs",
      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

      "A common blood test may miss ovarian cancer in some Black and Native American patients, delaying their treatment, a new study finds. It's the latest example of medical tests that contribute to health care disparities.",
      "Researchers have been working to uncover these kinds of biases in medicine.

      "The new study, supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute and published Thursday in JAMA Network Open, looked at a test called CA-125. The test measures a tumor marker in the blood, and doctors use it to determine if a woman with a suspicious lump should be referred to a cancer specialist.",
      "Doctors depend on the test during early evaluations, so understanding what the results mean for people of different races and ethnicities is critical, said Dr. Shannon Westin of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cThis is a perfect example of work that absolutely needed to be stratified based on race and ethnicity,\" Westin said. The findings alert doctors that they shouldn't be totally reassured by a normal test result, she said.",
      "So far, it\u2019s unknown why the test doesn't perform uniformly across groups. The researchers suspect it has something to do with a harmless genetic variation that is more common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian descent.",
      "Initial studies of the test, published in the 1980s, didn\u2019t record people\u2019s races but were in mostly white populations.",
      "The test isn't perfect for white women either, said lead author Dr. Anna Jo Smith of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school.",
      "\u201cBut if we have worse performance in certain groups, then we may be further contributing to disparities in referral, disparities in treatment, and ultimately we may be contributing to the lower survival in Black women with ovarian cancer,\" Smith said.",
      "The researchers analyzed data from more than 200,000 women with ovarian cancer from 2004 through 2020 who'd had a CA-125 blood test.",
      "Black and Native American patients were 23% less likely to have an elevated CA-125 level at ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with white patients, suggesting the current thresholds are set too high.",
      "The researchers also found that patients with false negative results started chemotherapy on average nine days later than patients with elevated levels. That could make a difference for some patients, Smith said.",
      "Last week, Smith and her colleagues presented work at a Society of Gynecologic Oncology meeting proposing a new lower threshold for the blood test that would work better across all populations. The work could lead to changes in guidelines.",

    "story": [
      "With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations",
      "WASHINGTON -- With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is eliminating or reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations, which meteorologists and former agency leaders said will degrade the accuracy of forecasts just as severe weather season kicks in.",
      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",
      "The balloons soar 100,000 feet in the air with sensors called radiosondes hanging about 20 feet below them that measure temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.",
      "\u201cThe thing about weather balloons is that they give you information you can't get any other way,\u201d said D. James Baker, a former NOAA chief during the Clinton administration. He had to cut spending in the agency during his tenure but he said he refused to cut observations such as weather balloons. \u201cIt's an absolutely essential piece of the forecasting system.\u201d",
      "University of Oklahoma environment professor Renee McPherson said, \u201cThis frankly is just dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBad,\u201d Ryan Maue, who was NOAA's chief scientist at the end of President Donald Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \u201cWe should not degrade our weather system by skipping balloon launches. Not only is this embarrassing for NOAA, the cessation of weather balloon launches will worsen America's weather forecasts.\u201d",
      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Officials in the South Korean city of Andong on Tuesday alerted residents to evacuate to safe areas as firefighters struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged southern regions since last week, forcing thousands to flee and destroying likely hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.",
      "Thousands of firefighters in South Korea were battling at least nine wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land in the past five days.",
      "Officials in Andong, a city in the country\u2019s southeast, and the nearby town of Uiseong ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters \u2014 including schools and indoor gyms \u2014 as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread due to strong winds. The fire in Andong was also reaching the village of Pungcheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded around the 14-15th centuries.",
      "The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple\u2019s national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.",
      "The fire was also spreading to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong.",
      "More than 3,700 firefighters, along with 76 helicopters and 530 vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires in the Uiseong and Andong areas, which were nearly 70% contained as of Tuesday evening, according to the Korea Forest Service.",
      "The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest \u201cserious\u201d level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.",
      "South Korean officials said earlier on Tuesday that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in the country\u2019s southern regions, including Uiseong, the neighboring town of Sancheong, and Ulsan city. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks.",
      "Four firefighters and government workers were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds. At least 11 other people have been injured by wildfires around the country since last Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.",
      "The national government designated the hardest-hit southeastern regions as disaster zones to focus resources and accelerate recovery efforts.",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country\u2019s acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. He also urged public vigilance as dry spring weather persists.",
      "Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.",

      "A judge on Tuesday chastised the duo \u2014 both military personnel \u2014 for being the \u201cantithesis\u201d of everything Paddington\u2019s character stands for.",
      "Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22 and engineers in the Royal Air Force, admitted in Reading Magistrates\u2019 Court that they were responsible for the March 2 vandalism in Newbury, the hometown of Paddington creator Michael Bond.",
      "\u201cPaddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike,\u201d Judge Sam Goozee said. \u201cHe represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society. ... Your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for.\u201d",
      "The statue of the bear in his signature blue coat and red hat was one of 23 installed last fall as part of a Paddington trail across England to mark the release of \u201cPaddington in Peru.\u201d The introspective bear is gazing skyward while clutching a sandwich \u2014 with marmalade about to drip on his lap.",
      "The judge noted that the label on Paddington\u2019s coat says, \u201cPlease look after this bear.\u201d",
      "Prosecutor said Jamie Renuka said the men were drunk during the escapade that was captured by a surveillance camera on the empty street just before 2 a.m. The two spirited away half of the statue in a taxi and returned to RAF Odiham base where the purloined Paddington was later found in Lawrence\u2019s car.",
      "Goozee said the crime could \u201conly be described as an act of wanton vandalism\u201d and that the two had failed to uphold the respect and integrity expected in the military.",
      "The pair, who admitted criminal damage, were ordered to perform community work and each to pay 2,725 pounds ($3,527) for repairs to the damaged statue.",
      "An RAF spokesperson said the service would consider the court's findings but that any discipline would not be disclosed because it would be a private matter.",
      "The statue is currently being repaired and will be reinstalled, the Newbury Business Improvement District said.",

      "Lai has in recent weeks repeatedly warned of China using spies and propaganda, especially internet influencers, as well as military intimidation.",
      "Earlier in the day, Liu protested outside Taiwan government offices, while trying to speak to an immigration officer. She was unsuccessful. About 50 people protested her presence while chanting: \u201cHave a good trip home,\u201d and \u201cGet yourself back to China.\u201d Police were present but no violence broke out.",
      "The vast majority of Taiwanese reject China\u2019s demands and favor the current state of de-facto independence, despite China\u2019s threats.",
      "Liu, who is married to a Taiwanese man and has three children, appeared to board the plane alone. The couple haven't revealed their future plans. Under the regulations, she will have to wait five years to reapply for a Taiwan residency permit.",
      "At least two other Chinese women with Taiwanese husbands are currently under investigation as the island moves to reinstate military trials and crack down on the recruitment of serving members of the Taiwan's military as spies.",

      "Such a conflict could draw in the U.S., which is required under American law to respond to Chinese actions against the island. The two foes are divided by the 180-kilometer (110-mile)-wide Taiwan Strait.",

      "He recognized that the woman may have felt \u201csuffocated\u201d by his behavior, which he described as a \"type of aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut certainly not sexual. Non!\u201d he exclaimed, raising his voice.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. The verdict isn't expected immediately after the trial.",
      "After Depardieu spoke first for more than an hour, the set dresser then testified. She described the alleged assault in detail, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \"in front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I had a reflex of \u2018My God.' I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn\u2019t do it,\" she testified. \u201cHe terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.\"",
      "\u201cIt was very brief, there was no shouting,\u201d she said, adding that she'd been too \u201cpetrified\u201d to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu\u2019s hands from her.",
      "\u201cI saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that\u2019s what I felt, it's savagery,\u201d she said. \"He terrified me, and that amused him.\u201d",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor's calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "\u201cHere, he\u2019s exemplary, he doesn\u2019t move, he\u2019s quiet, he doesn\u2019t make any noise,\" she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.\"",
      "On the movie set, \u201che started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities,\u201d she said.",
      "The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.",
      "Because of Depardieu\u2019s fame and impact on the French movie industry, his trial is seen as an important test of French willingness to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.",
      "His long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he's made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac. French President Emmanuel Macron has included himself among Depardieu's many admirers, calling him a \u201cgreat actor\u201d who \"makes France proud.\u201d That was in 2023, when the star was already facing sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "In his testimony, Depardieu said work has dried up as accusations have mounted. Since 2022, he's not had a big-screen lead role.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s horrible what they\u2019re doing to me, calling me a \u2018big pig\u2019! I haven\u2019t worked for three years,\u201d he said.",
      "He also has health issues. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he\u2019s fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don\u2019t exceed six hours, with regular breaks.",
      "The trial represents another reckoning for France and its attitudes to sexual violence, coming in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. She became a feminist icon when she bravely demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for horrific abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would make shame change sides.",
      "Depardieu said he apologized to the set dresser three days after the alleged assault. He said he recognized that she was in \u201cshock\u201d and \u201cpetrified.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this is not what I wanted,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged to the court that his behavior can be boorish.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been told I have a Russian nature, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the drinking or the vulgarity,\u201d he said. \u201cI have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.\"",
      "But he said he \u201cnever, ever\u201d would have pincered a woman between his legs against her will.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not like that,\" he said.",

      "A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices will gather to determine whether former President Jair Bolsonaro and several of his associates will stand trial on five counts including attempting to stage a coup",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices will gather on Tuesday to determine whether former President Jair Bolsonaro and close allies will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet charged Bolsonaro last month with plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his opponent and current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Part of that plan allegedly included poisoning Lula and killing Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of Bolsonaro.",
      "Five Supreme Court justices \u2014 including de Moraes, the rapporteur \u2014 will meet from 9:30 a.m. local time in Brasilia to rule on the charges leveled by Gonet. If a majority votes in favor, the accused will become defendants in a criminal case.",
      "Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices also stand accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and a serious threat against the state\u2019s assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.",
      "Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says that he's being politically persecuted.",
      "Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but combined with the other charges, he could be sentenced to decades behind bars.",
      "Observers say that it's likely that the charges will be accepted.",
      "\u201cThere is no shadow of a doubt that there are very clear elements\u201d that crimes were committed, said Thiago Bottino, a law professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university. \u201cThe current tendency is that there will be a criminal trial.\u201d",
      "Gonet filed charges against a total of 34 people in February. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will analyze whether to accept charges against eight of them. As well as Bolsonaro, the court will vote on the accusations faced by former Defense Ministers Walter Braga Netto and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira and ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres, among others. The court will decide on the others' fates later on.",
      "Bolsonaro has sought to shore up political support before the possible trial, including by holding a protest on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on March 16.",
      "Local media reported that around 18,000 people attended the rally, based on figures from a monitoring project linked to the University of Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro\u2019s allies had hoped to draw a crowd of 1 million, which led some analysts to say that his ability to mobilize voters is diminishing.",
      "Bolsonaro called on social media Sunday for a new demonstration on April 6, to be held on one of Sao Paulo\u2019s main arteries, Avenida Paulista.",
      "As with the protest earlier this month, the former president and his allies will push for Congress to grant amnesty to those in jail for their roles in the Jan. 8, 2023 riot, when Bolsonaro\u2019s die-hard fans stormed and trashed the Supreme Court, Presidential Palace and Congress a week after Lula took office.",
      "In his indictment of Bolsonaro and others linked to him, Gonet said that the rampage was a last-ditch attempt to hold onto power.",
      "Bolsonaro, a former military officer who was known to express nostalgia for the country\u2019s 1964-1985 dictatorship, openly defied Brazil\u2019s judicial system during his 2019-2022 term in office.",
      "He has already been banned by Brazil\u2019s top electoral court from running in elections until 2030 over abuse of power while in office and casting unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis\u2019 medical team briefly considered suspending treatment after a Feb. 28 breathing crisis but instead decided on an aggressive course that put his organs at risk, the doctor coordinating the pope\u2019s hospital care said in an interview published Tuesday.",

      "\"We needed to choose whether to stop and let him go, or to push it and attempt with all of the possible drugs and the treatments, taking the very high risk of damaging other organs,\u2019\u2019 Alfieri told told the Milan daily Corriere della Sera. \u201cIn the end, that is the path we chose.\u201d",
      "Francis was released Sunday after 38 days of treatment for double pneumonia, under doctors' orders to observe two months of convalescence during which he should avoid large gatherings. The pope appeared weak and frail when he greeted the crowd outside the Gemelli hospital before his discharge.",
      "The Vatican has said it is not clear if the pope will meet with King Charles III on a Vatican state visit next month, or any Holy Week activities leading up to Easter on April 20.",
      "Alfieri said that the pope remained \u201calert\u2019\u2019 throughout the Feb. 28 ordeal and that his personal health care assistant, Massimiliano Strappetti, \u201cwho knows perfectly the pontiff\u2019s wishes,\u2019\u2019 urged them \u201cto try everything. Don\u2019t give up.\u201d",
      "Alfieri acknowledged that the treatment risked damaging the pope\u2019s kidneys and bone marrow, \u201cbut we continued, and his body responded to the treatments and the lung infection improved.\u2019\u2019",
      "The medical bulletin that night said that the pope had suffered a bronchiospasm so severe that he inhaled vomit \u201cworsening his respiratory picture.\u201d Doctors used a non-invasive aspiration to clear his airways.",
      "Three days later, in a second life-and-death crisis, the pope suffered a pair of acute bronchiospasms episodes. Doctors used a camera tube with a device to remove mucus plus that yielded abundant secretions. The bulletin emphasized that the pope \u201calways remained alert, oriented and collaborative.\u2019\u2019",
      "Alfieri said he believed that prayers for the pope help keep him alive, something that the doctor said is backed by scientific literature.",
      "\u201cIn this case the whole world was praying. I can say that twice the situation was lost, and then it happened like a miracle,\u2019\u2019 the doctor said, adding that \u201cof course he was a very cooperative patient.\u2019\u2019",

      "South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulate...",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s truth commission has concluded that the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "The landmark report released Wednesday followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States, and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea\u2019s foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and \u201980s.",
      "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a government-appointed fact-finding panel, said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May.",
      "However, some adoptees and even a senior investigator on the commission criticized the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government\u2019s complicity.",
      "That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, a standing commissioner, also lamented the panel\u2019s decision-making committee\u2019s 5-4 vote on Tuesday to defer assessments of 42 other adoptees\u2019 cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission\u2019s conservative chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions.",
      "However, Lee implied that some committee members were reluctant to recognize cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified \u2014 either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them.",
      "Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives.",
      "Lee said the commission\u2019s stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases.",
      "\u201cPersonally, I find yesterday\u2019s decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,\u201d Lee said.",
      "After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children, including those born to poor parents or unwed mothers.",
      "Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea\u2019s military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their possession and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in \"large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,\u201d the commission said.",
      "Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children\u2019s identities, according to the commission\u2019s report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies.",
      "The commission recommended the South Korean government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States \u2014 the largest recipient of Korean children by far \u2014 and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions, which have drawn growing international attention amid criticism that thousands of children were carelessly or unnecessarily separated from their biological families. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, the government department that handles adoption issues, didn\u2019t immediately comment on the commission\u2019s report.",
      "Around 200,000 South Koreans were adopted to Western countries in the past seven decades, forming what\u2019s believed to be the world\u2019s largest diaspora of adoptees.",
      "Most were placed with white parents in the United States and Europe during the 1970-80s. South Korea's then military leaders focused on economic growth and saw adoptions as a tool to reduce welfare burdens, erase the \u201csocial problem\u201d of unwed mothers and deepen ties with the democratic West.",
      "The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to the heads of private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year.",
      "Recent reforms, including a 2011 law that reinstated judicial oversight by requiring foreign adoptions to go through family courts, have led to a significant decline in the overseas placements of South Korean children, with only 79 cases in 2023.",

      "In a 12-page report, Human Rights Watch accused the rebels of executing unarmed farmers and forcibly recruiting dozens of children into their ranks. The group also called on Colombia\u2019s government to speed up investigations into homicides in Catatumbo, where at least 78 people were killed in January and February, after a truce ended between rebel groups in the area.",
      "\u201cOur research points to widespread abuses against ordinary people,\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, Americas director for HRW.",
      "According to the Colombian Human Rights Ombudsman\u2019s Office, more than 56,000 people have been displaced from their homes in the Catatumbo region since Jan. 16, when the National Liberation Army, or ELN, launched a violent campaign to strengthen its grip on the area.",
      "Human Rights Watch said that in some villages, the rebels dragged people out of their homes and shot those who they accused of being collaborators of a rival group known as the FARC-EMC.",
      "Human Rights Watch interviewed 65 people for its investigation, including judicial officials, aid workers and displaced farmers.",
      "\u201cIt seems that the ELN is trying to control the border with Venezuela, partly due to the drug trade,\u201d said Juan Pappier, Human Rights Watch deputy director for the Americas. \u201cAnd for that they\u2019ve long benefited from the complicity of Venezuelan security forces.\u201d",
      "Some people who fled the Catatumbo region told Human Rights Watch that the ELN executed farmers in front of their families.",
      "Others accused the FARC-EMC group of running forced labor camps, where local people who were accused of committing crimes were forced to cut sugar cane for more than 12 hours a day.",

      "NUUK, Greenland -- Lisa S\u00f3lrun Christiansen gets up at 4 a.m. most days and gets to work knitting thick wool sweaters coveted by buyers around the world for their warmth and colorful patterns celebrating Greenland\u2019s traditional Inuit culture.",
      "Her morning routine includes a quick check of the news, but these days the ritual shatters her peace because of all the stories about U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s designs on her homeland.",
      "\u201cI get overwhelmed,\u2019\u2019 Christiansen said earlier this month as she looked out to sea, where impossibly blue icebergs floated just offshore.",
      "The daughter of Inuit and Danish parents, Christiansen, 57, cherishes Greenland. It is a source of immense family pride that her father, an artist and teacher, designed the red-and-white Greenlandic flag.",
      "\u201cOn his deathbed he talked a lot about the flag, and he said that the flag is not his, it\u2019s the people\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s one sentence I keep thinking about. He said, \u2018I hope the flag will unite the Greenlandic people.\u2019\u2019\u2019",
      "Greenlanders are increasingly worried that their homeland, a self-governing region of Denmark, has become a pawn in the competition between the U.S., Russia and China as global warming opens up access to the Arctic. They fear Trump\u2019s aim to take control of Greenland, which holds rich mineral deposits and straddles strategic air and sea routes, may block their path toward independence.",
      "Those fears were heightened Sunday when Usha Vance, the wife of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, announced she would visit Greenland later this week to attend the national dogsled race. Separately, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will visit a U.S. military base in northern Greenland.",
      "The announcement inflamed tensions sparked earlier this month when Trump reiterated his desire to annex Greenland just two days after Greenlanders elected a new parliament opposed to becoming part of the U.S. Trump even made a veiled reference to the possibility of military pressure, noting the U.S. bases in Greenland and musing that \u201cmaybe you\u2019ll see more and more soldiers go there.\u201d",
      "News of the visit drew an immediate backlash from local politicians, who described it as a display of U.S. power at a time they are trying to form a government.",
      "\"It must also be stated in bold that our integrity and democracy must be respected without any external interference,'' outgoing Prime Minister M\u00fate Boroup Egede said.",
      "Greenland, part of Denmark since 1721, has been moving toward independence for decades. It\u2019s a goal most Greenlanders support, though they differ on when and how that should happen. They don\u2019t want to trade Denmark for an American overlord.",
      "The question is whether Greenland will be allowed to control its own destiny at a time of rising international tensions when Trump sees the island as key to U.S. national security.",
      "While Greenland has limited leverage against the world\u2019s greatest superpower, Trump made a strategic mistake by triggering a dispute with Greenland and Denmark rather than working with its NATO allies in Nuuk and Copenhagen, said Otto Svendsen, an Arctic expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.",
      "Trump\u2019s actions, he says, have united Greenlanders and fostered a greater sense of national identity.",
      "\u201cYou have this feeling of pride and of self-determination in Greenland that the Greenlanders are not, you know, cowed by this pressure coming from Washington,\u201d Svendsen said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re doing everything in their power to make their voices heard.\u201d",
      "Denmark recognized Greenland\u2019s right to independence at a time of its choosing under the 2009 Greenland Self-Government Act, which was approved by local voters and ratified by the Danish parliament. The right to self-determination is also enshrined in the United Nations charter, approved by the U.S. in 1945.",
      "But Trump is more focused on the economic and security needs of the U.S. than the rights of smaller nations. Since returning to office in January, he has pressured Ukraine into giving the U.S. access to valuable mineral resources, threatened to reclaim the Panama Canal and suggested that Canada should become the 51st state.",
      "Now he has turned his attention to Greenland, a territory of 56,000 people, most from indigenous Inuit backgrounds.",
      "Greenland guards access to the Arctic at a time when melting sea ice has reignited competition for energy and mineral resources and attracted an increased Russian military presence. The Pituffik Space Base on the island\u2019s northwest coast supports missile warning and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.",
      "Before Trump\u2019s re-election, Greenlanders hoped to leverage this unique position to help the country achieve independence. Now they fear it has made them vulnerable.",
      "Cebastian Rosing, who works for a water taxi firm that offers tours around the Nuuk fjord, said he\u2019s frustrated that Trump is trying to take over just as Greenland has begun to assert its autonomy and celebrate its Inuit origins.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so weird to defend (the idea) that our country is our country because it\u2019s always been our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting our culture back because of colonialism.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not that Greenlanders don\u2019t like the U.S. They have welcomed Americans for decades.",
      "The U.S. effectively occupied Greenland during World War II, building a string of air and naval bases.",
      "After the war, President Harry Truman\u2019s government offered to buy the island because of \u201cthe extreme importance of Greenland to the defense of the United States.\u201d Denmark rejected the proposal but signed a long-term base agreement.",
      "When Trump resurrected the proposal during his first term, it was quickly rejected by Denmark and dismissed as a headline-grabbing stunt. But now Trump is pursuing the idea with renewed energy.",
      "During a speech earlier this month he told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. needed to take control of Greenland to protect its national security. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOne way or the other.\u201d",
      "Even so, Trump has his admirers in Greenland.",
      "And there is no greater fan than J\u00f8rgen Boassen. When he spoke to The Associated Press, Boassen wore a T-shirt featuring a photo of Trump with his fist in the air and blood streaming down his face after an assassination attempt last year. Underneath was the slogan, \u201cAmerican Badass.\u201d",
      "Boassen works for an organization called American Daybreak, which was founded by former Trump official Thomas Dans and promotes closer ties between the U.S. and Greenland.",
      "The former bricklayer, who describes himself as \u201c110%\u2033 Inuit, has a litany of complaints about Denmark, most stemming from what he sees as mistreatment of local people during colonial rule. In particular, he cites Inuit women who say they were fitted with birth control devices without their permission during the 1970s.",
      "Trump must act to secure America\u2019s back door, Boassen says, because Denmark has failed to guarantee Greenland\u2019s security.",
      "But even he wants Greenland to be independent, a U.S. ally but not the 51st state.",
      "What he has in mind is something more like the free-association agreement the Marshall Islands negotiated with the U.S. when it became independent in 1986. That agreement recognizes the Pacific archipelago as a sovereign nation that conducts its own foreign policy but gives the U.S. control over defense and security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in 2025,\u2019\u2019 Boassen said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t believe they can come here and take over.\u201d",
      "Whatever happens, most Greenlanders agree that the island's fate should be up to them, not Trump.",
      "\u201cWe have to stand together,\u2019\u2019 Christiansen said, her knitting needles clicking and clacking.",

First, she said, she was dragged to a military encampment and gang-raped by Eritrean soldiers who held dozens of other women. Two days later, she was raped again by a group of militiamen.",
      "Her attackers broke her collarbone and her wrist. They also infected her with HIV. More than two years later, she can sometimes buy antiretroviral drugs by selling part of the wheat she gets as a displaced person, but it's not enough.",
      "\u201cI am strong, but my disease is getting worse and worse,\u201d the woman told The Associated Press at a clinic in Shire, a town in northwestern Tigray. The AP typically does not identify people who are victims of sexual abuse.",
      "Tigray was once considered a model in the fight against HIV. Years of awareness-raising efforts had brought the region's HIV prevalence rate to 1.4%, one of the lowest in Ethiopia.",
      "Then, in 2020, war began between Ethiopia's government, backed by neighboring Eritrea, and Tigray fighters.",
      "Sexual violence was widespread in the two-year conflict, which also had mass killings, hunger and disease. As many as 10% of women and girls aged between 15 and 49 in the region of 6 million people were subject to sexual abuse, mostly rape and gang rape, according to a study published by BMJ Global Health in 2023.",
      "At the same time, Tigray\u2019s health system was systematically looted and destroyed, leaving only 17% of health centers functional, according to another study in the same journal.",
      "As a result, 90% of sexual violence survivors did not get timely medical support.",
      "The woman told the AP she did not get medication for nearly eight months. The window for receiving prophylaxis to prevent HIV is 72 hours.",
      "Today the HIV prevalence rate in Tigray is 3%, more than double the prewar average, according to local health authorities and the United Nations. The rate among the region\u2019s roughly 1 million displaced people is 5.5%.",
      "Among sexual violence survivors, it is 8.6%.",
      "\u201cIt was a horrific conflict,\u201d said Amanuel Haile, the head of Tigray\u2019s health bureau. \u201cWar was everywhere. Crops failed. Rape was widespread. Hospitals were vandalized. Drugs were interrupted.\u201d",
      "The \u201ccomplete breakdown\u201d of Tigray\u2019s health services also meant existing HIV patients did not receive antiretrovirals during the war, increasing their risk of transmitting the virus through pregnancy or unprotected sex, Amanuel said.",
      "Few condoms were available during the war, which saw Tigray cut off from the rest of Ethiopia. Today, some destitute displaced people engage in sex work to survive, another factor that health workers believe is contributing to the spike in HIV cases.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s decision to kill 83% of U.S. Agency for International Development programs globally is worsening the situation.",
      "Ethiopia has already laid off 5,000 health workers who were hired with U.S. funds to combat HIV. Meanwhile, charities helping HIV patients receive treatment have received stop-work orders.",
      "They include the Organization for Social Services, Health and Development, a national agency whose Tigray branch was testing people for HIV and giving HIV patients food and financial support.",
      "\u201cSince the end of the war, things were slowly improving,\u201d said Yirga Gebregziabher, OSSHD\u2019s manager in Tigray. \u201cNow so many services have stopped again.\u201d",
      "Like the rest of Ethiopia, Tigray is also grappling with sharp rises in other infectious diseases because of the effects of conflict, climate change and funding cuts.",
      "Nationally, malaria cases have soared from 900,000 in 2019 to over 10 million last year. The war interrupted efforts to distribute nets and spray high-risk areas with insecticides to prevent the mosquito-borne disease. Measles rose from 1,941 cases in 2021 to 28,129 in 2024. Cholera and tuberculosis are also making comebacks.",
      "Health workers say Tigray is particularly ill-equipped to deal with these outbreaks. It has few ambulances after most of its emergency vehicles were destroyed in the war. Some doctors have not been paid for 17 months. And its biggest health facility, Ayder Referral Hospital, only has 50% of the drugs it needs.",
      "\u201cThese outbreaks are extremely damaging,\u201d said Amanuel with the regional health bureau. \u201cWe have a lot to rebuild, and outbreaks take up whatever meager resources we have.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile millions in Tigray still rely on humanitarian aid and 18% of children are malnourished, leaving them vulnerable to diseases.",
      "\u201cWe are attempting to rebuild, but still in a state of crisis,\u201d said Abraha Gebreegziabher, the clinical director of Ayder Referral Hospital.",
      "Abraha\u2019s institution is grappling with severe budget cuts and debts that mean it cannot afford basic drugs or items like tubes and syringes. The hospital requires patients to pay for services that were previously free.",
      "Crucially, the war also destroyed Tigray\u2019s system of community-based health insurance, a low-cost program that underpinned the region\u2019s health system.",
      "Restarting this scheme is the health bureau\u2019s top priority, Amanuel said.",

      "A network of survivors of Catholic clergy sex abuse has announced a database of cardinals' records on how they have handled such cases in a bid to influence the next papal conclave",
      "ROME -- A network of clergy sex abuse survivors on Tuesday announced a database of Catholic cardinals\u2019 records on the handling of such cases in a bid to influence the next papal conclave, while urging Pope Francis in a letter to adopt a worldwide zero-tolerance policy following the U.S. church example.",
      "The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests unveiled \u201cConclave Watch,\u2019\u2019 a database on cardinals\u2019 records on clergy sex abuse that it hopes will put the issue at the center of consideration whenever the next pope is chosen.",
      "SNAP board members arrived in Rome three weeks ago as Pope Francis was hospitalized in life-threatening condition, with the prospect of a conclave seemingly near. He returned to the Vatican on Sunday after beating double pneumonia, with doctor\u2019s orders to take it easy for the next two months \u2014 putting to rest at least for now notions of a papal resignation or a funeral that would trigger the process to choose a successor.",
      "\u201cMany people have asked me \u2026 \u2018Why now? The pope is sick. Now is not the time,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Shawn Dougherty, SNAP Board president and a survivor from Pennsylvania, told a news conference. \u201cAnd we determined if not now, when, and if not us, who?\u2019\u2019",
      "The database was set to go live soon, starting with six cardinals, five of whom were chosen for their decision-making roles in the Roman Catholic church on the handling of clergy abuse cases. More will be added.",
      "The initiative vets cardinals who are considered contenders for the papacy on their records handling sexual abuse cases, including whether they were involved in covering up cases, as well as their acceptance of a zero-tolerance law that SNAP wants Francis to adopt.",
      "SNAP also released a letter to Francis urging him to adopt its zero-tolerance law, drafted with canon and civil lawyers as well as human rights experts that would remove known offender priests from ministries and hold bishops accountable in cases of coverups.",
      "To date, the only place where there are norms for removing known sexual offenders from the priesthood is the United States, said Peter Isley, of the network\u2019s global policy working group. \u201cThe United States is just 6% of the Catholic world. So 94% doesn\u2019t have that,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "The group hopes the letter will be delivered to Francis by Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean victim of abuse appointed by the pope as an international advocate for survivors, by the end of the week.",
      "SNAP underlined the importance of pushing the issue as the pope continues his physical recovery, in light of his announcement in February that he would produce an apostolic exhortation dedicated to children aimed at educating them about their rights. They hope that their definition of zero-tolerance could be truly enshrined.",
      "\u201cWe wish him a full recovery because we have work to do together,\u2019\u2019 Isley said.",

      "Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea\u2019s worst ever were ravaging the country\u2019s southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever were ravaging the country's southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.",
      "Officials also said a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain wildfires in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest-hit by the wildfires. The Korea Forest Service said rescue efforts were underway and it was presumed that the aircraft was operated by one pilot with no crew members.",
      "An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were among the structures destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 43,330 acres and injured 19 people, the government\u2019s emergency response center said.",
      "In a televised address, South Korea\u2019s acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were causing worse damage than many other past wildfires.",
      "\u201cDamages are snowballing,\u201d Han said. \u201cThere are concerns that we\u2019ll have wildfire damages that we\u2019ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.\u201d",
      "Han said crews were struggling to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. Han said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday to extinguish the wildfires with the help of about 130 helicopters. He said that \u201ca small amount\u201d of 5-10 millimeters of rain was expected Thursday.",
      "Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea in terms of land burned.",
      "Officials in several southeastern cities and towns had ordered residents to evacuate Tuesday as firefighters struggled to contain multiple blazes fueled by dry winds. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan, according to South Korea's Interior Ministry.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, officials had said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed the blazes to spread again. But efforts to fight the fires were partially suspended overnight as the winds strengthened.",
      "The blaze in Uiseong destroyed nearly half of more than 30 structures at Gounsa, a temple which was said to be originally built in the 7th century. Among the destroyed structures were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\" \u2014 a pavilion-shaped structure built on a stream built in 1668 and a Joseon Dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",
      "The temple\u2019s another state-designated \u201ctreasure,\u201d a stone Buddha statue reportedly manufactured in the 8th century, was evacuated to a safe place, according to government and Buddhist officials.",
      "The Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility.",
      "The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest \u201cserious\u201d level nationwide Tuesday, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.",
      "The 18 dead include four firefighters and government workers who were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials.",
      "Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.",

      "In court papers filed Tuesday in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Kroger said Albertsons disregarded the companies\u2019 merger agreement and worked secretly with a partner, C&S Wholesalers, to try to force Kroger to divest more stores to C&S.",
      "Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn\u2019t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Albertsons said it was Kroger that failed to honor the merger agreement.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s self-interested conduct doomed the merger, and we are now focused on returning value to Albertsons\u2019 shareholders to compensate for those losses,\u201d Albertsons said.",
      "Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart and Costco.",
      "But the Federal Trade Commission and two states \u2014 Washington and Colorado \u2014 sued to block the merger last year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers\u2019 wages by eliminating competition. It also said Kroger and Albertsons' plan to divest 579 stores C&S Wholesalers was inadequate to ensure competition, since C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.",
      "In December, judges in Washington and Oregon halted the merger in two rulings issued within hours of each other.",
      "Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.",
      "But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",

      "Delaware lawmakers are putting aside protests from big investors and approving fast-tracked legislation that backers say will protect its status as the world's corporate capital",
      "Delaware lawmakers put aside protests from major investors and approved fast-tracked legislation Tuesday night that backers say will protect its status as the corporate capital of the world after criticism by billionaire Elon Musk and other influential business titans rattled public officials.",
      "The bill is headed to Gov. Matt Meyer, a Democrat who met with corporate leaders about their concerns about precedent-setting court decisions governing corporate conflicts of interest and urged lawmakers to quickly pass changes to the law.",
      "They did, sending the bill through both chambers within two weeks of its introduction, despite shareholders\u2019 lawyers, consumer groups and pension funds slamming it as a giveaway to billionaires and corporate insiders. The House approved it Tuesday night, 32-7, after a unanimous Senate earlier in March.",
      "Delaware\u2019s experienced corporate law courts and their well-developed body of corporate case law have become the go-to destination to settle all sorts of business disputes as the legal home of more than 2 million corporate entities, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies.",
      "The state also reaps billions of dollars from the activity, making lawmakers nervous that corporations could flee Delaware and undercut a major source of revenue that funds one-third of Delaware's operating budget.",
      "After two hours of debate Tuesday, Rep. Krista Griffith told colleagues that the bill was complex, but the reasons for voting for it were simple: \u201cProtect Delaware\u2019s economy, protect future opportunities for the people in our state. We have the best business court in the nation.\u201d",
      "However, an opponent, Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton \u2014 referring to the business courts as Delaware's \u201cgolden goose\u201d \u2014 warned that the changes being passed could end up \"cooking that golden goose.\u201d",
      "A legal challenge is widely expected after Meyer signs the bill.",
      "In hearings, lawmakers were warned by corporate lawyers and state officials that businesses were contemplating moving their legal home \u2014 a \u201cDexit,\u201d as it has been dubbed \u2014 and that startups are being advised to incorporate elsewhere, such as competitors Nevada or Texas.",
      "Corporate leaders complained about a lack of predictability, clarity and fairness, lawmakers were told.",
      "Last year, Musk slammed Delaware, saying \u201cNever incorporate your company in the state of Delaware\u201d and instead recommended Nevada or Texas as destinations after a Delaware judge invalidated his landmark compensation package from Tesla worth potentially more than $55 billion.",
      "Musk and Tesla are appealing in the state Supreme Court, and Musk\u2019s companies \u2014 Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink \u2014 all departed Delaware for Nevada or Texas.",
      "The fallout seemed to accelerate in recent weeks when the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta Platforms \u2014 the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 was considering moving its incorporation to Texas. Meta \u2014 run by billionaire chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 didn\u2019t confirm the report.",
      "The bill has come under withering criticism that it will tilt the playing field decisively against investors, including pensioners and middle-class savers, and make it harder for them to hold billionaires and corporate insiders accountable for violating their fiduciary duty.",
      "In a statement, the Consumer Federation of America said Delaware's lawmakers \u201cclearly failed to protect investors with the passage of the Billionaire\u2019s Bill.\u201d",
      "Opponents argue that the bill overturns decades of court precedents. But its backers say it is only affecting newer precedents, modernizing the law, clarifying gray areas and maintaining balance between corporate officers and shareholders.",
      "The bill changes several provisions.",
      "One, it gives corporate officers and controlling stockholders more protections in certain conflict-of-interest cases in state courts when fighting shareholder lawsuits.",
      "Two, it limits the kind of documents that a company must produce in court cases and makes it harder for stockholders to get access to internal documents or communication that could prove time-consuming and expensive for a company to produce \u2014 not to mention, damaging to its case.",
      "Institutional investors warn that such a law may prompt them to push corporations that they own to incorporate elsewhere.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s crypto empire is expanding with the recent announcements of a new dollar-backed stablecoin and investment funds for digital assets. The moves are the latest in the norm-defying ways the president has leaned into crypto projects that could significantly boost his personal wealth while in office.",
      "World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture Trump helped launch last year, announced Tuesday that it plans to launch USD1, a stablecoin pegged at a 1-to-1 ratio to the U.S. dollar.",
      "Stablecoins are among the fastest growing segments of the cryptocurrency industry. They are typically backed by a government-issued currency, like the dollar, or to gold, making them better suited to commercial transactions than more volatile digital assets like bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re offering a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can confidently integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions,\u201d Zach Witkoff, a World Liberty Financial co-founder, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "World Liberty\u2019s announcement comes amid a push by Congress, with strong support by the White House, to pass legislation that supporters say would make it easier for stablecoin companies to operate and grow in the U.S.",
      "Witkoff and his father, Trump\u2019s special diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff, helped launch World Liberty Financial with Trump and his sons last year. Under the terms outlined on the company\u2019s website, a Trump-owned company has the \u201cright to receive 75% of the net protocol revenues\u201d from World Liberty Financial after expenses.",
      "On Monday, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. announced it was partnering with the crypto-trading firm Crypto.com to launch exchange-traded funds for investors to purchase. The funds, which are set to be released later this year, will include a \u201cunique ETF basket of cryptocurrencies\u201d as well as \u201csecurities with a Made in America focus spanning diverse industries such as energy,\u201d TMTG said in an announcement.",
      "TMTG is the parent company of Trump\u2019s social media company, Truth Social. Trump has no decision-making role at the company, but he owns a majority stake and is its largest shareholder. TMTG\u2019s stock price jumped following the announcement.",
      "The recent announcements add to a growing list of crypto-related projects that Trump has endorsed in ways that critics say are inappropriate for a public office holder.",
      "Just days before taking office, Trump launched his own meme coin that initially saw a massive price spike followed by a prolonged slide. Meme coins are highly speculative assets that often start as a joke and have no real value. Trump has also promoted online watch and sneaker stores that have branched out into selling crypto-related Trump products, including a \u201cCrypto President\u201d timepiece that sells for $100,000.",
      "Once a crypto skeptic, Trump has since embraced digital assets and pledged to make the U.S. the \u201cworld capital\u201d for cryptocurrencies. He\u2019s taken several early steps to help boost the crypto industry, which spent heavily to help Trump win last year\u2019s election and has emerged as a potent political force.",
      "Before taking office, the Trump family business released a voluntary ethics agreement that prohibits the president from \u201cday-to-day\u201d decision making of his companies and limits financial information shared with him. But that agreement doesn't bar him from promoting his crypto-related products, like he did on social media Sunday when touting his meme coin.",
      "\u201cI LOVE $TRUMP \u2014 SO COOL!!! The Greatest of them all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social, which briefly caused a spike in the meme coin\u2019s price.",

      "Since the 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, communities across Hawaii have sought ways to protect themselves from more destructive fires wrought by decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies",
      "KULA, Hawaii -- The car tires, propane tanks, gas generators and rusty appliances heaped on the side of a dirt road waiting to be hauled away filled Desiree Graham with relief.",
      "\u201cThat means all that stuff is not in people\u2019s yards,\" she said on a blustery July day in Kahikinui, a remote Native Hawaiian homestead community in southeast Maui where wildfire is a top concern.",
      "In June, neighbors and volunteers spent four weekends clearing rubbish from their properties in a community-wide effort to create \u201cdefensible space,\u201d or areas around homes free of ignitable vegetation and debris. They purged 12 tons of waste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ugly, but it\u2019s pretty beautiful to me,\u201d said Graham, a member of Kahikinui's Firewise committee, part of a rapidly growing program from the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association that helps residents assess their communities' fire risk and create plans to mitigate it.",
      "Kahikinui is one of dozens of Hawaii communities seeking ways to protect themselves as decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies culminate to cause more destructive fires.",
      "The state has 250,000 acres of unmanaged fallow agricultural land, nearly all of its buildings sit within the wildland-urban interface, and two-thirds of communities have only one road in and out.",
      "But experts say that even with so many factors out of communities\u2019 control, they can vastly improve their resilience \u2014 by transforming their own neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFire is not like other natural hazards, it can only move where there is fuel, and we have a lot of say in that,\u201d said Nani Barretto, co-executive director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization (HWMO), a 25-year-old nonprofit at the forefront of the state\u2019s fire-risk mitigation.",
      "Neighborhoods all over the United States are wrestling with the same challenge, some in places that never worried about fire before. A recent Headwaters Economics analysis found 1,100 communities in 32 states shared similar risk profiles to places recently devastated by urban wildfires.",
      "HWMO helps communities like Kahikinui become Firewise. In the 10 years preceding the August 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, 15 Hawaii communities joined Firewise USA. Since then, the number has more than doubled to 31, with a dozen more in the process of joining.",
      "\u201cEveryone was like, \u2019My God, what can we do?'\u201d said Shelly Aina, former chair of the Firewise committee for Waikoloa Village, an 8,000-resident community on the west side of the Big Island, recalling the months after the Maui fires.",
      "The development \u2014 heavily wind exposed, surrounded by dry invasive grasses and with just one main road in and out \u2014 had already experienced several close calls in the last two decades. It was first recognized as Firewise in 2016.",
      "As HWMO-trained home assessors, Shelly and her husband Dana Aina have done over 60 free assessments for neighbors since 2022, evaluating their properties for ignition vulnerabilities. Volunteers removed kiawe trees last year along a fuel break bordering houses. Residents approved an extra HOA fee for vegetation removal on interior lots.",
      "Measures like these can have outsized impact as people in fire-prone states adapt to more extreme wildfires, according to Dr. Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service scientist.",
      "\u201cThe solution is in the community, not out there with the fire breaks, because those don\u2019t stop the fire in extreme conditions,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Direct flames from a wildfire aren\u2019t what typically initiate an urban conflagration, he said. Wind-blown embers can travel miles away from a fire, landing on combustible material like dry vegetation, or accumulating in corners like where a deck meets siding.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re urban fires, not wildfires,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "The solutions don't always require expensive retrofits like a whole new roof, but targeting the specific places within 100 feet of the house where embers could ignite material. In dense neighborhoods, that requires residents work together, making community-wide efforts like Firewise important. \u201cThe house is only as ignition resistant as its neighbors,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Even with renewed interest in fire resilience, community leaders face challenges in mobilizing their neighbors. Mitigation can take money, time and sacrifice. It\u2019s not enough to cut the grass once, for example, vegetation has to be regularly maintained. Complacency sets in. Measures like removing hazardous trees can cost thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we deal with that, because those who have them can\u2019t afford to take them down,\u201d said Shelly Aina. The Ainas try offering low-cost measures, like installing metal screening behind vents and crawl spaces to keep out embers.",
      "HWMO helps with costs where it can. It gave Kahikinui a $5,000 grant for a dumpster service to haul out its waste, and helped Waikoloa Village rent a chipper for the trees it removed. It\u2019s been hard to keep up with the need, said Barretto, but even just a little bit of financial assistance can have an exponential impact.",
      "\u201cYou give them money, they rally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can give them $1,000 and it turns into 1,000 man hours of doing the clearing.\u201d HWMO was able to expand its grant program after the Maui fires with donations from organizations like the Bezos Earth Fund and the American Red Cross.",
      "At a time when federal funding for climate mitigation is uncertain, communities need far more financial support to transform their neighborhoods, said Headwaters Economics' Kimi Barrett, who studies the costs of increasing fire risk. \u201cIf what we\u2019re trying to do is save people and communities, then we must significantly invest in people and communities,\u201d said Barrett.",
      "Those investments are just a fraction of the billions of dollars in losses sustained after megafires, said Barrett. A recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Allstate found that $1 in resilience and preparation investment can save $13 in economic and property losses after a disaster.",
      "Another hurdle is asking residents to do work and make sacrifices as they watch others neglect their role. \u201cThe neighbors will ask, \u2018What about the county land?' There\u2019s no routine maintenance,\u2019\u201d said Shelly Aina.",
      "Her husband Dana Aina said he reminds people that it is everyone\u2019s kuleana, or responsibility, to take care of land and people. \u201cAn island is a canoe, a canoe is an island,\u201d he said, quoting a Hawaiian proverb. \u201cWe all have to paddle together.\u201d",
      "Bigger stakeholders are starting to make changes. Among them, Hawaii passed legislation to create a state fire marshal post, and its main utility, Hawaiian Electric, is undergrounding some power lines and installing AI-enabled cameras to detect ignitions earlier.",
      "Meanwhile, Firewise communities have found that doing their own mitigation gives them more clout when asking for funding or for others to do their part.",
      "After the 66-residence community of Kawaihae Village on Hawaii Island joined Firewise, they were finally able to get a neighboring private landowner and the state to create fuel breaks and clear grasses.",
      "\u201cWithout that we wouldn\u2019t have been on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d said Brenda DuFresne, committee member of Kawaihae Firewise. \u201cI think Firewise is a way to show people that you\u2019re willing to help yourself.\u201d",

      "European sales of Tesla electric vehicles tumbled 49% in the first two months of the year even as overall sales of EVs grew",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- European sales of Tesla electric vehicles tumbled 49% in the first two months of the year compared with a year earlier even as overall sales of EVs grew, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.",
      "There have been complaints about an aging lineup of vehicles from Tesla and also a significant backlash against CEO Elon Musk and his affiliation with the Trump administration in the U.S. In Europe, Musk's endorsement of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany party in last month's national election drew broad condemnation.",
      "Tesla faces increasing competition from major automakers as they ramp up EV production, including China's BYD. On Tuesday, BYD reported a record 777.1 billion yuan ($107 billion) in revenue for 2024 as sales of its electric and hybrid vehicles jumped 40%. Earlier this month, BYD announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says is nearly as quick as a fill up at the gas pump.",
      "Tesla sales for January and February slumped to 19,046 from 37,311 in the same period in 2024. That comes against the background of a 28.4% increase in sales of all battery-electric cars in Europe.",
      "German politicians and opinion media sharply criticized Musk over his support for the AfD, while Tesla vehicles and dealerships have been the target of protesters in the U.S. and Europe over the AfD endorsement and his role advising U.S. President Donald Trump in drastically reducing the size of the US federal government.",
      "Tesla sales are falling globally, however. The company posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years in January. Tesla's new Cybertruck has had multiple recalls including last week, when the company recalled nearly all of them because panels that run along the left and right side of the windshield can fly off when driving.",
      "It was the eighth recall of the Cybertruck since deliveries to customers began just over a year ago.",

      "BANGKOK -- Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD logged a record 777.1 billion yuan ($107 billion) in revenue last year as its sales of battery electric and hybrid vehicles jumped 40%.",

      "BYD\u2019s net profit last year was about 40 billion yuan ($5.6 billion), up 34% from the year before.",
      "Last week, the company announced it was rolling out a super fast EV charging system that it says is nearly as quick as a fill up at the pumps.",
      "BYD\u2019s Hong Kong-traded shares fell 3.2% on Tuesday, despite its upbeat earnings report.",
      "The lion's share, nearly 80%, of BYD's sales last year were related to its automotive businesses. BYD reported it sold about 4.3 million pure electric and hybrid vehicles last year.",
      "Nearly 29% of the company's sales were in markets outside Greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, last year, up slightly from 27% the year before.",
      "The automaker has rapidly expanded its exports, though it has yet to try to sell in the U.S., where U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to raise tariffs on car imports. BYD faces a 17% tariff on exports of EVs to the European Union.",

      "Point Roberts, Washington, is the rare U.S. exclave so dependent on Canada\u2019s goodwill that the strain of Trump\u2019s tariff war is inescapable \u2014 in the grocery store, at the pub and for the majority of residents who never voted for the president",
      "POINT ROBERTS, Wash. -- In the northwest corner of Washington state lies a quirky U.S. exclave so dependent on Canada\u2019s goodwill that the strain of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war is inescapable \u2014 in the sole grocery store, at any of the three eateries, and for the many residents who never voted for him.",
      "Locals and visitors alike in Point Roberts, Washington, are increasingly worried about how this unusual waterfront border town that has embodied the two countries\u2019 interdependency can survive the hostility brewing on both sides.",
      "\u201cThis was really devastating,\u201d said Tamra Hansen, a longtime Point Roberts resident and business owner whose eyes welled with tears as she described her two restaurants on the brink. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the support from the Canadians, this town will die.\u201d",
      "Known as a geographic oddity since the boundary with Canada was drawn in 1846, this detached 5-square-mile community \u2014 called an exclave because it\u2019s completely separated from mainland America \u2014 is surrounded by water on three sides. Its only land connection is to Canada and it takes one border crossing and about 25 miles north by car to get to downtown Vancouver, B.C.; or two border crossings and about 25 miles through Canada to re-enter the United States along Boundary Bay.",
      "The beaches, marina, golf course and hiking trails have long made Point Roberts a cherished getaway destination, but today locals say business has never been worse. Canadian visitors are staying away and some American residents say they\u2019ve even been harassed over their nationality.",
      "Point Roberts Fire Chief Christopher Carleton said Point Roberts is one the last remaining untouched natural gems of the United States, but the tight-knit community with no stop lights is now under threat by politicians who know nothing about their way of life.",
      "\u201cWe need to take care of one another and have grace for one another and not allow people who don\u2019t even know we exist to disrupt the relationships we currently have,\u201d said Carleton, whose firefighters mostly live across the border.",
      "Tensions between the U.S. and Canada have spiked to a level not seen before in modern times thanks to Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again threat over the past two months to place taxes on a long list of goods going across the border. In response, Canada has promised retaliatory tariffs.",
      "For a population that has famously prided itself on being nice, polite and loyal allies, Canadians aren\u2019t hiding their disgust for Trump\u2019s polarizing rhetoric, especially taking offense with the U.S. president\u2019s claim that Canada could be the \u201c 51st state.\u201d",
      "Mark Nykolaichuk said he refuses to go to the mainland U.S. but describes Point Roberts as a unique exception because the border here has never felt like an actual divide for Canadians like him who grew up visiting.",
      "Most of the property owners here are from Canada, and many of the 1,000 year-round residents have dual citizenship. Once a booming fishing town, the leading industry now, according to U.S. Census data, is retail \u2014 primarily driven from tourism because of the number of vacation properties. The unincorporated Whatcom County community is now mostly home to retirees, though this year there are seven students \u2014 nicknamed \u201cThe Borderites\" \u2014 at the lone public school.",
      "Nykolaichuk, who lives in the Vancouver, B.C. area, said he hopes he can help keep the Point Roberts International Marketplace open by shopping there, given that management reports business is down 20% to 30%. He depends on Point Roberts\u2019 only grocery store to be able to cook at his vacation home because U.S. customs doesn\u2019t permit raw meat to enter its borders, for example, so he must buy it in town.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to see this place shut down,\u201d Nykolaichuk said. \u201cIf this place goes, where are the U.S. citizens going to eat? Where are they going to get their food from?\u201d",
      "Many in Point Roberts don\u2019t blame the Canadians for their disdain over Trump\u2019s perceived sovereignty threat. Instead, there\u2019s a deep sadness for both sides.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always gotten along and it\u2019s just nonsensical because now the U.S. is going to suffer too,\u201d said Hansen, who is a dual citizen. \u201cI definitely feel for the Canadian people at this time because they\u2019ve got their backs against the wall, really, and they have to retaliate.\u201d",
      "Like many locals, Larry Musselwhite, owner of Larry\u2019s Liquor Locker, is angry at Trump and blames the president for Point Roberts\u2019 economic problems. The 75-year-old said he can\u2019t even think about retiring right now because of the economy. His liquor store was down 40% in sales last month.",
      "\u201cThis is because of our elected president, who really doesn\u2019t care about the common man and the struggles that we have to go through,\u201d Musselwhite said. \u201cIt greatly affects how I live my life.\u201d",
      "About 75% of the Point Roberts precinct voted for a presidential candidate other than Trump, which is a higher percentage than across Whatcom County as well as the statewide turnout, according to the 2024 election results.",
      "Locals say one of the most frustrating things about the tit-for-tat is the way that the tariffs have abruptly started and stopped, creating an unsteady flow of changes to customs. The whiplash for residents who often cross the border multiple times a day leaves them unsure whether or when they\u2019ll be surprised with a new penalty.",
      "This fear over unexpected tariff fees has made people cautious about buying things in Point Roberts \u2014 if they\u2019re coming into town at all.",
      "Hugh Wilson, a real estate agent who also manages several local Airbnb listings, said properties have seen more cancellations than bookings lately.",
      "\u201cNobody is sure of the rules at any one day here,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe border agents do the best they can to stay up to date and they relay that to us as normal people crossing the border.\u201d",
      "With no end in sight, there\u2019s also a high-stakes fear that the dispute could escalate with Canada possibly imposing tariffs on the water and electricity that it supplies to Point Roberts, or even turning off the utilities altogether.",
      "\u201cIf it gets more brutal, they can cut off the water just like that, or the power,\u201d said Brian Calder, a fourth-generation resident who was previously the president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAnd it just depends how much more confrontation is fomented by Trump\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Calder said he and other town leaders are trying to plead for help with the British Columbia premier and the governor of Washington state. He said the local Whatcom County leadership has all but abandoned this far-away community in a time of crisis.",
      "Jed Holmes, a spokesman for the county, said they are communicating with Washington state's congressional delegation in D.C. to address the rapid deterioration in U.S.-Canada relations that has especially affected Point Roberts.",
      "\u201cI understand that folks want us to do more, but it\u2019s really challenging to identify what meaningful things a county government can do to change this dynamic at the international level,\u201d Holmes said in an email.",
      "For Hansen, she\u2019s asking herself how much more can she afford to lose personally while running the Saltwater Cafe breakfast spot and a restaurant called The Pier. She has 15 employees to pay but business was down 55% in February compared with last year. There have been times when her pub doesn\u2019t even net $100 a day.",
      "\u201cThere are some businesses that are going out of business right now as we speak,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional for me because I care about everybody that lives here.\u201d",

      "Bayer must pay damages to a man who says Roundup weed killer caused his cancer.",
      "NEW YORK -- A jury in Georgia has ordered Monsanto parent Bayer to pay nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who says the company's Roundup weed killer caused his cancer, according to attorneys representing the plaintiff.",
      "The verdict marks the latest in a long-running series of court battles Monsanto has faced over its Roundup herbicide. The agrochemical giant says it will appeal the verdict, reached in a Georgia courtroom late Friday, in efforts to overturn the decision.",
      "The penalties awarded include $65 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages, law firms Arnold & Itkin LLP and Kline & Specter PC said in a statement. That marks one of the largest legal settlements reached in a Roundup-related case to date.",
      "Plaintiff John Barnes filed his lawsuit against Monsanto in 2021, seeking damages related to his non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Arnold & Itkin attorney Kyle Findley, the lead trial lawyer on the case, said the verdict will help put his client in a better position to get the treatment he needs going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road for him ... and he was happy that the truth related to the product (has) been exposed,\u201d Findley told The Associated Press on Sunday. He called the verdict an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d after \"another example of Monsanto\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for poisoning people with this toxic product.\u201d",
      "Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, has continued to dispute claims that Roundup causes cancer. But the company has been hit with more than 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and set aside $16 billion to settle cases.",
      "In a statement, Monsanto said Friday's verdict \u201cconflicts with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of regulatory bodies and their scientific assessments worldwide.\u201d The company added that it continues \u201cto stand fully behind the safety\u201d of Roundup products.",
      "For a variety of crops \u2014 including corn, soybeans and cotton \u2014 Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller\u2019s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.",
      "Some studies associate Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Still, numerous lawsuits over the weedkiller allege glyphosate does cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, arguing that Monsanto has failed to warn the public about serious risks for years.",
      "Findley said that evidence relating to Barnes' case show \u201cmany years of cover-ups\" and \u201cbackroom dealings.\u201d He accused Monsanto of ignoring several scientific studies related to the toxicity of Roundup and said the company \u201ctried to find ways to persuade and distract and deny the connection between this product and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\u201d",
      "Friday's decision marks the fourth Roundup-related verdict that Findley's team has won to date \u2014 the largest of which was awarded in Philadelphia in January 2024, with damages totaling $2.25 billion.

      "There\u2019s a lot of information (and money) on the table during tax season",
      "NEW YORK -- There's a lot of information (and money) on the table during tax season. That also makes it a prime time for scams.",
      "Year-round, fraudsters may use a handful of common tactics to try to steal your identity, money or other sensitive information. As you prepare your annual tax return, due April 15, experts stress it's important to be extra vigilant.",
      "This year, scammers might take particular advantage of uncertainty stemming from recent workforce cuts impacting thousands of jobs at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. These layoffs and the potential for even more widespread reductions also raise questions about resources, including the IRS's bandwidth to respond to scams reported by consumers.",
      "Here's what to know about tax scams and how to stay safe:",
      "Tax scammers may try to reach you in a number of different ways \u2014 from lookalike emails, texts or phone calls impersonating the IRS to unsolicited social media offers that promise a suspiciously high refund. But there are a handful of common red flags to keep an eye out for, including:",
      "\u2014 Sense of urgency",
      "\u2014 Isolation tactics or threats",
      "\u2014 Promises of a big payday",
      "\u2014 Suspicious website links",
      "Cybersecurity experts stress that scammers prey on emotion \u2014 and will often try to evoke fear or uncertainty. Many tax scams will ask you to act fast or click on a malicious link right away. Others will make you think you did something wrong, going as far as threatening an arrest if you don't respond. Scammers may also isolate you from contacting others, such as a trusted accounting professional or even a family member.",
      "Many tax scams also advertise big payouts, but at a price. Some \"ghost\u201d preparers, for example, will charge you for preparing your tax return \u2014 often with promises of maximizing your refund \u2014 but never sign it. They may then file a fraudulent return in your name, with an inflated income or fake deductions to boost the refund, and switch the bank account listed to claim your money.",
      "The IRS will never initiate contact via email, text or social media with requests for your personal information \u2014 and urges consumers to only use trusted, accredited tax professionals if you need help preparing your return. Those who have fallen victim to scams are also encouraged to report them. You can find more information on the agency's official website.",
      "Tax scams can be all the more convincing if they meet the moment. And this year, experts warn that cyber criminals or \u201csocial engineers\u201d might take particular advantage of uncertainty around the IRS cuts.",
      "\u201cUncertainty is probably one of the biggest motivating emotions that social engineers take advantage of,\u201d said Dave Chronister, a prominent \u201cethical hacker\u201d and CEO of Parameter Security, noting that scammers might use news of these cuts and impersonate the IRS to falsely promise taxpayers \u201cnew\u201d ways of filing.",
      "Similar tactics emerged during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and following legitimate rounds of federal aid \u2014 with some scammers making false claims about additional stimulus checks, for example.",
      "All it takes is just \u201ca little bit of common knowledge\u201d to \u201cnudge you\u201d into trusting them, Chronister explains.",
      "Beyond how scammers use the news, the IRS workforce cuts could slow the agency's ability to actually respond to scams, Chronister and others note. As a result, malicious websites or predatory social media campaigns may not be taken down as quickly \u2014 and victims of fraudulent returns could have to wait longer for answers.",
      "\u201cThere is potential for reduced oversight,\u201d said Chris Pierson, chief executive of cybersecurity firm BlackCloak. \u201cIf you have less individuals to be proactive within an agency that is housing, I mean, an amazing treasure trove of data and information \u2014 that obviously is concerning ... (and could) create a riskier environment for the consumer.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment, the IRS pointed to its \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of common tax scams to watch out for this year, among other steps taxpayers can take to protect themselves from identity theft and fraud. But the agency did not immediately comment on whether recent or future workforce cuts would impact its enforcement resources.",
      "Scams are also becoming more sophisticated, most recently thanks to the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence. Experts warn that this technology is being used create \u201chyper-realistic\u201d phishing messages, including video or audio deepfakes, and can allow scammers to target more people at once through automation.",
      "Pierson also warns of the fallout from recent high-profile data breaches \u2014 including the National Public Data breach, which made headlines last year for reportedly leaking a massive amount of sensitive information on the dark web, including full names, social security numbers, contact information and mailing addresses. Having that information out there could lead to more fraudulent filings, he explains, or \u201cconfidence scams\" \u2014 where cyber criminals share one piece of information they have, like an address, to get people to trust them and share more.",
      "File as soon as you can.",
      "Nobody is eager to sit down and do their taxes, but getting it out of the way early \u2014 and before any scammers potentially try to file something in your name \u2014 makes a huge difference, Chronister explains. He adds that taxpayers can play it safe by sticking to what they know.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve always been using TurboTax, use TurboTax. If you always use an accountant, use your accountant,\" Chronister said. He notes that you should also keep your information safe by password-protecting any past filings downloaded to your device and using a VPN when on public Wi-Fi.",
      "The IRS also suggests setting up an identity protection PIN, a six-digit number that can help protect you from someone else filing in your name. You can also freeze your credit \u2014 which experts recommend as an added line of defense against future identity theft and fraud, even if you haven't been scammed. Freezing your credit prevents any new credit accounts from being created in your name. And you can always temporarily \u201cunfreeze\u201d if a check is needed to rent an apartment or apply for a loan. Credit freezes can be set up through three nationwide credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "And, again, remember that the IRS won't randomly contact you by email, text or phone. When in doubt, go to the official IRS website and reach out directly.",
      "Avoiding scams can also come down to pausing before you click or act on anything. \u201cTake a breath, count to 10 and then go, \u2018OK ... is this too good to be true?'\" Chronister sad. \"'Is my gut telling me something is off?'\u201d",
      "Chronister adds that social engineering is about emotion, not intelligence \u2014 and anyone can fall for it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s human to fall for these (scams),\" he said. \"They\u2019ve been here since the beginning of mankind ... So you have to stay vigilant, but don\u2019t panic. Just keep your gut check going.\u201d",

      "Heathrow executives are defending their response to a fire that shut down Europe\u2019s busiest air hub for almost a day",
      "LONDON -- Heathrow Airport executives on Monday defended their response to a fire that shut down Europe\u2019s busiest air hub for almost a day, after Britain's energy system operator suggested that the facility had enough electricity from other sources to keep running.",
      "More than 1,300 flights were canceled on Friday after a fire knocked out one of the three electrical substations that supply Heathrow with power. More than 200,000 passengers had journeys disrupted, and industry experts say the chaos will cost airlines tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The airport reopened after about 18 hours when Heathrow had reconfigured its power supply \u2014 something Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that \"required hundreds of systems to be safely powered down and then safely powered up with extensive testing.\"",
      "Heathrow said that it ran a full schedule on Saturday and Sunday, with 400,000 passengers passing through on 2,500 weekend flights.",
      "The fire's huge impact raised concern about the resilience of Britain\u2019s energy system to accidents, natural disasters or attacks. The government has ordered an investigation into \u201cany wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Counterterrorism police initially led the investigation into the fire, which came as authorities across Europe gird against sabotage backed by Russia. The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 spy agency has accused Moscow of mounting a \u201cstaggeringly reckless\u201d sabotage campaign against allies of Ukraine, which has been trying to repel Russia's full-scale invasion for more than three years.",
      "Police say they have found \u201cno indication of any foul play,\u201d and the London Fire Brigade said that it's leading the investigation, which is focused on the substation\u2019s electrical distribution equipment.",
      "Gareth Bacon, the transport spokesman of the opposition Conservative Party, said that \"malicious actors ... will undoubtedly have taken note of this weekend\u2019s events.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis episode underlines the urgent need to ensure that our critical infrastructure is safeguarded against both accidental incident and deliberate acts of sabotage by malign actors,\u201d he said in the House of Commons.",
      "Meanwhile, the utility company and airport executives are trading blame.",
      "John Pettigrew, chief executive of energy-supply network National Grid, told the Financial Times that \u201ceach substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow\u201d for the airport to stay open.",
      "\u201cLosing a substation is a unique event \u2014 but there were two others available,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is a level of resilience.\u201d",
      "Heathrow said it had worked to reopen \u201cas soon as safely and practically possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cHundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted,\u201d the airport said in a statement. \u201cGiven Heathrow\u2019s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.\u201d",
      "Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye is also facing questions about why he put the airport\u2019s chief operating officer, Javier Echave, in charge of decision-making as the fire raged early Friday.",
      "Alexander declined to back Heathrow management\u2019s decision-making, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have all the information that they had available when they made the decision.\u201d",
      "\u201cSafety should always be paramount, but, as I say, it was not my decision,\u201d she told the BBC.",

      "Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.",

      "Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges.",

      "Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.",

      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for nighttime rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, Turkish capital Ankara and Turkey\u2019s third-largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said that rubber bullets were used, but the government has denied that.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that more than 50 people were detained, and 16 police officers were injured, following the protests.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate, but said that street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a new appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor,\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ozel announced that the CHP has decided to hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart an alleged attempt by the authorities to appoint a \u201ctrustee chairman\u201d to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that the authorities may be seeking to annul the party\u2019s last congress held in 2023 over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader.",
      "On Friday, the Borsa Istanbul's benchmark index dropped by around 7%, prompting temporary trading suspensions aimed at preventing panic-driven sell-offs.",

They took a ship toward the island to \u201cbear witness,\" which is a Quaker protest tradition, but were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, according to the Greenpeace website.",
      "The U.S. later opted to abandon their nuclear testing grounds on the island, marking Greenpeace's first major victory.",

      "Its work to preserve and restore valuable ecosystems and push back on fossil fuel corporations is centered on nonviolent action. Its protests have ranged from efforts to stop Shell from drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic to demonstrations to put an end to France's atmospheric tests in the South Pacific to campaigns to conserve Canada's coastal rainforest.",

      "For her, as she deals with post-traumatic stress disorder in the discipline, that's major progress.",
      "While other racers compete in the GS on Tuesday at World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Shiffrin plans to squeeze in some training in the slalom. It will be the American standout's only event of the weeklong finals after not qualifying in giant slalom.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion revealed last month that she\u2019s suffering from PTSD after falling in the GS on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont. In the crash, something punctured Shiffrin's side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin skipped the giant slalom at world championships and has raced the discipline three times since, with her best showing 25th place.",
      "But she's back to turning in fast sections at practice in the GS, a discipline that blends speed and technical skill.",
      "\u201cTraining is going well. It\u2019s actually super positive. Training has been improving day-by-day,\u201d Shiffrin said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday before signing autographs for fans. \u201cI'm just trying to get back to the confidence that I was skiing with in Killington when the crash happened. That would be a big goal.\u201d",
      "On that day, Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS as she charged after her 100th World Cup win. The finish line was in sight on her final run, when she lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis.",
      "The all-time winningest Alpine World Cup ski racer then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing. She still doesn't know what led to the puncture wound.",
      "To help with getting back in the giant slalom start gate, she's been working with a psychologist. Leading into world championships and the GS, she checked most of the boxes for PTSD symptoms. A few weeks later in Are, Sweden, she checked fewer.",
      "\u201cMy processing speed and the mind-body connection has come back in a great way,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who earned her 100th World Cup win last month in Italy. \"But every now and then I\u2019ll still have the sort of intrusive images or thoughts cross my mind of crashing or the pain. Normally, it\u2019s in the start gate. If I\u2019m starting to get a little bit tired in a session, I just imagine everything that could go wrong and it\u2019s kind of an intense reaction.",
      "\u201cBut it happens so much less often now. It does feel very true that simply exposure to doing the thing that\u2019s pretty uncomfortable is helpful.\u201d",
      "Following her slalom training session Tuesday, Shiffrin will be watching as New Zealand\u2019s Alice Robinson tries to hold off Italy\u2019s Federica Brignone for the crystal globe in the giant slalom.",
      "The 30-year-old Shiffrin can see glimpses of her GS form returning. She won an Olympic gold medal in the discipline at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and 22 of her 100 World Cup victories have come in giant slalom.",
      "\u201cSome of my turns are competitive with the fastest in the world,\u201d said Shiffrin, whose slalom race is Thursday. \u201cBut putting that together for a minute and 10-second GS run \u2014 that just takes time and repetition. We\u2019ll need to try to get some days this summer with long course sets, with a lot of variation of course sets, variation of conditions. I don\u2019t doubt that I can get to that competitive level again.",

      "\u201cThroughout it all, Cain has shown courage and strength of character,\" Hessling said in a statement. \u201cHe has taken responsibility for his actions and has been held accountable. The sentence handed down today reflects the complexities of the situation and acknowledges the man behind the headlines.\u201d",
      "Less than a week prior to the shooting, Goularte was arrested in connection to the sexual assault of a 4-year-old at the daycare owned by his family. He was released without bail a few days later. Officials said he was released under house arrest and was on his way to retrieve an electronic monitoring bracelet when Velasquez attacked.",
      "Velasquez shot at Goularte's truck in a car chase that lasted for 11 miles (17.7 kilometers), the district attorney\u2019s office said. Goularte was uninjured, but his stepfather, who was driving, was hit twice.",
      "Velasquez has said the sexual assault incident involved his child and is suing Goularte and his family\u2019s daycare for negligence and sexual battery.",
      "On his former teammate Kyle Kingsbury's podcast, Velasquez said the way he handled the situation was \u201cnot the way to do it.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think the main thing is the mentality of it,\" Proctor said after Sunday's second-round win against Baylor. \"I'm just shooting knowing the ball is going to go in and not hoping it's going in as the big thing.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-6 guard from Australia has made 19 of 28 3-pointers (67.9%) since missing his first two attempts in the ACC title-game win against Louisville. And he's only gotten hotter with each passing possession.",
      "First came a 6-for-8 output in the first round against Mount St. Mary's \u2014 the kind of shooting display that's typically more of a one-game blip than a sustained push.",
      "Only he topped that two days later, making 7 of 8 against the Bears.",
      "That's 13 for 16 through two March Madness games, a shocking 81.3% hit rate. The 13 made 3s are the most of any player in the Sweet 16, with Houston's LJ Cryer and Tennessee's Chaz Lanier each hitting 10 as the only other players to reach double figures so far.",
      "And Proctor is striking from a variety of ways: on the catch in transition, curling around a screen, using a stepback, even pump-faking a defender off his feet and then resetting off a single dribble to his right \u2014 a move he pulled three times to send a Baylor player flying by on Sunday.",
      "As he kept burying the Bears, he flashed triumphant gestures and unleashed I'm-feeling-it screams toward a home-state crowd as he retreated back to the defensive end.",
      "\u201cSuch a talented player, such a weapon for us when he\u2019s being confident looking for his shot,\u201d freshman star Cooper Flagg said.",
      "The Blue Devils (33-3) have long counted on Proctor as a starter with perimeter length, giving him the ability to create matchup problems at both ends for smaller guards. He has long been a complementary scorer behind Flagg and another freshman in Kon Knueppel, and was averaging 11.8 points entering the Louisville game.",
      "But his kicked-up offense behind that 3-point shot through the last three games has increased his scoring average by approaching a full point (12.5).",
      "It was hard to see this coming as recently as 10 days ago.",
      "After a strong start to February, Proctor's outside shot suddenly abandoned him. Over the next seven games, he would miss 23 of 29 3-pointers, including a pair of 0-for-5 days to start the ACC Tournament. By the time he missed his first two against Louisville in the final, Proctor had missed 14 straight 3s going back to missing his last two in the regular-season finale at rival North Carolina.",
      "Proctor spent time looking at film of his shot with assistant Will Avery after the first two games of the ACCs, trying to decipher where things were misfiring.",
      "\u201cIt's just little things \u2014 just my balance and stuff like that,\" Proctor said. \"At the end of the day, it's just confidence. As soon as my feet get set and I hold my follow-through, I'm just going to keep trusting it.",
      "\"All the 0-for, whatever it was, all that felt good. A couple of them I knew what I did wrong. I think it's just realizing and understanding that, and just fixing it on the fly is a big thing.\u201d",
      "It's a challenge any shooter can understand: finding a delicate balance of tweaking any deficiencies showing up in the form, yet not meddling too much with what has worked for so long.",
      "So far it's working.",
      "\u201cIt's hard, earlier this season I struggled with that,\" Knueppel said. \u201cYou've just got to keep shooting it, that's the only way you can make more shots, is you keep shooting them. So he's done a great job of just being confident. He's really attacking his catches and getting locked and loaded, and ready to go.\u201d",

    "summary": "Tests are underway at Cortina&rsquo;s controversial Olympic sliding track",
    "story": [
      "Tests are underway at Cortina\u2019s controversial Olympic sliding track",
      "ROME -- When Italian skeleton competitor Mattia Gaspari became the first athlete to test the controversial sliding track for next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, he did so in a sort of tunnel under a temporary roof built of wooden beams and white plastic paper.",
      "That's because the sliding center in Cortina d'Ampezzo is still under construction and the only part that is really finished is the track structure.",
      "Still, getting to this point little more than a year after construction began is a big achievement for the Italian government, which rebuilt the century-old track despite calls from the International Olympic Committee to hold bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes at a venue in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite an adventure,\u201d Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the construction firm, which was the first one to believe in this, and the journalists who motivated us,\u201d said Salvini, who is also the deputy premier, citing articles claiming that the project would never be done. \u201cWell, here we are.\u201d",
      "Olympic bronze medalist Dominik Fischnaller was the second athlete down the track on his luge before Simone Bertazzo and Eric Fantazzini made a two-man bobsled run.",
      "Simico, the government agency in charge of the 118 million euro ($128 million) project, reported positive results for the test runs. But it will be officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation and the IOC to determine whether to bestow preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track.",
      "Preliminary approval would be a big step in avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time. Lake Placid officials were hopeful that, if the sliding events were going to be awarded to the U.S., the official word would come by the end of March.",
      "Construction on the Cortina track began in February last year. The pre-homologation plan calls for athletes to begin their initial runs from the junior start, well below the ramps from where they would begin to race for World Cup and Olympic competitions. Sliders would move up the track slowly throughout the coming days.",
      "There are testing events at the Cortina track for all three sliding sports \u2014 bobsled, skeleton and luge \u2014 scheduled for throughout the fall. Those are important so that sliders can familiarize themselves with the track and feel safe there when competing at the Olympics. Safety has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "Luge athletes are scheduled to have an international training period at the new track from Oct. 27 through Nov. 2, then return for a test event there in the final week of November. The bobsled and skeleton tours will hold their international training period from Nov. 7-16, followed by the season-opening World Cup races there from Nov. 17-23.",
      "The 1.749-kilometer (1.09-mile) track features 16 curves with an estimated top speed of 145 kph (90 mph) with run times slated for 55-60 seconds.",
      "Athletes from 12 nations are involved in the tests this week. It's about 60 athletes in all, about half of them being Italian sliders. Coaches representing at least 23 different sliding nations were also invited to view this week's events.",

    "story": [
      "There almost certainly won\u2019t be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball\u2019s next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters",
      "There almost certainly won't be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball's next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters.",
      "Still, plenty of talented players are going into their final seasons before potentially becoming free agents for the first time.",
      "Vladimir Guerrero Jr., five-tool player Kyle Tucker and starting pitchers Dylan Cease, Framber Valdez and Zac Gallen could all become available to other teams after this season. Three-time batting champion Luis Arr\u00e1ez and Bo Bichette, who twice led the American League in hits, could also be first-time free agents.",
      "Guerrero, like Soto already a four-time All-Star and Home Run Derby champion at age 26, had set a self-imposed deadline for negotiating a long-term agreement with Toronto. That passed at the start of spring training without a new deal, when he said he wanted to stay but would listen to other teams in free agency.",
      "Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro remained optimistic going into the season that the team would eventually sign the first baseman to a contract extension.",
      "Soto\u2019s $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in December came after Ohtani got a $700 million, 10-year deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers the previous offseason. Guerrero told ESPN in an interview after his deadline passed that he was seeking a similar contract length as Soto but noted that his last offer was for less than $600 million.",
      "Here are some of the players eligible for free agency after this year\u2019s World Series:",
      "Guerrero, who will make $28.5 million this season, hit a career-best .323 last year with a .940 OPS, 30 homers and 103 RBIs in his fourth consecutive All-Star season. Over six seasons with the Blue Jays, he has a .288 average with 160 homers and 507 RBIs in 819 games. He finished second in the 2021 AL MVP voting behind unanimous choice Ohtani.",
      "Houston clearly wasn't planning to pay the price to keep Tucker in free agency, so the Astros traded the three-time All-Star and Gold Glove-winning right fielder to Chicago in December for a third baseman, starting pitcher and top prospect outfielder that are all under team control for multiple seasons. The 28-year-old Tucker was limited to 78 games last year because of a fractured right shin, and still hit 23 homers. He had a combined 59 homers, 219 RBIs and 55 stolen bases in 2022-23.",
      "The 29-year-old Cease has 130 starts over the last four seasons, twice finishing in the top four in Cy Young Award voting. He was the AL runner-up behind unanimous winner Justin Verlander while with White Sox in 2022, and fourth in the NL last year when 14-11 with a 3.47 ERA in 33 starts after being traded to the playoff-bound Padres during spring training from a Chicago team that went on to lose 121 games. Cease has 1,016 career strikeouts in 847 1/3 innings.",
      "One of the game's best left-handed starters, the 31-year-old Valdez has a 68-41 career record and is Houston's opening-day starter for the fourth year in a row. He was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA in 28 games last season, his fifth in a row to finish with a winning record. The workhorse threw a no-hitter in 2023 and averaged more than 191 innings the past three years.",
      "The 29-year-old Gallen, 14-6 last year, is 43-19 with a 3.20 ERA in 93 starts the past three seasons. Arizona got him his rookie season in 2019 when it traded Jazz Chisholm Jr. to Miami. The Diamondbacks just gave 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner and four-time All-Star right-hander Corbin Burnes a $210 million, six-year deal, the richest in franchise history. That could significantly impact whether they will also be able to keep Gallen, twice a top-five finisher in Cy Young voting.",
      "Arr\u00e1ez has back-to-back 200-hit seasons, part of three batting titles in a row while finishing each of those seasons with a different team. The Padres acquired him last year in a midseason trade from Miami, which got him from Minnesota after his first batting title with the Twins in 2022. He goes into this season with a .323 career average and only 194 strikeouts in 2,858 career plate appearances.",
      "A calf injury and then a broken right middle finger limited Bichette to 81 games last season, and the 27-year-old two-time All-Star hit a career-low .225 with only four homers. Before that, he led the AL in hits in 2021 and 2022, and batted .306 in 2023 during his third consecutive 20-homer season.",
      "Ozuna, who turns 35 next November, played in all 162 games for the first time last year and was an All-Star for the third time \u2014 first since 2016. He has 79 homers and 204 RBIs over the past two years.",
      "Bieber had 20 strikeouts in 12 scoreless innings last season before Tommy John surgery and becoming a free agent for the first time. Cleveland re-signed the 2020 AL Cy Young winner even though he won\u2019t pitch until later this season, during which the pitcher with a 62-32 career record turns 30. He does have a $16 million player option for 2026.",
      "34-year-old catcher J.T. Realmuto, 32-year-old slugger Kyle Schwarber and 29-year-old left-handed starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez are going into the final seasons of their contracts with the Phillies after being key figures for three consecutive playoff seasons. That began with that 2022 NL pennant that ended a decade-long postseason drought. Schwarber has 131 homers and 302 RBIs in that three-season span, along with 318 walks and 612 strikeouts.",

      "Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat will be linked one last time",
      "MIAMI -- Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat will be linked one last time.",
      "And then, they\u2019ll be on opposite sides \u2014 just like they were in his final weeks as a member of the team.",
      "The Heat will pay tribute to Butler\u2019s 5\u00bd seasons with the team with a pregame video on Tuesday night, one that will be shown in the arena as part of the introduction of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 starting lineup for the game.",
      "Butler said he\u2019ll watch the video, though added that it didn\u2019t matter to him whether the Heat did one or not. He\u2019s insisting that there\u2019s no hard feelings now, a month and a half after he was traded to the Warriors following a contentious breakup that saw him suspended by Miami three times in his final weeks with the team.",
      "He wasn\u2019t happy with the Heat, not getting an extension and had issues with his role. The Heat weren\u2019t happy with how he missed about 25% of their games during his tenure with the club and how he took his complaints public in the final months.",
      "Butler got his extension \u2014 two years, $111 million \u2014 from the Warriors, and Golden State was 16-3 in his first 19 appearances with the team entering Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always painted as the bad guy,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve always been a problem. We\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t got nothing to say. I\u2019m not mad at being a bad guy. It\u2019s all the way everything\u2019s portrayed. Some people talk to the media, some people don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been one to tell my side of the story to almost anybody. Let everybody think that this is what happened. We\u2019ll ride with it.\u201d",
      "Fans, as they tend to be when a top player leaves their team, have not been shy about hiding their anger with Butler on social media. Butler knows things didn\u2019t end well in his Miami tenure, though notes that he believes there\u2019s more than enough blame to go around for the messy breakup.",
      "\u201cI wonder if they look at the Heat the same way,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like I was the one who was doing everything. It\u2019s got to be 50-50, maybe 51-49 \u2014 49 towards them, 51 towards me. But there\u2019s no way that I was the cause of all of this.\u201d",
      "Butler wound up being suspended for a total of 14 Heat games before the trade. But the Heat have a tradition of welcoming back players who were All-Stars or champions with the team; Butler was an All-Star in Miami who led the team to three Eastern Conference finals berths and two trips to the NBA Finals.",

      "Viktor Hovland can sound like a player who is bent on perfection",
      "Golf doesn't have to be that complicated. Viktor Hovland only makes it sound that way.",
      "Hovland was confounding as ever at the Valspar Championship. His confidence was so low that he arrived at Innisbrook uncertain if he was even going to play, and then five days later he delivered two clutch swings during the toughest stretch on the Copperhead course to rally for a one-shot victory he never saw coming.",
      "Only the trophy was satisfying.",
      "\u201cYeah, it's still not great,\u201d he said when asked if he was happy with his swing.",
      "Hovland rarely is. And that's why the 27-year-old Norwegian star could say without sounding offensive how proud he was to win on such a tough golf course \u201cwith not my best stuff.\u201d",
      "There is constant searching, not just to win but to hit shots the way he expects. Hovland has questions and he wants answers, and he won't stop looking until he finds them.",
      "He is not wired like Dustin Johnson, who made a career-defining decision to go from hitting a draw to hitting a fade. After winning the U.S. Open and a World Golf Championship in consecutive starts in 2016, Johnson was asked how he went about making such a big change.",
      "\u201cWell, I was just struggling with the draw to get it in the fairway,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to hit a fade.' And I started hitting a fade.\u201d",
      "Simple, right?",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have had the same swing coach since they were about 8. Hovland has made 11 coaching changes since leaving Oklahoma State in 2019, some of them brought back on more than one occasion.",
      "What hasn't changed is his mission \u2014 to hit pure shots \u2014 no matter how many detours.",
      "Hovland reached what looked like the summit in August 2023 when he had a 65-61 weekend at Olympia Fields to win the BMW Championship, and then a 66-63 weekend at East Lake to win the Tour Championship and capture the FedEx Cup. He went 3-1-1 at the Ryder Cup, including partnering with Ludvig Aberg for a 9-and-7 win over Scheffler and Brooks Koepka.",
      "He returned from a winter's break in Norway and felt lost again.",
      "It was at Bay Hill a year ago when Hovland was asked the difference between winning without his best stuff or hitting it great and finishing fifth.",
      "\u201cI guess that\u2019s kind of the insane part of my brain is that I just enjoy flushing a golf shot,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re out here to compete and win tournaments. But I really just cherish being able to hit the shots exactly the way I want to. I think it\u2019s a better predictor of how you\u2019re going to play in the future.\u201d",
      "Therein lies the secret. He can win without his best stuff because he's very good. What he lacks is consistently strong finishes. He has never gone more than five straight tournaments in the top 10, which pales compared with the elite in the game.",
      "But he can contend out of nowhere, such as his third place in the PGA Championship last year at Valhalla when he wondered why he even bothered showing up. That wasn't a threat, more a state of his mind. He also was runner-up at a FedEx Cup playoff event last year.",
      "He doesn't doubt his ability, only what he has referred to as the \u201cmachinery.\u201d",
      "Perfection in golf is something to chase, not attain. That's why Hovland was amused at the label of being a perfectionist.",
      "\u201cI guess you can use that word to describe it,\u201d he said. \"I just view it as if you put your heart and soul into doing something, you might as well do it right. I\u2019ve swung the club extremely well and I think my ball striking has been really, really good over a long period of time. And then when it\u2019s not doing that, I\u2019m going to work on that, I\u2019m going to figure it out.",
      "\u201cI find it kind of weird that we\u2019re professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, \u2018Oh he\u2019s a perfectionist, he\u2019s out on the perimeter searching too much.\u2019 That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments.\"",
      "That's worked out just fine for Bryson DeChambeau, renowned for going down rabbit holes and leaving enough bread crumbs to find his way out if needed.",
      "Hovland won with intelligent course management and good fortune. He could feel the club being out of position at the top, forcing him to try to save it on the way down. The timing worked in his favor at Innisbrook, particularly that 7-iron to 5 feet on the 16th hole Sunday.",
      "And so the trophy from the Valspar Championship is in hand \u2014 his 11th worldwide \u2014 and the search continues. He is back with Grant Waite (for the second time), and the immediate goal is to be ready for the Masters. He\u2019s not sure the swing he had at Innisbrook will work at Augusta National.",
      "The chase continues, with no apologies.",
      "\u201cWhen you're struggling with something, it's just problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd problems are usually a lack of information. I would encourage people to go out and seek more information and try it out for yourselves. See if it helps your problems. And if it doesn't, then you've got to seek more answers. And you keep going and keep going.\u201d",

      "Stanford fired football coach Troy Taylor following a report last week that he had been investigated twice for allegedly mistreating staffers",
      "STANFORD, Calif. -- Stanford fired football coach Troy Taylor following a report last week that he had been investigated twice for allegedly mistreating staffers.",
      "General manager Andrew Luck announced the decision on Tuesday in his first major move since taking over in his role running the entire football program.",
      "\u201cSince beginning my role as general manager, I have been thoroughly assessing the entire Stanford football program,\u201d Luck said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cIt has been clear that certain aspects of the program need change. Additionally, in recent days, there has been significant attention to Stanford investigations in previous years related to coach Taylor. After continued consideration it is evident to me that our program needs a reset. In consultation with university leadership I no longer believe that coach Taylor is the right coach to lead our football program.\u201d",
      "ESPN reported last week that Taylor had been investigated twice since taking over before the 2023 season over allegations of hostile and aggressive behavior, as well as personal attacks, against female staff members.",
      "Both investigations determined that Taylor\u2019s treatment of employees, particularly of women, was inconsistent with Stanford\u2019s standards, according to ESPN.",
      "The second investigation concluded that Taylor retaliated against a compliance staffer who had found seven minor NCAA infractions by \u201cseeking her removal from her assigned duties.\u201d",
      "The report said investigators had never encountered \u201cthis palpable level of animosity and disdain\u201d for a university compliance office, according to ESPN.",
      "Luck thanked Taylor for his time but said it was important to instill the proper culture at Stanford.",
      "\u201cWe have powerful traditions, incredible student-athletes, and a vision for the future that demonstrates our strong potential as a program,\u201d Luck said. \"This vision includes an emphasis on a positive, winning, and inclusive culture. I am confident that we will return Stanford to the top echelon of college football.\u201d",
      "Luck was hired last November to oversee the football program and he reports directly to school President Jonathan Levin. Athletic director Bernard Muir announced last month that he is leaving at the end of the academic year and Stanford is looking for a replacement.",
      "But Luck will be in charge of the football program and now needs to find a coach who can get the Cardinal back to being competitive nationally.",
      "From Luck's first season as starting quarterback in 2009 through the 2018 season, the Cardinal were tied for the sixth most wins in FBS, playing in three Rose Bowls and two other BCS bowls in a 10-year span.",
      "But Stanford is 20-46 in six seasons since then, with its .303 winning percentage ranking second worst to Vanderbilt among all power conference teams in that span.",
      "Taylor was hired after David Shaw stepped down in 2022 after his second straight 3-9 season. Taylor, who had helped build Sacramento State into an FCS power, went 3-9 in each of his two seasons with the Cardinal. Stanford went just 1-10 at home against FBS opponents under Taylor.",

      "Houston coach Kelvin Sampson knows his team can always rely on defense to win games",
      "Houston and Gonzaga met in a second-round NCAA Tournament matchup last weekend in Wichita, Kansas, that could as easily have been played in the Final Four, the way Kelvin Sampson's and Mark Few's teams had played throughout the season.",
      "The Cougars were No. 1 in scoring defense, more than a half-point better than the next-best team. The Bulldogs were No. 2 in scoring offense, trailing only Alabama in putting up nearly 87 points per game.",
      "Yet one of the biggest reasons that Houston was able to advance to the Sweet 16 with an 81-76 victory over the Bulldogs was its ability to play any style of basketball. Sure, the Cougars managed to hold Gonzaga nearly 10 points below its season average, but they also ramped up their own scoring, proving that they are more than just a bunch of defensive stoppers.",
      "\u201cJust win and advance,\u201d Sampson said afterward. \u201cDo what it takes. That's all that matters.\u201d",
      "Throughout the 68-team field, those that were able to survive the first weekend were often those that were willing to change things up if the moment dictated it. The defensive dynamo was able to get into transition and pile up points, or the team that loves to score buckled down at the other end of the floor, making life difficult for its unsuspecting opponent.",
      "That has been the case with Mississippi so far in the tournament.",
      "The Rebels rolled into the postseason in the top 50 nationally in scoring, but their defense was middling at best: 175th out of the 364 teams in men's Division I basketball. Yet the same bunch who scored 98 points against Kentucky and 100 against Oral Roberts in the regular season stifled North Carolina in a 71-64 first-round win, then held Iowa State below its season scoring average in a 91-78 victory that pushed Ole Miss into the regional semifinals.",
      "\u201cTheir defensive versatility is terrific,\u201d Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger marveled afterward. \u201cTheir switch ability \u2014 guards on bigs, bigs on guards. They do a great job. Their defense really tries to frustrate you by not allowing the ball to get in the paint, and trying to keep it on one side of the floor. And when they're at their best, they're doing that really well.\u201d",
      "It will take Ole Miss doing it at their best with Michigan State up next; the Spartans are among the most versatile of any team left. They are top 50 in both scoring and defense, and they showed it off last weekend, putting up 87 points against Bryant and holding New Mexico to 63 in a pair of wins.",
      "\u201cWe're just a team that can play multiple ways,\u201d the Spartans' Jaden Akins said.",
      "So is Duke, which was fourth nationally in scoring and sixth in scoring defense. And when you have that combination, the results in the opening weekend were not surprising: 93-49 over Mount St. Mary's and 89-66 over Baylor.",
      "Kentucky was sixth nationally in scoring this season, but coach Mark Pope's bunch \u2014 315th in scoring defense \u2014 played a more patient game with plenty of success in a 76-57 first-round win over Wofford. It wasn't a surprise that Arizona averaged 90 points in wins over Akron and Oregon, but it may have been that the Wildcats held the Zips to just 65 in the first round.",
      "Then there's Alabama, which looked every bit like the nation's highest-scoring team in a tougher-than-expected first-round win over Robert Morris and a second-round blitz of Saint Mary's. But the Crimson Tide also looked a lot like, say, Houston the way it defended the Gaels, holding them to just 66 points in advancing to the Sweet 16.",
      "That's where the Crimson Tide will face BYU, a team that plays much more like itself.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to say it\u2019s refreshing to go against somebody that plays like us,\u201d Tide coach Nate Oats said, \"because I think we\u2019re really tough to guard, and we\u2019ve led the country in scoring the last two years. I don\u2019t think anybody is saying it\u2019s refreshing to play Alabama, whoever is running the defense for the other team. I mean, maybe it\u2019s not such a smash-mouth game like playing football out there like some of these teams, but they\u2019re not easy to cover.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to really lock in and coaches are going to have to really do a good job getting our guys ready and then our guys are going to have to execute what the plan is, whatever we decide to put in.\u201d",

      "Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini have won again in court and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors",
      "MUTTENZ, Switzerland -- Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini won again in court Tuesday and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors.",
      "Once soccer\u2019s most powerful men, former FIFA president Blatter and former UEFA president Platini were acquitted for a second time in a case now in its 10th year on charges of fraud, forgery, mismanagement and misappropriation of more than $2 million of FIFA money in 2011.",
      "Blatter, now aged 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers on his desk or held his left hand over his mouth.",
      "Only when the 55-minute verdict statement was over did Blatter smile before reaching across to shake his lawyer's hand. Blatter then shared a long hug with his daughter, Corinne.",
      "\u201cYou have seen my daughter was coming with tears because she believed in (her) father and I believed in myself,\u201d said Blatter, who spoke of a sword of Damocles being removed from over his head. \u201cTo wait such a long time affects the person and my family was very much affected.\"",
      "Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court's verdict in German into his native French.",
      "\u201cThis persecution by FIFA and some Swiss federal prosecutors for 10 years is now finished, is now totally finished,\" Platini said leaving the court, insisting his honor was restored. \"So I\u2019m very happy.\u201d",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office in Switzerland had challenged a first acquittal in July 2022 and asked for sentences of 20 months, suspended for two years. The indictment alleged the payment \u201cdamaged FIFA\u2019s assets and unlawfully enriched Platini.\u201d",
      "\u201cMichel Platini must finally be left in peace in criminal matters,\u201d his lawyer Dominic Nellen said in a statement. \u201dAfter two acquittals, even the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland must realize that these criminal proceedings have definitively failed.\"",
      "A further appeal to the Swiss supreme court can be filed by the prosecutors' office, which said in a statement it \u201cwill decide about how to further proceed.\u201d",
      "Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that ultimately came to nothing in court yet totally altered world soccer body FIFA.",
      "The legal case swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.",
      "Blatter approved FIFA paying 2 million Swiss francs (now $2.21 million) to France soccer great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential advisor from 1998-2002.",
      "The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly 9\u00bd years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of the two men.",
      "That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at FIFA after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.",
      "With Platini soon suspended and banned by FIFA, European soccer body UEFA ran his long-time secretary general Gianni Infantino as its election candidate. Infantino was a surprise winner in February 2016 and is set to lead FIFA until at least 2031.",
      "Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter\u2019s reputation likely always will be tied to leading FIFA during corruption crises that took down a swath of senior soccer officials worldwide.",
      "Platini, one of soccer\u2019s greatest players and later Blatter\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in soccer politics, never did get the FIFA presidency he often called his destiny.",
      "Neither Blatter nor Platini has worked in soccer since they were suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in October 2015. They were later banned and failed to overturn the bans in separate appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2016.",
      "\u201dThe criminal proceedings have had not only legal but also massive personal and professional consequences for Michel Platini, although no incriminating evidence was ever presented,\" Nellen said, suggesting further legal action \"against those responsible for the criminal proceedings.\u201d",
      "Platini\u2019s ban expired in 2019 and Blatter was given a subsequent ban by FIFA in 2021 months before his first was due to end.",
      "Blatter is exiled from soccer until late in 2028 \u2014 when he will be 92 \u2014 because of an ethics prosecution of alleged self-dealing in eight-figure management bonuses paid for successfully organizing the men\u2019s World Cup in 2010 and 2014.",
      "The verdict was given Tuesday in a low-key provincial courthouse where a four-day trial was held three weeks ago.",
      "Blatter and Platini have claimed at five different judicial bodies \u2014 twice at FIFA, then the Court of Arbitration for Sport and now two Swiss federal criminal courts \u2014 that they had a verbal \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to one day settle the unpaid and non-contracted salary.",
      "Platini was a storied former captain and coach of the France national term when he worked to help Blatter get elected to lead FIFA in Paris on the eve of the 1998 World Cup he organized.",
      "The two men said Platini agreed to be a presidential adviser on an annual salary of 300,000 Swiss francs (now $340,000) through 2002. They claim there was a verbal deal to later get the balance of 1 million Swiss francs for each year that FIFA could not pay at the time.",
      "Platini started asking for the money early in 2010, citing seven-figure payments made to senior Blatter aides who left FIFA which showed the soccer body could afford to pay him. The payment was finally made in February 2011.",
      "Details of the payment only emerged in the crisis that hit FIFA in May 2015 when U.S. federal investigators unsealed a sweeping investigation of international soccer officials. Swiss authorities made early-morning arrests at hotels in Zurich before seizing FIFA financial and business records.",
      "In 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors already were handling a criminal complaint filed by FIFA. That was about suspected financial wrongdoing linked to votes in December 2010 that picked Russia and Qatar as future World Cup hosts.",

      "Several new bars dedicated to women\u2019s sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing",
      "PHOENIX -- When you walk into Title 9 Sports Grill in Phoenix's Melrose District, its mission to be a haven for watching women's sports permeates every nook and cranny. From the over dozen TVs mounted on pink and orange walls to the \u201cPlay Like a Girl!\u201d neon sign against a giant image of retired WNBA star Diana Taurasi.",
      "It's an impressive turnaround for co-owners Audrey Corley and Kat Moore. Just before Christmas, the space was still Moore and her husband Brad's hot dog restaurant. But last summer they sold the business and the new owners didn't want to stay in the property. That's when Corley, who owns a popular lesbian bar on the next block, proposed partnering on the city's first women's sports-centric bar. She had been mulling the idea since reading about the Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, which opened in 2022, and then seeing a half-dozen similar bars emerge in the last year.",
      "\u201cThen I see, you know, another one popped up here and another one. And then I was like, it\u2019s just time. It has to be,\u201d Corley said before Title 9's grand opening earlier this month.",
      "Several new bars dedicated to women's sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing. From San Francisco to Cleveland, there will be more than a dozen across the country before the year is over. The femme-focused bar scene has made huge strides from three years ago when The Sports Bra was the only one. It comes during an exciting first year during which teams in the women's bracket will finally be paid for playing in the NCAA tourney. Many credit stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese for increasing the marketability of female players.",
      "Last season, Reese and Clark's teams never saw a dollar. Now, the women's teams will finally earn individual revenue, known as \u201cunits.\u201d A unit is money paid to conferences when one of its teams appears in the NCAA Tournament. Teams earn another with every game played.",
      "The most seamless part of transforming her old restaurant into Title 9 has been the built-in community anticipation of having a place to view women's sports, Moore said.",
      "\"The only question I\u2019ve gotten from quite a few men, especially when we first started telling people, was, \u2018Are men allowed?\u2019 Yeah!\u201d Moore said, with a chuckle.",
      "Named for the landmark 1972 law that forbids discrimination based on sex in education, including athletics, Title 9 is filled with tributes to female athletes, from framed photos with QR codes to a cocktail roster with drinks such as the Pat Summitt Sour and Taurasi Goat-Tail. However, the owners emphasize a family-friendly atmosphere where young girls can come celebrate after a school game.",
      "\u201cEven some of the little girls, they could come here and dream of being on the TV someday and actually getting paid for it,\u201d Corley said.",
      "Debra Hallum and Marlene du Plessis were also inspired by the Sports Bra. They made their targeted opening in Austin last week of 1972 ATX Women's Sports Pub across from the University of Texas campus. The day included a rainbow ribbon cutting and officials from the Austin LGBT Chamber of Commerce.",
      "While they are in a conservative state, the women have been emphasizing the bar\u2019s LGBTQ-friendliness.",
      "\u201cWe want to be very clear that we will be a very welcoming and inclusive space for all women sports fans,\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want to invite everyone to grow the interest and the viewership, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to fix that gap for women, including the pay gap.\u201d",
      "Neither woman has hospitality experience. Hallum has a corporate background and du Plessis' is in education. But, they researched running a business like this and hired a talented chef and staff. It's clear both are passionate.",
      "\u201cIt is so hard to find a bar or a pub that will show women\u2019s sports,\u201d du Plessis said. \u201cYou always have to call around, ask around to find where they going to show it. And then most of the time you know they will not have the sound on. And we will.\u201d",
      "They've been touched by the reactions from residents, even parents of boys.",
      "\u201cWe had a mom and dad, two daughters and their son show up and (the mom) was all about, 'This is exactly what we need,\u2019\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want our son to be raised knowing that this is just as great and just as wonderful as men\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "In Denver, Annie Weaver and Miranda Spencer met playing on opposing flag football teams. A month later, they began drafting a business plan for a similar concept, also inspired by The Sports Bra. Open since December, the 99ers Sports Bar is now hosting its first March Madness crowds.",
      "They were first mulling a name that would play off of Mia Hamm, the 1990s soccer icon who inspired Weaver\u2019s Halloween costume for years. They settled on a name that honors the 1999 U.S. Women's World Cup soccer team, filled with names and faces that didn't get as much attention as Hamm.",
      "On a recent Sunday, the bar was standing room only as the TVs aired an NWSL game, Unrivaled semifinal games, and the Selection Sunday broadcast announcing the brackets for the NCAA Tournament.",
      "The city doesn\u2019t even have any women\u2019s teams in the major national leagues, but it was recently awarded the 16th NWSL expansion team, to begin play in 2026.",
      "A tri-fold bracket covered one table, and an impromptu friendship bracelet-making station occupied another.",
      "\u201cI wish I would have had this space growing up,\u201d Spencer said.",
      "These new bar operators agree this is not a trend but an indicator of a market that hasn't been served. But hopefully, anyone looking to open a women's sports bar isn't doing it \u201cjust to be trendy,\u201d said Moore, of Title 9.",
      "Corley's most important advice for any would-be barkeep: \"The same way you play sports for the love, open this up for the love.\u201d",

      "WICHITA, Kan. -- It has been nearly two months since American Airlines Flight 5342 lifted off from a wintry runway in southeast Kansas, destined for Washington, D.C., with dozens of members of the tight-knit figure skating community aboard it.",
      "They were just kids, accompanied by parents and coaches, who had been attending a development camp that followed the U.S. championships in Wichita. Many had posted on social media what they had learned \u2014 those jumps and spins and techniques that form the foundation of their sport \u2014 and how eager they were to share their newfound knowledge back home.",
      "They never got that chance. On that January night, their regional jet was on approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport when it collided with an Army helicopter, killing all 67 people aboard the two aircraft.",
      "\u201cI'll always have them in my head and my heart,\u201d said world champion Ilia Malinin, the 20-year-old American wunderkind, who will be defending his title in Boston this week. Some of his fellow members of the Washington Figure Skating Club were aboard Flight 5342, and many of them had cheered him to victory at the U.S. championships.",
      "\u201cStill some days I have some of those thoughts, kind of thinking about it. It does upset me a little bit that some days I won't see them on the ice, training with me and looking up to me,\u201d Malinin continued. \u201cThis worlds, I really want to dedicate to everyone on that flight, and give my all to the performance, and really make it special for them.\u201d",
      "When the world championships begin Wednesday at TD Bank Garden, home of the Bruins and Celtics, they will be hosted by the renowned Skating Club of Boston, which produced such Olympic icons as Tenley Albright, Dick Button and Nancy Kerrigan.",
      "The club was rocked on Jan. 29 when it learned that three of its own young skaters \u2014 Jinna Han, Spencer Lane and Olivia Ter \u2014 and coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov were killed in the crash. The next morning, flowers accumulated in the club\u2019s lobby in nearby Norwood, and a single white rose was placed on a table for each member who died.",
      "Kerrigan and Albright were among those who showed up at the club so they wouldn\u2019t have to grieve alone.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know everybody to feel that connection,\u201d Kerrigan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through the same thing \u2014 that training, that rigorous schedule of falling over and over and somehow picking yourself up, which is the main lesson learned in skating: You get back up, keep on trying. And even when it\u2019s hard, you get back up.\u201d",
      "Time has begun to heal some of the wounds. Others, no doubt, will never fully recover.",
      "The healing was aided in part by a gala celebration earlier this month in Washington that included performances by Malinin, U.S. champion Amber Glenn, and former Olympic champions such as Scott Hamilton, Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi.",
      "It was broadcast locally and streamed on Peacock, and NBC will be airing an encore performance next Sunday.",
      "During the 2-plus hour event, 13-year-old Isabella Aparicio skated in memory of her brother, Franco, and father, Luciano, who were on the flight. Maxim Naumov, who lost his parents in the crash, performed in their honor. The tears were flowing from the best figure skaters of past and present, and more than $1.2 million was raised for the families of those affected.",
      "Now, the world championships provide another chance for the skating community to heal.",
      "International Skating Union president Jae Youl Kim made a tearful announcement during the European championships in Estonia that those killed in the crash would be honored in Boston. The highlight comes Wednesday, on the opening night of competition, when a tribute and remembrance will take place between the women's and pairs short programs.",
      "\u201cThis is almost part of a process of recovery, of dealing with the grief and supporting the families, and then it's still focusing on competition as a way of dealing with all that,\u201d said Sam Auxier, the interim CEO of U.S. Figure Skating. \u201cBoston will be a bit of a peak of all that energy we're seeing now around this tragedy, and how it could become something very positive.\u201d",
      "In that respect, the skating community is rising en masse for the world championships this week. Malinin called it a coincidence \u2014 \u201can unfortunate coincidence,\u201d he said \u2014 that worlds would be taking place on American soil after the crash.",
      "Unfortunate that the crash occurred. Fortuitous that it can provide another chance to honor and remember.",

      "Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl began his postgame NCAA Tournament news conference on Saturday night by advocating for the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas",
      "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl began his postgame NCAA Tournament news conference on Saturday night by advocating for the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.",
      "Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier who grew up in the United States, is one of 59 hostages still in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Last week, Hamas said it would release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages held there since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire agreement.",
      "Pearl, who is Jewish, made the plea for Alexander's return after the top-seeded Tigers' 82-70 victory over No. 9 Creighton, saying he sought his players' permission to bring up the subject.",
      "\u201cI get asked a lot how this basketball program has become so competitive over the last eight years,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cBut for me, I believe it was God\u2019s plan to give us this success, success beyond what we deserve. To give us this platform. To give us an opportunity to start this conference briefly and remind the world that Edan Alexander is still held hostage in Gaza right now. An American held hostage and not enough people in this country know his name.\u201d",
      "Alexander\u2019s father, Adi, said on Friday that he was more optimistic about the chances that the U.S. could secure his son's safe return.",
      "Asked later what made him want to talk about the hostage situation and the Israel-Hamas war, Pearl \u2014 an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump \u2014 referenced his faith and family's migration to the U.S.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was the worst day since the Holocaust for the Jewish people, and they say they want to do it again and again and again. We have American hostages in Gaza right now, and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cAnd President Trump called it out, and said if they just free the hostages, the killing would stop. Free the hostages, and the killing will stop, and that\u2019s up to Hamas.\u201d",

      "\u201cTa\u2019Niya led us with not only her scoring but the way she just wasn\u2019t to be denied,\u201d Florida State coach Brooke Wyckoff said. \u201cShe hit the floor a bunch of times just scrambling to get the ball and make sure we had the possession. She rebounded and I\u2019m just really, really proud of how she led us.\u201d",
      "Mikayla Timpson had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Seminoles (24-8), who advanced to play No. 3 seed LSU in the second round on Monday night.",
      "Latson, the nation's leading scorer, sat out several games in February with an undisclosed injury. But she looked in form on the heels of a two-week break since the Seminoles' ouster from the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament on March 7.",
      "\u201cI felt good during practice \u2014 got my groove back from injury,\u201d Latson said. \u201cThat was something I wanted to harp on, being good in practice so it can translate into the game.\u201d",
      "Paula Suarez scored a career-high 25 points in her final college game and Kennedy Harris added 12 points for George Mason (27-6), which was making its first March Madness appearance after winning the Atlantic 10 Tournament.",
      "\u201cWe are here for a reason. We know we can beat them,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cThey just \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like maybe the physicality or the athleticism and they just started making a lot of shots \u2014 and we weren\u2019t playing our best offense.\u201d",
      "Florida State led by as many as 20 points in the middle of the second quarter, but George Mason pulled within seven in the third period when the second of Suarez's back-to-back 3s made it 49-42.",
      "Wyckoff called timeout at that point, and the Seminoles responded with a 10-0 run during which O'Mariah Gordon scored five points on a fast-break layup and corner 3.",
      "\u201cWe needed to turn up the intensity defensively,\u201d Wyckoff said. \u201cWhen we do that, our defense leads to our offense. That\u2019s what sparks those runs.\u201d",

      "Gordon finished with 18 points and Bowles had 15 on 5-of-5 shooting from deep.",
      "\"We knew we were going to have to, over time, just impose our will with our pace, defensive intensity and wear our opponent down,\" Wyckoff said. \u201cThis team knew what they had to do to finish this game and they did it really well.\u201d",
      "George Mason: Staying within striking distance through three quarters made for a solid NCAA Tournament debut for the Patriots before they faded in the final period.",
      "\u201cThe outcome of this game does not define who they are,\u201d coach Vanessa Blair-Lewis said. \u201cThey have put a legacy in place at Mason. ... That can never be taken away.\u201d",
      "Florida State: The Seminoles are tournament regulars and looked like it when they dominated down the stretch. Florida State is part of March Madness for a 12th straight time and has appeared in 19 of the past 20 NCAA Tournaments.",
      "It was the first NCAA Tournament victory for Wyckoff, now in her third full season after taking over on an interim basis during the 2020-21 season.",
      "\u201cFeels great,\u201d Wyckoff said. \u201cBut I just credit this team ... with the work they put in all season.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "Many of its treasures were hurriedly taken away during World War II to keep them from falling into the hands of the invading Japanese army. During a civil war that brought the Communist Party to power in 1949, the defeated Nationalists took many of the most prized pieces to Taiwan, where they are now housed in the National Palace Museum.",
      "Beijing's Palace Museum has since rebuilt its collection.",
      "Restoration techniques have also evolved, said Qu Feng, head of the museum\u2019s Conservation Department, though the old ways remain the foundation of the work.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Residents of the Tuscany beach enclave of Orbetello are seeking a state of emergency declaration to help combat an invasion of midges that are keeping people indoors and threatening businesses catering to tourists.",
      "Millions of the tiny bugs have invaded Orbetello, a speck of land that juts out into the Orbetello lagoon, a natural reserve off Tuscany's coast between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Monte Argentario.",
      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",
      "On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.",
      "A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to \u201cprotect citizens and economic activities in the area,\u201d Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. But no details were immediately released.",
      "Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition \u201cSave the Orbetello Lagoon\u201d had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.",
      "Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cEverything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,\u201d he warned.",

      "An experimental treatment appears to postpone Alzheimer's symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease at a young age",
      "An experimental treatment appears to delay Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease in their 40s or 50s, according to new findings from ongoing research now caught up in Trump administration funding delays.",
      "The early results \u2014 a scientific first \u2014 were published Wednesday even as study participants worried that politics could cut their access to a possible lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a study but it has given me an extension to my life that I never banked on having,\u201d said Jake Heinrichs of New York City.",
      "Now 50, Heinrichs has been treated in that study for more than a decade and remains symptom-free despite inheriting an Alzheimer\u2019s-causing gene that killed his father and brother around the same age.",
      "If blocked funding stops Heinrichs\u2019 doses, \u201chow much time do we have?\u201d asked his wife, Rachel Chavkin. \u201cThis trial is life.\u201d",
      "Two drugs sold in the U.S. can modestly slow worsening of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing the brain of one of its hallmarks, a sticky gunk called amyloid. But until now, there haven't been hints that removing amyloid far earlier \u2013 many years before the first symptoms appear \u2013 just might postpone the disease.",
      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",
      "In New York, Heinrichs said he has hope that his 3-year-old son won\u2019t \u201cexperience the stress and sorrow that I lived through as a young man to watch my father fade away.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need the NIH to be not politicized,\u201d added Chavkin, his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s just about keeping people alive or helping them live better. And in this case, it\u2019s helping my husband survive.\u201d",

      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers.

      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

      "Dozens of companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more",
      "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- From the grounds of a gas-fired power plant on the eastern shores of Canada, a little-known company is pumping a slurry of minerals into the ocean in the name of stopping climate change.",
      "Whether it\u2019s pollution or a silver bullet that will save the planet may depend on whom you ask.",
      "From shore, a pipe releases a mixture of water and magnesium oxide \u2014 a powdery white mineral used in everything from construction to heartburn pills that Planetary Technologies, based in Nova Scotia, is betting will absorb more planet-warming gases into the sea.",
      "\u201cRestore the climate. Heal the ocean,\u201d reads the motto stamped on a shipping container nearby.",
      "Planetary is part of a growing industry racing to engineer a solution to global warming using the absorbent power of the oceans. It is backed by $1 million from Elon Musk\u2019s foundation and competing for a prize of $50 million more.",
      "Dozens of other companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more. Nearly 50 field trials have taken place in the past four years, with startups raising hundreds of millions in early funds.",
      "But the field remains rife with debate over the consequences for the oceans if the strategies are deployed at large scale, and over the exact benefits for the climate. Critics say the efforts are moving too quickly and with too few guardrails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West. Everybody is on the bandwagon, everybody wants to do something,\u201d said Adina Paytan, who teaches earth and ocean science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.",
      "Planetary, like most of the ocean startups, is financing its work by selling carbon credits \u2014 or tokens representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the air. Largely unregulated and widely debated, carbon credits have become popular this century as a way for companies to purchase offsets rather than reduce emissions themselves. Most credits are priced at several hundred dollars apiece.",
      "The industry sold more than 340,000 marine carbon credits last year, up from just 2,000 credits four years ago, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi. But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",
      "Monetizing the work is uncomfortable for many who study the ocean.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s encouraging more research and more science, which is good. On the other hand, it\u2019s opening doors for abuse of the system,\u201d said Paytan, the Santa Cruz professor, who has been contacted by several startups asking to collaborate.",
      "She pointed to companies that are accused of drastically overestimating the carbon they sequestered, though they bragged of restoring rainforests in Peru and replacing smoke-producing stoves in Africa.",
      "But absent more government-funded research, several companies told AP there\u2019s little way for the field to advance without selling credits.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set things up now, is that we put it in the hands of these startups to develop the techniques,\u201d said Ho.",
      "Back in his shipping container office along Halifax Harbour, Burt said he understood the unease around selling credits, and said Planetary takes seriously the need to operate openly, responsibly and cautiously. But he also says there\u2019s a need for startups that can move at a faster pace than academia.",
      "\u201cWe cannot study this solution at the same rate that we\u2019ve been studying the problems,\u201d he said. He says there\u2019s not enough time.",
      "Last year marked the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, even as global carbon emissions are projected to reach another all-time high.",
      "\u201cWe need to reduce emissions urgently, drastically,\u201d said Fennel, the researcher studying Planetary\u2019s project. \u201cAny removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is much more difficult and costly than avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.\u201d",
      "The industry continues to push forward. Planetary said in February that it had sequestered a total of 1,000 metric tons of carbon in the ocean, and Carboniferous completed its first test of sinking sugarcane to the seafloor. Early this year, Gigablue signed a deal for 200,000 carbon credits for dispersing nutrient-filled particles in the ocean.",
      "A growing number of companies are also using electricity to alter seawater molecules, with the same goal of prompting the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. The startup Ebb Carbon recently struck a deal with Microsoft to provide up to 350,000 carbon credits, and Captura, which is funded in part by investors affiliated with oil and gas production, expanded its operations from California to Hawaii.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. government will stall or support ocean climate work going forward. The policy landscape continues to shift as the Trump administration seeks to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations and reconsider the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.",
      "Though White House adviser Musk has downplayed some of his past statements about global warming, four years ago his foundation committed $100 million to fund a competition for the best solution for carbon capture, of which Planetary is in the running for the top prize.",
      "The winner will be announced April 23 \u2014 the day after Earth Day.",

      "A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",
      "Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",
      "If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations.",
      "Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency's interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed.",
      "In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted \u201csugar-containing products\u201d and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians.",
      "If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it\u2019s best to check and see if what they\u2019re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus.",
      "\u201cJust because somebody has an \u2018M.D.\u2019 after their name doesn\u2019t make them entirely trustworthy,\u201d said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology.",
      "Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they\u2019ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review.",
      "In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.",

      "\"I think right now, the name of the game is uncertainty,\" one former Department of Education probationary employee told ABC News. \"There is a lot of uncertainty about where do things stand, what is going to be next, what protections are we going to be able to maintain.\"",

      "The Trump administration is facing scrutiny over the use of the commercially available app Signal to discuss plans for a U.S. military attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen, but did anyone break the law?",
      "Inadvertently included on the chain was The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, who recounted how he was texted information about weapons packages, targets and timing before the strike unfolded.",
      "Goldberg's report quickly sparked questions about the administration's handling of sensitive defense information, including whether the chat violated the Espionage Act.",
      "The 1917 law \"is the primary statutory vehicle through which the government typically brings criminal prosecutions for mishandling or leaks of classified information,\" said national security attorney Bradley Moss.",
      "Signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson soon after the U.S. entered World War I, the Espionage Act was aimed at cracking down on disloyal wartime activities.",
      "Despite its title, Moss said \"most of the statute has nothing to do with actual espionage and instead more broadly criminalizes the unauthorized storage, dissemination or modification of national defense information.\"",
      "President Donald Trump was charged under the Espionage Act for allegedly mishandling classified materials after his first term, allegations Trump denied. The case was dropped after the 2024 election, with the special counsel citing longstanding Justice Department policy not to prosecute sitting presidents.",
      "The statute was also used in high-profile cases against Pentagon leaker Jack Teixeira, who was sentenced last year to 15 years in prison for exposing defense information, and Chelsea Manning, who was imprisoned for the unauthorized release of hundreds of thousands of classified government documents to WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.",
      "Democrats have called for an investigation into the use of the Signal group chat to discuss a military operation and for some officials involved to be fired or resign.",
      "The White House and top officials have sought to minimize the incident, stating in their defense that there was no classified material involved in the message chain.",
      "\"This was not classified. Now, if it's classified information, it's probably a little bit different,\" Trump said as he was hit with questions on the matter during a meeting with some of his ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The exact content of the messages is unclear. The administration denies they included \"war plans\" though Goldberg said it included operational details of strikes on Yemen, including information about targets and attack sequencing. National Security Council spokesman, in a statement to ABC News on Monday, said the message thread that was reported \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "The Espionage Act, though, predates the modern classification system.",
      "\"In this context, information related to national defense also has to be information the possessor has a reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation,\" said Sam Lebovic, a historian of U.S. politics who has studied the century-old statute.",
      "\"And if, as has been alleged, operational details were in that information, I think you could make the case that would be information which could be used to the injury of the U.S. or to the advantage of a foreign nation. And technically, whether or not it's classified doesn't have bearing on that definition,\" Lebovic said.",
      "Still, the expansive nature of the Espionage Act -- which Lebovic said could cover essentially any disclosure of information related to national defense to someone unauthorized to receive it -- has resulted in it being relatively rarely used other than in the most egregious cases.",
      "\"They're often not prosecuted because the law is so broadly written, it gives prosecutors a great deal of discretion to decide when to bring charges and when not to,\" Lebovic said.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel was questioned by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Tuesday in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on whether his bureau would investigate the incident. Patel said he had just been briefed on the matter Monday night and Tuesday morning and didn't have an update. Warner asked for one by the end of the day.",
      "Officials with the White House's National Security Council said they \"are reviewing\" how a reporter was added to the Signal chat, though the scope of the review, including whether it would attempt to determine why high-level discussions about military planning were taking place outside of official channels, was not immediately clear.",

      "He said the invitation was \"not an unusual thing in Washington.\"",
      "\"I'm a journalist, I've met him in the past, so I accept it,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Goldberg said he accepted the request, with nothing occurring until several days later, when he was added to a \"group of seemingly very high national security officials of the United States\" including Vice President JD Vance, with Waltz apparently creating this chat.",
      "\"Mike Waltz puts this group together and says it's a planning group for essentially upcoming action in Yemen,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he initially thought it was a hoax since it would be \"completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News a \"long conversation\" occurred between the group chat members on March 14, discussing \"whether or not they should or shouldn't take action in Yemen.\"",
      "The messages went back and forth with \"a lot of resentment directed at European allies of the United States, which obviously enhanced the credibility of this chain,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He told ABC News at this point the members of the chat sounded like people he knew within the administration, but still was not sure whether or not it was a hoax.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he continued to track the incoming messages from the group chat, to see \"who was trying to entrap me or trick me.\" Then on March 15, he said it became \"overwhelmingly clear\" it was a legitimate group chat, he told ABC News.",
      "At 11:44 a.m., he said he received a text in the chain from someone claiming to be Hegseth, or \"somebody identified as Pete,\" providing what Goldberg characterized as a war plan. The message included a \"sequencing of events related to an upcoming attack on Yemen\" and promised results by 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he was in his car and waiting with his phone to \"see if this was a real thing.\"",
      "\"Sure enough, around 1:50 [p.m.] Eastern time, I see that Yemen is under attack,\" he said.",
      "When the attacks seemed to be \"going well,\" Goldberg told ABC News that members of the chat began sending congratulatory messages along with fist, fire and American flag emojis.",
      "\"That was the day I realized this is possibly unbelievably the leaders of the United States discussing this on my messaging app,\" Goldberg told ABC News. \"My reaction was, I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system.\"",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he removed himself from the group chat once the operation was completed.",
      "\"I watched this Yemen operation go from beginning to apparent end, and that was enough for me to learn that there's something wrong in the system here that would allow this information to come so dangerously close to the open wild,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waltz appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" the day after the strikes on Yemen and said the U.S. airstrikes \"took out\" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, which he said differed from the Biden administration's launches against the group.",
      "\"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth \u2014 what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" Waltz said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Goldberg published a story in The Atlantic revealing the mishap, in a piece titled \"The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.\"",
      "Shortly after the story's publication on Monday afternoon, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes shared with ABC News the statement he provided to The Atlantic confirming the authenticity of the Signal group chat.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Hegseth denied he sent war plans in the chat.",
      "\"I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth told reporters in Honolulu while on a layover on his trip to Asia.",
      "Hegseth called Goldberg a \"deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.\"",
      "\"This is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does,\" Hegseth said about Goldberg.",
      "During an event at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump was asked about Goldberg's article. \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic,\" he said.",
      "Top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries voiced outrage at the administration after this mishap.",
      "\"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,\" Jeffries said in a statement on Monday.",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who faced scrutiny over her alleged use of a private email server while at the State Department, shared her reaction to the Signal group chat on X: \"You have got to be kidding me.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also criticized this apparent breach of military intelligence, urging Senate Republicans to work with Democrats in a \"full investigation\" to look into how this incident occurred.",
      "\"If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, referencing the scandal over Clinton's emails.",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Goldberg is \"well-known for his sensationalist spin\" and emphasized that \"no 'war plans' were discussed.\"",
      "\"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread. Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,\" Leavitt shared on X.",
      "Trump told NBC News he remains confident in Waltz even after the use of an unsecured group chat.",
      "\"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,\" Trump told NBC correspondent Garrett Haake.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Tuesday regarding the mishap. Both officials said while testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence there was no classified information on the chain.",
      "Ratcliffe said he believed the \"national security adviser intended this to be as it should have been, a mechanism for coordinating between senior level officials, but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications for anything that would be classified.\"",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson continued to downplay the mishap but admitted the breach was a \"serious\" mistake on Tuesday.",
      "\"Look, they have acknowledged that there is an error, and they are correcting it. And I would've asked the same thing of the Biden administration,\" Johnson said during a news conference Tuesday morning.",
      "During a White House meeting with ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said this incident is \"just something that can happen\" and that there was \"no classified information\" in the group chat.",

      "\"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger,\" Waltz said.",

      "President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Social Security Administration on Tuesday distanced himself from some of the actions taken at the agency by officials linked to Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Frank Bisignano, a veteran Wall Street executive and GOP donor tapped to lead the agency delivering $1.5 trillion annually to more than 70 million people, told the Senate Finance Committee when asked about DOGE's work on agency systems and databases that he will conduct a \"total review\" of the activities at the SSA if he is confirmed.",

      "But under questioning from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Bisignano admitted he had been in communication with Mike Russo, an agency official now serving as chief information officer, and said they knew each other from the private sector.

      "Bisignano, currently the CEO of Fiserv, a financial data and payment company, argued his private sector experience will allow him to improve the quality and speed of the agency's service to the public.",
      "He called Social Security \"the most bipartisan thing we have\" and denied that he has \"thought about\" privatizing the agency.",
      "\"It's not a word that anybody's ever talked to me about, and I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that gets run for the benefit of the American public,\" he told Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.",
      "Democrats have repeatedly suggested the Trump administration's actions toward the agency, such as designating field offices for closure, firing staffers and requiring people to show up at a field office to verify their identities, instead of doing so over the phone, are meant to \"hollow out\" the SSA.",
      "\"This approach is a prelude to privatizing Social Security and handing it over to private equity,\" Wyden said.",
      "Democrats also challenged Bisignano on Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's comments on a podcast last week in which the billionaire said his mother-in-law wouldn't care about missing a payment from the agency and that only people committing fraud complain about services.",
      "\"I don't think anyone would appreciate not getting their Social Security check on time,\" Bisignano said.",
      "\"So they're not fraudsters?\" asked Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.",
      "\"It would be hard to get to that conclusion,\" he replied.",

    "story": [
      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has vetoed a bill touted by its Republican supporters as an attempt to bring clarity to the state's near-total abortion ban",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- A Republican-backed bill touted as an attempt to bring clarity to Kentucky's near-total abortion ban was vetoed Tuesday by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who said it would do the opposite by undermining the judgment of doctors while further imperiling the lives of pregnant women in emergency situations.",
      "Beshear, an abortion-rights supporter who is seen as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028, followed the advice of abortion-rights supporters who urged the governor to reject the measure.",
      "Kentucky\u2019s GOP supermajority legislature will have a chance to override Beshear\u2019s veto when lawmakers reconvene Thursday for the final two days of this year\u2019s 30-day session.",
      "The bill's supporters said it's meant to offer clarity to doctors now fearful of breaking Kentucky law for terminating pregnancies while treating expectant mothers with grave complications. Delving into potential life-or-death situations, the bill aims to provide clear guidelines for doctors in such emergencies while maintaining Kentucky\u2019s strict prohibitions against abortion, supporters said.",
      "\u201cAlthough supporters of House Bill 90 claim it protects pregnant women and clarifies abortion law in Kentucky, it actually does the opposite,\u201d Beshear said in his veto message Tuesday evening.",
      "The governor said the bill would block access to health care and put the lives of women facing crisis pregnancies at even more risk.",
      "Kentucky\u2019s near-total abortion ban has been in place since a so-called trigger law took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Bluegrass State bans abortions except when carried out to save a mother\u2019s life. Efforts to add exceptions for cases of rape or incest or when pregnancies are nonviable have made no headway in Kentucky\u2019s legislature.",
      "The new legislation would create a list of emergency situations in which abortions could be done to save the mother's life, but Beshear said it was flawed.",
      "\u201cThe bill is silent on any other emergency situations,\u201d the governor said in his message. \u201cNo one, including legislators, can possibly create an exhaustive list of emergency situations that may occur in a hospital or medical facility. Gaps in the law are literally a matter of life and death.\u201d",
      "A House Republican spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce abortion bans, exceptions have been a legal and political battleground.",
      "The Kentucky bill says doctors exercising reasonable medical judgment may take action \u201cseparating a pregnant woman from her unborn child\u201d in such cases as: lifesaving miscarriage management; emergency intervention for sepsis and hemorrhaging; procedures necessary to prevent the death or substantial risk of death of the pregnant woman; removal of an ectopic pregnancy; treatment of a molar pregnancy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be an exhaustive list but it is the most common issues that physicians and mothers, who are facing a crisis pregnancy, are facing,\u201d Republican state Rep. Kimberly Poore Moser said during a House debate on the measure.",
      "In touting the bill, GOP state Rep. Jason Nemes said it would ensure that women \"facing life-threatening situations receive timely, appropriate medical care, and gives providers the legal certainty they need to act decisively.\u201d",
      "Beshear faulted the bill for not containing language used by medical professionals.",
      "\u201cIt also substitutes a physician's best clinical judgment with an ambiguous, unworkable \u2018reasonable medical judgment\u2019 standard that will make doctors hesitant to provide life-saving care for fear someone other than the treating doctor, like a prosecutor or a court, may after the fact find it \u2018unreasonable,\u2019\u201d Beshear said. \u201cThese barriers to treatment could delay access to evidence-based and lifesaving care.\u201d",
      "Addia Wuchner, executive director of Kentucky Right to Life, was among the bill\u2019s advocates, telling a legislative panel: \u201cThis is medical care that needs to take place in the commonwealth.\u201d",
      "David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a socially conservative group, said the veto showed that Beshear is a \u201cmouthpiece\u201d for abortion-rights groups. Walls called it \u201cpro-mom and pro-baby\u201d bill meant to add clarity to Kentucky law to protect maternal health.",
      "Abortion-rights supporter Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky State director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said Beshear \u201cput patients over politics\u201d with his veto.",
      "\u201cHB 90 was never about clarity or compassion,\" she said in a statement. \u201cIt ignored medical standards, used anti-abortion rhetoric like \u2018maternal-fetal separation\u2019 and would have forced doctors to delay care during medical emergencies.\u201d",

      "While many of the cases are still working their way through the system, several federal judges have been swift in issuing temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, questioning the legality and constitutionality of President Donald Trump's actions.",
      "The president and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has been at the center of some of the suits, have dismissed many of the orders in interviews and on social media. Musk has called for the impeachment of multiple judges, and Trump has also called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "Boasberg has called on the administration to stop deporting Venezuelans as part of Trump's executive order that invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority used to deport noncitizens with little to no due process, as a lawsuit plays out.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Justice Department on behalf of five Venezuelans contending the deportees were not criminals. The judge argued that the accused deportees could face real harm and granted the TRO.",

      "Here are some of the major rulings issued by judges against the administration.",
      "March 21",
      "Boasberg said during a court hearing over the AEA deportations of Venezuelan migrants to an El Salvadorian prison that the administration's use of the law was \"incredibly troublesome and problematic.\"",
      "\"I agree it's an unprecedented and expanded use of an act that has been used \u2026 in the War of 1812, World War I and World War II, when there was no question there was a declaration of war and who the enemy was,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The judge noted that the Trump administration's arguments about the extent of the president's power are \"awfully frightening\" and a \"long way from\" the intent of the law.",
      "The Trump administration argued that members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the gang's national security risk warranted the use of the 18th century act.",
      "Boasberg vowed to hold the Trump administration accountable, if necessary, if it violated his court order from March 15.",
      "\"The government's not being terribly cooperative at this point, but I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my word and who ordered this and what's the consequence,\" he said.",
      "Boasberg also grilled Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign over his compliance with the court order to turn back the flights already in the air and questioned how the deportation flights were put together.",
      "\"Why is this proclamation essentially signed in the dark on Friday night, early Saturday morning, when people [were] rushed on the plane?\" Boasberg asked. \"To me, the only reason to do that is if you know the problem and you want to get them out of the country before a suit is filed.\"",
      "\"I don't have knowledge of those operational details,\" Ensign said.",
      "Boasberg also raised concerns that the rapid nature of the deportations prevented the men from being able to challenge the allegations that they belonged to Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"[What] they're simply saying is don't remove me, particularly to a country that's going to torture me,\" Boasberg said.",
      "An attorney for the ACLU argued that those targeted by the AEA should be able to contest whether they fall within the act.",
      "\"Otherwise, anybody could be taken off the street and removed,\" said Lee Gelernt, the attorney for the ACLU. \"This is a very dangerous road we're going down.\"",
      "As Ensign appeared to undermine arguments made earlier in the week about the timing of the order and struggled to answer Boasberg's questions, the judge suggested the Department of Justice might be risking its reputation and credibility.",
      "\"I often tell my clerks before they go out into the world to practice law, the most valuable treasure they possess is their reputation and their credibility,\" Boasberg said. \"I just ask you make sure your team [understands] that lesson.\"",
      "Boasberg decided on March 24 that the men who were deported were entitled to due process in court.",
      "\"Federal courts are equipped to adjudicate that question when individuals threatened with detention and removal challenge their designation as such. Because the named Plaintiffs dispute that they are members of Tren de Aragua, they may not be deported until a court has been able to decide the merits of their challenge,\" he wrote.",

It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,\" she wrote.",
      "\"The government has not even attempted to explain why a more tailored, measured, titrated approach is not suitable to the task,\" Hollander added. \"Instead, the government simply repeats its incantation of a need to modernize the system and uncover fraud.

      "Khalil and the others said the Republican-controlled committee's request for their records violates the First Amendment and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and made Columbia \"feel pressure to cooperate with the government in its efforts to chill and punish protected speech.\"",

    "story": [
      "As Republicans pull back from in-person events, Democrats step into the void.",
      "BETHLEHEM, Pa. -- At a \"People's Town Hall\" on Thursday held by the Democratic National Committee, in a church located in a Pennsylvania district that Democrats lost to Republicans in 2024, party leaders fired up the crowd when slamming the White House and congressional Republicans over Medicaid, federal government cuts, and other issues.",
      "Town halls are among the strategies that Democrats are using to try to get their base fired up against the Trump White House -- but attendees there and at other events say they're still looking for the Democratic Party to take on Republicans more directly.",
      "DNC chair Ken Martin, speaking at the Bethlehem event, called President Donald Trump and key adviser Elon Musk \"cowards,\" riling up the crowd by framing the work of the duo in stark terms.",
      "\"There's nothing moral about what these cowards are doing, and there's nothing moral about what we saw today in Washington, D.C., as Donald Musk -- Donald Trump and his president, President Musk, decided to do, signing that executive order eliminating the Department of Education, which is going to have a disproportionate impact on the disabled community and so many children throughout this country,\" Martin told the crowd, amidst boos towards Trump and Musk.",
      "And Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who received among the loudest applause of any of the panelists, took a starker tone: \"Don't let anybody tell you that we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Raskin said.",
      "\"Because that is too passive-sounding. That's too ambiguous. This is an attack on the Constitution of the United States, and we're going to defend the Constitution of the United States!\"",
      "Republicans face fierce pushback at in-person events",
      "The Democratic Party claims that it's holding these town halls as a way to hear directly from voters.",
      "\"The purpose of these town halls is not for us to spread our message, but us to hear from people throughout this country right now who are facing deep and serious impacts to their own lives, to their neighborhoods and communities, because of what this administration is doing,\" Martin told ABC News on Thursday after the town hall.",
      "But Martin and others, explicitly, are also emphasizing the idea that Democrats are showing up and hosting these events while Republicans are pulling back from hosting in-person events or facing fierce pushback from constituents when they do. Some of the loudest applause in the church on Thursday came when speakers criticized the district's representative, Ryan Mackenzie -- who in 2024 narrowly flipped the seat held by Democrat Susan Wild.",
      "Arnaud Armstrong, a spokesman for Mackenzie, told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday that Mackenzie has answered questions at in-person events and would run a telephone town hall on Thursday night to allow for more people to speak with the congressman, including people with disabilities or seniors who might struggle to make it to an in-person event.",
      "During that telephone town hall, Mackenzie said, \"This is the best way that I have found to reach literally thousands of people at once and be able to have this kind of conversation.\"",
      "Disillusioned Democrats",
      "The town halls come as Democratic voters show disillusion with their party.",
      "A recent CNN/SSRS poll taken in early March found that 52% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents felt that the leadership of the Democrats is taking the party in the wrong direction, and that 57% felt that the party should mainly work to \"stop the Republican agenda.\"",
      "While waiting in line outside to enter the town hall, some residents of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley region told ABC News that President Donald Trump's actions struck close to home or worried them -- but that they felt disillusioned with the broader Democratic response so far.",
      "'Very mixed feelings' on Democrats' response to Trump",
      "Carole Ostfeld, a retired teacher from Allentown, Pennsylvania, came bearing a sign that said \"Hands off Medicaid.\" She and her husband David told ABC News that they came out to the town hall in order to protest Trump and Musk, including because of Trump's actions with the Department of Education.",
      "But asked how they feel about the Democratic response to the Trump administration, Carole Ostfeld said, \"I've got very mixed feelings --\"",
      "Her husband added, \"It needs to be more.\"",
      "Asked if Democrats' messaging is resonating with them, Carole Ostfeld said it is -- but, \"as they say, you can't fight city hall,\" as Republicans are in power.",
      "Another attendee, Ann Frechette of Easton, Pennsylvania, said the news about Trump signing an order to dismantle the Department of Education, which came that day, struck close to home. \"I have a son in college who benefits from a Pell Grant,\" she told ABC News. \"And I'm afraid that that Pell Grant will disappear, that monies like that will disappear. He's on Medicaid, I think he may lose his health insurance. There's so many things.\"",
      "But the broader Democratic response was disillusioning her as well. While she praised some individual lawmakers, including Raskin, she added, \"I think the Democrats in general, they don't -- I'm a Democrat, but my party doesn't seem to get the message that was delivered last November. I would like people to stand up to what is being done.\"",
      "Firing up supporters",
      "That said, the town hall itself was by many measures a success -- or at least, the Democratic speakers were able to fire up their supporters.",
      "All of the pews were filled, with some attendees standing on the back or the sides of the sanctuary; and the crowd gave thunderous standing ovations to the speakers multiple times \u2013 particularly when, for instance, Raskin spoke about taking on Trump or former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild criticized the incumbent representative.",
      "People paid attention as audience members shared their own stories and questions, and then applauded them warmly, cheering on their peers in a clear show of support.",
      "During a question and answer portion of the town hall, attendees raised concerns about the future of Medicaid, educational programs, and other issues.",
      "Another attendee, Terri Neifert, told the crowd that she has lived in Bethlehem almost her entire life and became disabled after a fall at a grocery store, which changed the trajectory of her life. She said she managed to get her degree and to support her family through Medicare, food banks, and Social Security disability.",
      "\"If they cut Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps\u2026 I would lose everything,\" Neifert told the crowd.",
      "Neifert received a round of applause from the audience, and other attendees went up to her after the event wrapped to thank her for sharing her story.",
      "Asked by ABC News after the town hall how she was feeling by then about the Democrats' response to the Trump administration, Neifert -- similar to other attendees -- focused on the road ahead.",
      "\"It looks like it's gonna be a fight, and an uphill battle... more public outcry, more marches, and Congress needs to pull up their big boy pants and start doing their job,\" Neifert said.",
      "Going on the road",
      "Some Democrats or Democratic-aligned allies are taking a different tack than the town halls -- and going on the road.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been on the road for weeks with what he calls the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, making stops for rallies in both right- and left-leaning districts. The Democratic Party has shown support for his efforts, reposting social media posts from Sanders about the tour.",
      "Out there on Sanders' tour, some attendees said they're disillusioned with the party's response to Trump.",
      "\"They gotta be a little tougher,\" one rally attendee told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl at the Denver event. Another was blunter: \"Quit being a bunch of doormats.\"",
      "But -- in a sign that the rallies may be a successful tactic for Democrats to reach their base -- they're attracting thousands of people. Sander's Denver appearance, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., brought in more than 30,000 attendees.",
      "Sanders said it was the largest rally he's ever hosted -- bigger than the rallies on his two presidential runs.",
      "Sanders himself has his own criticism for the Democratic Party, telling Karl in an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" that the Democrats should have done more for working people when they had control of the Senate.",
      "\"And since then, do I think the Democrats have been effective in rallying the American people, in stopping Trump's movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism? No, I don't,\" Sanders told Karl.",
      "Donna Brazile, a former DNC chair and an ABC News contributor, said on \"This Week\" after Sanders' interview, said, \"Bernie Sanders is filling a void, a major void left after, of course, the defeat of Kamala Harris last year by Donald Trump. This void has to be filled because there's so much anger, anger not just in red districts, but also in blue districts.\"",
      "That void is one that Democrats hope to fill with these events.",
      "Martin, asked by ABC News after the Bethlehem town hall if he thought the messages of the Democrats is going to resonate in Republican districts or with Democrats themselves, said that wasn't really the point.",
      "\"It's really not about the message resonating,\" Martin said. \"What this is about is listening to people. Hearing the concerns of Americans right now throughout this country, who deserve to be heard, right?\"",
      "Martin added later: \"We're going to fill a void for them, and we're going to talk to more people throughout this country.\"",

Photojournalist Philip Holsinger documented their arrival, telling ABC News about capturing the images for Time magazine.",
      "\"I don't think they were ready for what they saw,\" Holsinger said. \"It's a major military operation where they bring the police and the military together for security purposes and surround the planes. And to put these guys, it takes about 22 buses for this amount of people to transport them to their supermax prison.\"",

      "\"By the end of the night, there was nobody that was defiant,\" he said \"I mean, the whole process of the intake is so aggressive -- for security reasons, you know, the security forces will tell you -- but it's still, it's very forceful.\"",
      "According to Holsinger, the detainees arrived in the Central American nation on commercial charter flights rather than military aircraft, so there was no way to chain anyone to a seat.",
      "\"They are shackled in a, you know, a typical shackling of ankles, wrists, and then connected by one chain,\" Holsinger said. \"And you know, they're guarded by special operations from Homeland Security that's on the plane.\"",

Those people on those plans on that Saturday had no opportunity to file habeas [corpus] or any type of action to challenge the removal.\"",

      "But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.",
      "U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Br\u00f6sche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries.

      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",

Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",
      "\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff's 90-day tourist permit.",

      "\u201cEnglish is not Lucas' first language and so he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Las Vegas,' and the agent says, \u2019Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can't do that,'\" Tyler said, recounting what happened.",
      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",

      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.",

Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.",
      "Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's \u201cno connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.",
      "Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn't entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.",
      "Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.",
      "But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans\u2019 frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.",
      "Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.",
      "Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.",
      "If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.",
      "Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren't enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington D",
      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.",
      "For now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong \u2014 a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.",
      "That's something Waymo already has been doing since it began sending out its robotaxis in Washington in late January after a brief trial run in the capital last year.",
      "While the robotaxis continue to learn their way around the city, Waymo executives expressed confidence they will be able to work with regulators to clear the way for completely driverless rides at some point next year through its Waymo One app.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring the comfort, consistency, and safety of Waymo One to Washingtonians, those who work and play in the city every day, and the millions of people from around the world who travel to the District every year,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana.",
      "If Waymo's ambitions pan out, Washington and Miami next year will be added to four other U.S. markets where its robotaxis are transporting passengers \u2014 Phoenix, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Waymo and Uber also are teaming up to begin dispatching its robotaxis in Atlanta later this year.",
      "The growth has helped turn what began as a head-turning novelty in Phoenix and then in San Francisco into an increasingly common sight in the cities where Waymo operates. The company says it had provided more than 4 million driverless rides to paying customers through the end of this year, and is now providing them at a pace of 200,000 paid trips per week.",
      "That has established Waymo as the early frontrunner in driverless technology while others are racing to catch up. Both Amazon and Tesla are gearing up to launch their own services in different U.S. cities while another ride-hailing service, Lyft, has announced plans to add robotaxis as an option in Atlanta and Dallas.",
      "Waymo's early lead in the still-nascent robotaxi market is a vindication of a technology that began as a secret project within Google in 2009 before it was spun off into a separate company owned by Alphabet Inc. in 2016.",

      "Legislative leaders from both parties will decide how to replace the painting that Trump derided Sunday night on social media and that by Tuesday morning had been taken down.",
      "When they will meet about a new painting is anyone's guess. The Legislature is focused on more pressing matters including the state budget.",

      "Bly also said no one knows yet whether Trump will get to approve a new portrait.",
      "Colorado Republicans raised more than $10,000 to commission the Trump painting that had been in the state Capitol since 2019, alongside other U.S. presidents.",
      "Sometime late Monday or early Tuesday, the Trump portrait by Colorado Springs artist Sarah Boardman was removed and put in storage with History Colorado, overseer of a state museum in Denver. It is unlikely to be displayed elsewhere, Bly said.",
      "The move came at the request of Colorado Republicans after Trump claimed the artist had \u201cpurposefully distorted\u201d him. He praised the portrait of Barack Obama, painted by the same artist.",
      "On Tuesday, school groups and tourists filed past the wall where Trump's portrait once hung. Picture hooks and a plate reading \u201cDonald Trump \u2014 45th and 47th President \u2014 2017-2021 and 2025-2029\u201d remained. Some visitors stopped to take photos.",
      "It's not the first time that Trump's attention has turned to Colorado, which has shifted from leaning red to leaning blue over the past two decades.",
      "He criticized the Colorado Supreme Court in 2023 for declaring he was ineligible for the White House and could not appear on the state ballot because of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection. While campaigning last year, Trump made the Denver suburb of Aurora a focus of his illegal immigration message.",
      "Before his portrait was installed, a prankster placed a picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin near the spot intended for Trump.",
      "Boardman did not return phone and email messages seeking comment. In 2019, she said painted him with a \u201cnonconfrontational\u201d and \u201cthoughtful\u201d expression, drawing criticism from those who said that's not who he really is. She said her portraits of Trump and Obama were not political statements.",

      "The top U.N. official in South Sudan is warning that the country is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top U.N. official in the world\u2019s youngest nation warned on Monday, lamenting the government\u2019s sudden postponement of the latest peace effort.",
      "Calling the situation unfolding in the country \u201cdire,\u201d Nicholas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage \u201cand put the interests of their people ahead of their own.\u201d",
      "There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 \u2014 and again until 2026.",
      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country\u2019s north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar\u2019s home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.",
      "Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating \u201cparticularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.\u201d",
      "He said Kiir and Machar don\u2019t trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.",
      "\u201cRampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\u201d Haysom said.",
      "\u201cGiven this grim situation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.\u201d",
      "Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.",
      "He said the U.N. takes the threat of the \u201cethnic transformation\u201d of the conflict very seriously.",
      "To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.",
      "Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions \u201cthrough dialogue rather than military confrontation.\u201d",

      "Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin\u2019s pivotal Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin's pivotal state Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago, the latest sign of the intense interest in a contest that has obliterated spending records and drawn attention from President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser, Elon Musk.",
      "As of Tuesday, with just a week to go until the final day of voting, nearly 48% more early ballots have been cast compared with the same point two years ago, according to data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. More than 345,000 voters had returned ballots, either by mail or in person, compared with about 233,000 at this point two years ago during another race for a Supreme Court seat.",
      "The election will determine whether the court will remain under 4-3 liberal control or flip to a conservative majority. One of the current liberal justices is retiring.",
      "This year's race has morphed into a proxy battle over the nation\u2019s politics, with Trump and Musk getting behind Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate in a race that is officially nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cAll Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post late last week.",
      "Total spending on the race has reached more than $73 million, including more than $14 million by groups funded by Musk, according to a tally Monday by the Brennan Center for Justice. That's the most on record for any U.S. judicial race, breaking the $56 million spent on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court contest in 2023, when majority control also was on the line.",
      "All that spending and attention has helped fuel early voting, said Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin's former top elections official who now works as a consultant. He spoke while taking a break from working at a Madison poll site where people could vote early.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of money being invested,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cEverything seems to be focused on, \u2018Let\u2019s get out the vote.\u2019\u201d",
      "After previously being critical of early voting, Trump and the Republican Party are urging their supporters to cast their ballots before the final day of voting on April 1. Early voting ends Sunday. The strategy, which they deployed with great success in last year's presidential race, appears to be contributing to large turnout increases in more conservative counties across Wisconsin.",
      "Schimel's opponent, Democratic-backed Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, has raised more than $25 million for the race to date, including $5.5 million from the state Democratic Party since early February. Her supporters include billionaire Democratic megadonor George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, had raised more than $12 million, which includes more than $6 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party since early February.",
      "But outside groups have more than made up the difference in what the candidates have raised.",
      "The roughly $28 million spent by the candidates as of Monday was far exceeded by the roughly $45 million spent so far by outside groups, according to the Brennan Center calculation. Schimel and his allies, which include groups backed by Musk, have spent about $41 million, while Crawford and her supporters have spent about $32 million.",
      "Voters in Wisconsin do not register by political party, so it's impossible to know how many of the ballots already submitted came from Republicans or Democrats. But the data shows that the largest increases are coming from both Democratic- and Republican-heavy counties.",
      "Milwaukee County, the state's largest county and the one that is home to the most Democrats, led all counties in ballots returned with 54,750. That is more than 46% ahead of this point two years ago. Liberal Dane County, the state's second largest county and home to the state capital of Madison and the University of Wisconsin, has also seen a 46% increase.",
      "But Republican parts of the state also have seen big jumps.",
      "Voting was up in the three suburban Milwaukee counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, which are commonly referred to as the WOW counties. Ballot returns were up more than 62% in Waukesha and 51% in Ozaukee. In Washington, the most heavily Republican of the three counties, early voting was more than double two years ago.",
      "In Brown County, the state's fourth most populous one, which is reliably Republican, early turnout was up more than 34%.",
      "While the early voting is high for a spring election, it's far from what battleground Wisconsin saw at this point before the presidential race. A week before the Nov. 5 election, nearly 1 million voters had cast their ballots, almost four times as many as in this race to date.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules.",
      "On Monday night, Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told supporters that electing Crawford was important so she and other liberal justices can order a redraw of congressional boundary lines. Even though Wisconsin is a swing state, Republican-drawn lines have allowed the party to hold six of its eight congressional seats.",
      "\u201cAs soon as possible, we need to be able to revisit that and have fair lines,\u201d Jeffries said in a live discussion on the social media platform X. \u201cThe only way for that to be even a significant possibility is if you have an enlightened Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Schimel has accused Crawford of promising to Democrats that she will redraw the lines. Crawford has denied that.",

      "In a second legislative special election Tuesday, in a suburban and farming part of Lancaster County, Democrat James Andrew Malone, the mayor of 4,500-population East Petersburg, was clinging to a narrow lead over Republican Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons. A Democratic flip of that district, if it occurs, would be a major upset but would not alter Republican control of the state Senate.",
      "As of late Tuesday, the race was too early to call. With 99% of the estimated vote counted, Malone led Parsons by 482 votes, or 0.89% of nearly 54,000 ballots cast, with an unknown number of provisional ballots left to be counted.",

Josh Shapiro, a rising star among Democrats who is seen as a potential 2028 presidential candidate. The partisan divide and power sharing in Harrisburg \u2014 a dynamic that has prevailed for much of the past two decades \u2014 has prevented major changes in state law.",
      "After the House race was called, Goughnour said, \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, but I feel good.\u201d He said his goal was to \u201cmaintain common sense in Harrisburg\u201d and give his district a strong voice.",
      "\u201cWe knocked on thousands and thousands of doors,\u201d Goughnour said. \u201cWe worked hard and didn\u2019t take anything for granted.\u201d",
      "Goughnour\u2019s victory means Democrats control the House by a single representative, 102 to 101. The party will be able to keep Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia as the chamber\u2019s presiding officer.",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement that the majority means state House Democrats \u201ccan stand up to Trump\u2019s mayhem in Washington,\u201d prevent efforts to weaken Shapiro's authority and \u201ccontinue to expand job opportunities, strengthen schools and create safe communities in Pennsylvania.\u201d",
      "The Senate vacancy in northern Lancaster County was created when Sen. Ryan Aument, a Republican, quit to take a job working for U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick. Malone and the Democrats built on a strong advantage in mail-in ballots to combat the Republicans' significant voter registration edge.",
      "On his way to narrowly winning Pennsylvania in November, President Donald Trump received 57% of the district vote, while McCormick, a Republican, received 56% in the district as he beat Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey. Aument ran unopposed in his last election in 2022.",

      "Goughnour, the winner of the House race, will be resigning as a detective supervisor after spending well over a decade as a police officer in McKeesport.

      "FBI Director Kash Patel, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, are among the witnesses who will appear Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee and Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "Tuesday's hearing will take place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Trump administration, including Ratcliffe and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.",
      "The annual hearings on worldwide threats will offer a glimpse of the Trump administration's reorienting of priorities, which officials across agencies have described as countering the scourge of fentanyl and fighting violent crime, human trafficking and illegal immigration.",
      "Former FBI Director Christopher Wray routinely has said he is hard-pressed to think of a time in his career when the United States faced so many elevated threats at once, but the concerns he more regularly highlighted had to do with sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism.",
      "\u201cWe have to change to the dynamic threat landscape that is changing constantly not just in America but abroad,\u201d Patel said in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday night, citing the elevated threat from \u201cnarco-traffickers.\" But, he added, \u201cwe're not going to forget or ignore national security \u2014 never.\u201d",
      "The hearings are also unfolding against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine.",
      "Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with President Donald Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a \u201cmovement to peace.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack at an El Paso Walmart in 2019 in one of the the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history has been offered a plea deal to avoid the death penalty",
      "The gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart near the U.S.-Mexico border in 2019 would avoid the death penalty under a plea offer announced Tuesday, abruptly ending years of efforts by prosecutors to see that he face execution by lethal injection.",
      "El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya said during a news conference that his decision in the prosecution of Patrick Crusius, who drove across the state for one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history and posted a racist screed just before opening fire, was driven by a majority of victims' relatives who wanted the case behind them.",
      "\u201cThis is about allowing the families of the 23 victims who lost their lives on that horrific day \u2014 and the 22 wounded \u2014 to finally have resolution in our court system,\u201d Montoya said in a statement.",
      "\u201cNow, no one in this community will ever have to hear the perpetrator\u2019s name ever again,\u201d he added. \u201cNo more hearings. No more appeals. He will die in prison.\u201d",
      "But Montoya also acknowledged at the news conference that not all families agreed with the reversal by his office, which under previous leadership had committed to taking the case to trial and seeking the death penalty.",
      "Adria Gonzalez, a survivor who helped panicked shoppers toward exits, said she feels that not pursuing the death penalty is \u201ca slap in the face for all the victims.\u201d",
      "Under the offer, Montoya said, Crusius would plead guilty to capital murder and receive life in prison with no possibility of parole. The plea hearing and sentencing is set for April 21, Montoya said, and families will be able to give victim impact statements.",
      "Mark Stevens, an attorney for Crusius, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Crusius, 26, was already sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences at the federal level after pleading guilty in 2023 to hate crime charges. Under the Biden administration, federal prosecutors also took the death penalty off the table.",
      "Montoya said he supports the death penalty and believes Crusius deserves it. But he said he met with the families of the victims and while some were willing to wait as long as it took for a death sentence, there was an overriding desire to conclude the process.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over,\u201d said Elise Hoffmann-Taus, whose father, Alexander Hoffmann was among those killed. \u201cThis is the outcome I wanted.\u201d",
      "Montoya, a Democrat who took office in January after defeating a Republican incumbent appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, is the fourth district attorney to oversee the case.",
      "His predecessor, Bill Hicks, said following the announcement that while he had been ready to take the case to trial and pursue the death penalty, he could not fault Montoya\u2019s reasoning behind the plea offer.",
      "\u201cIt is not the reasoning I would have followed,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cI know that it was very hard for him, and I respect that it was a very difficult decision.\u201d",
      "Crusius, who is white, was 21 years old and had dropped out of community college when police say he drove more than 700 miles (1,100 kilometers) from his home near Dallas to El Paso.",
      "Moments after posting online his racist rant, which warned of a Hispanic \u201cinvasion\u201d of the state, he opened fire with an AK-style rifle inside and outside the store.",
      "Crusius was arrested shortly after the shooting and confessed to officers who stopped him at an intersection, police have said.",
      "Prior to the attack, Crusius appears to have been consumed by the immigration debate, posting online in support of building the border wall and other messages praising the hard-line border policies of President Donald Trump, who was in his first term at the time. He went further in the screed right before the shootings, saying Hispanics were going to take over the government and economy.",
      "In the federal case, prosecutors did not formally explain their decision not to seek the death penalty, but they did acknowledge that Crusius suffered from schizoaffective disorder, which can be marked by hallucinations, delusions and mood swings.",
      "Abbott, a Republican, said Tuesday after the announcement that he thought Crusius deserved to die: \u201cAny shooting like that is what capital punishment is for.\u201d",
      "The people who were killed ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to several grandparents. They included immigrants, a retired city bus driver, teachers, tradesmen including a former iron worker, and several Mexican nationals who had crossed the U.S. border on routine shopping trips.",
      "In 2023, Crusius agreed to pay more than $5 million to his victims. Court records showed that his attorneys and the Justice Department reached an agreement over the restitution amount, which was then approved by a U.S. district judge. There was no indication that he had significant assets.",

      "Dozens of bird eggs and chicks were rescued from nests in a single wind-damaged eucalyptus tree that was dangerously close to collapsing in a California park.",
      "Now staff at the International Bird Rescue\u2019s Los Angeles Wildlife Center have been working around the clock to care for the 47 eggs and 12 chicks, all double-crested Cormorants, in hopes that they will be able to be released back into the wild in a few months.",
      "The tree at a park in Marina del Rey was flagged earlier this month after one of its trunks fell and crushed a trash bin enclosure, explained Nicole Mooradian, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches & Harbors. Its other trunk was showing signs of collapsing as well, threatening not only the birds but anyone on the nearby public walkway or in the parking lot next door.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a question of if this tree is going to fail, it was more of a when,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cThe cracks were growing wider by the day. It was really bad.\u201d",
      "For at least five hours on March 10, tree contractors meticulously removed each of the 20 nests and chopped off branches one at a time. Biologists on the ground put the eggs and hatchlings in egg cartons and boxes with heated blankets acting as temporary incubators.",
      "Double-crested Cormorants are common in Southern California and tend to nest in large colonies that may crowd a single tree, explained Kylie Clatterbuck, wildlife center manager for the bird rescue. For about a month, Cormorant parents incubate the eggs and then give the chicks regurgitated food for several weeks.",
      "Taking care of them can be very difficult because when they hatch they are essentially \u201cnaked little balls of skin\u201d completely reliant on their parents, she said.",
      "At the rescue in San Pedro, the chicks must be fed every hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.. When staff interact with them, they wear a black suit and disguise their face, while using decoys and puppets to keep the birds from forming an attachment with them, which could make them too trusting of humans in the wild.",
      "Rescue staff expect the birds to stay for at least three months and then once they can hunt on their own and fly, they plan to release them into the wild.",
      "All of the chicks are healthy and happy, with some about 2 weeks old and already eating whole fish, said Clatterbuck.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard raising baby birds. We do our best; we do what we know; we treat what we know,\" she said. \u201cAnd we can only hope that they do a good job and they can survive.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina has accelerated significantly",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina accelerated significantly Tuesday as the Republican governor and leaders of the House and Senate came together to promise to pass an ambitious bill to charge one flat rate for all taxpayers.",
      "The details of the bill weren't released at a news conference, but every speaker made sure its goal was known \u2014 take the 6.2% top income tax rate down to 3.99% for everyone by the end of 2026.",
      "If the economy keeps growing and the tax base is increasing, the plan would cut $200 million from income taxes collected until that flat rate is 2.49%.",
      "Republican leadership also promised not to increase other taxes, such as those on sales and property, to offset income tax reductions, like other nearby states have done.",
      "South Carolina would be one of a number of states looking to find a way to cut taxes. Mississippi and Louisiana are considering a swap of sales taxes or gas taxes to offset revenue lost. There are proposals to cut taxes on tips or Social Security benefits in several states and Kentucky has already lowered its income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%.",
      "Mostly unsaid at the Statehouse news conference Tuesday was the exact mechanism to get from 6% to 3.99%, outside of a promise that everyone with taxable income would pay something.",
      "Now, some residents make more than $1 million but pay no South Carolina income tax, said Republican House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister.",
      "\u201cThere will be some people when we take away the gaming of the tax system \u2014 they will pay more. But we think 3.99% is a legitimately good fair tax to charge them,\u201d Bannister said.",
      "Figures from about five years ago when the income tax was first cut suggested about one-third of all people who filed a South Carolina income tax return paid nothing. Most of them were low-income residents.",
      "Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said it's only fair that even the lowest income earners pay something outside of sales tax and perhaps property tax.",
      "\u201cI look forward to a tax system in our state that is viewed as low, broad, fair, flat \u2014 doesn\u2019t take too much from anybody but everybody has to pay something, a little something, to be part of this great state of South Carolina,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "South Carolina can afford the income tax cut for now thanks to its booming economy and population, which has grown by 1.5 million people since 2000 to a total of 5.5 million residents. Many of them have been well-off retirees.",
      "The goal is to have one of the lowest income tax rates in the Southeast, lawmakers said. Bannister pointed out the 2.49% rate would be less than Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Alabama.",
      "South Carolina has less than two months left in the 2025 session to get the tax cut plan through the House and Senate and to the governor's desk. Legislative leaders said that can be done.",
      "No Democrats were seen among the several dozen lawmakers who flanked the governor and House and Senate leaders, although they have supported tax cuts before. They support the state's program to cut the top rate of 7% down to 6%, which should reach its goal next year.",

      "A law signed by Gov. JB Pritzker last week transferred Shabbona Lake State Recreation Area, 1,500 acres (607 hectares) in north-central Illinois.",
      "\u201cWe are proud to once again call this land home,\u201d said Joseph \u201cZeke\u201d Rupnick, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation based in Mayetta, Kansas.",
      "The action returns to the Potawatomi territory in the same area that was ceded to Chief Shab-eh-nay in a treaty with the U.S. government in 1829. Nothing ever altered that treaty, but when Shab-eh-nay and his people left for several years to visit family in Kansas, the government sold the land to white settlers.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely the same soil that the U.S. took from Chief Shab-eh-nay. The boundaries of his original 1,280-acre (518-hectare) reservation now encompass hundreds of acres of privately owned land, a golf course and county forest preserve. Returning the original land would undoubtedly put the transfer into an interminable legal wrangle.",
      "\u201cThis moment reflects the power of collaboration and the shared desire to build a future rooted in justice and respect,\" Rupnick said. \u201cIllinois has shown true courage and vision by leading the way in the Land Back movement, demonstrating that healing and reconciliation are possible.\u201d",
      "The land will stay open to the public as a park, with the state providing maintenance.",
      "Rupnick for years has traveled repeatedly from Kansas to Illinois to negotiate with local and state governments, provide equipment to help clean up after storms and speak with neighbors, many of whom fear changes will come to the park that will disrupt their lives. Rupnick told lawmakers last spring it made no sense to install a casino because of the number of state-sanctioned gambling houses in operation.",
      "He did not rule out constructing a hotel, however, noting that the park, 68 miles (109 kilometers) west of Chicago, has 150 campsites, draws 500,000 visitors a year, and the closest lodging is a 20-minute drive away.",

      "Col. James H. Harvey III, 101, is among the last few airmen and support crew who proved that a Black unit \u2014 the 332nd Fighter Group of the Tuskegee Airmen \u2014 could fight as well as any other in World War II and the years after.",
      "He went on to become the first Black jet fighter pilot in Korean airspace during the Korean War, and a decorated one after 126 missions. He was one of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the first U.S. Air Force Gunnery Meet in 1949, a forerunner of today\u2019s U.S. Navy \u201cTop Gun\u201d school.",
      "\u201cThey said we didn\u2019t have any ability to operate aircraft or operate heavy machinery. We were inferior to the white man. We were nothing,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cSo we showed them.\u201d",

      "The videos were shown to troops as part of DEI courses taken during basic military training. Some photos of Tuskegee Airmen were also among tens of thousands of images in a Pentagon database flagged for removal.",

      "The Tuskegee Airmen unit was established in 1941 as the 99th Pursuit Squadron based at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The 99th became the 332nd Fighter Group, which by war's end destroyed or damaged more than 400 enemy aircraft in North Africa and Europe during the war and sank a German destroyer in action.",
      "Of the 992 Tuskegee Airmen trained as pilots starting in 1942, 335 were deployed, 66 were killed in action and 32 who were shot down became war prisoners.",
      "In 1949, two months after the airmen's gunnery meet victory in the propeller-driven class, the U.S. Air Force integrated Black and white troops and the Tuskegee Airmen were absorbed into other units.",
      "It took the Air Force almost half a century to recognize 332nd's last achievement: Its success in aerial bombing and shooting proficiency in the gunnery meet at what is now Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.",
      "For decades, the winners were listed as \u201cunknown\u201d and their trophy was missing.",

      "Media outlets in Greenland and Denmark reported that Vance would be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz. The White House and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world\u2019s largest island, even as Denmark, a NATO ally, insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump's plans.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that Trump \u201cdoesn't care\u201d what the Europeans think.",
      "He said Denmark is \u201cnot doing its job\u201d with Greenland and \u201cnot being a good ally,\u201d and \u201cif that means that we need to take more territorial interest in Greenland that is what President Trump is going to do,\u201d Vance said on Fox News' \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d",
      "\"Because he doesn\u2019t care about what the Europeans scream at us, he cares about putting the interests of American citizens first,\" Vance said.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. will come to control Greenland while insisting he supports the idea for strategic national security reasons \u2014 not with an eye toward American expansionism.",
      "\u201cI think we will have it,\u201d Trump said of Greenland shortly after beginning his second term on Jan. 20. The U.S. already has a military base on Greenland and the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited it in January.",
      "On her visit, Usha Vance will attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland\u2019s national dogsled race, featuring about 37 mushers and 444 dogs. The statement said Vance and the U.S. delegation \u201care excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity.\u201d",
      "During a recent Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said \u201cDenmark\u2019s very far away\u201d from Greenland, and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world\u2019s largest island as part of its kingdom.",
      "\u201cA boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think it is, actually.\u201d",
      "All five parties in Greenland\u2019s parliament issued a joint statement last week rejecting Trump's remarks. Denmark has recognized Greenland\u2019s right to independence at a time of its choosing.",
      "Beyond his focus on Greenland, Trump has refused to rule out military intervention in Panama to retake that country's canal, said that Canada should be America's 51st state and suggested that U.S. interests could assume control of the war-torn Gaza Strip from Israel and redevelop it as a \u201cRiviera\u201d-like seaside resort.",

      "The election to fill a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat is quickly becoming a referendum on the Trump administration and a test of enthusiasm on both sides",
      "The election to fill a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat has become a referendum not only on the new administration, but on Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become one of President Donald Trump 's top financial backers and the architect of his efforts to slash the federal workforce.",
      "The April 1 election is the first major test in American politics since Trump secured a second term in November. It will serve as a crucial barometer of enthusiasm in both parties heading into next year's midterm elections and is happening in a critical battleground state that Trump won by less than a percentage point.",
      "It's also a test for Musk himself. The Tesla CEO's nascent political operation, which spent more than $200 million to help Trump win in November, is canvassing and advertising in Wisconsin on behalf of the conservative candidate. A win would cement his status as a conservative kingmaker, while a loss could give license to Republicans distancing themselves from his efforts to stymie government functions and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.",
      "\u201cThis is the first major election held since Donald Trump took office,\u201d said Anthony Chergosky, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. \u201cAnd I think notably Democrats are concentrating more on Elon Musk than Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Musk, who is the race's biggest donor by far, has also inserted himself into the race, holding a get-out-the-vote event on his X platform Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt might not seem important, but it\u2019s actually really important. And it could determine the fate of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election is going to affect everyone in the United States.\u201d",
      "April 1\u2019s election will determine majority control of a court facing critical issues: abortion rights, collective bargaining and voter access. They include decisions that could have major implications for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election, particularly if they end up hearing challenges to the state\u2019s congressional maps, which could theoretically swing the balance of power in Washington if they are considerably redrawn.",
      "In 2020, the court rejected Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his election loss in the battleground state in a 4-3 ruling. Trump had sought to have 221,000 ballots disqualified in the state\u2019s two most Democratic counties.",
      "The Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, but the campaign has been anything but. Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate, has openly courted Trump's endorsement, which he received on Friday night, as he campaigns against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democrat-backed candidate.",
      "The Waukesha County judge and former Republican attorney general attended the president\u2019s inauguration in January, has said that he would be part of a \u201csupport system\u201d for Trump. Earlier this month, he attended a \u201cMega MAGA rally\u201d where he posed for a picture in front of a giant inflatable version of the president, which had a \u201cVote Brad Schimel Supreme Court\u201d poster plastered on its chest.",
      "He spoke on Musk's get-out-the-vote call on Saturday. And he joined the president\u2019s eldest son on stage at a get-out-the-vote rally, where Donald Trump Jr. said a Schimel win would protect his father\u2019s agenda and keep up GOP momentum.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just show up when Trump\u2019s on the ticket,\u201d he said at a brewery in the Milwaukee suburbs. \u201cYou have to engage because it\u2019s not just about now, it\u2019s about that future. This presidency could be put to a halt with this vote.\u201d",
      "Schimel has also resurfaced long-debunked conspiracies about voter fraud that Trump has embraced, urging his supporters to vote early to \u201cmake this too big to rig so we don\u2019t have to worry that at 11:30 in Milwaukee, they\u2019re going to find bags of ballots that they forgot to put into the machines.\u201d",
      "Still, he pledged to judge any case that comes before him on its merits \u2014 including potential cases involving Trump and Musk.",
      "Republicans have cast the race as a chance for Trump\u2019s loyal supporters to rally around their leader and push back against liberal judges they accuse of working to stymie his agenda.",
      "Mailers from Musk\u2019s America PAC feature photographs of the president. \u201cPresident Donald Trump needs your vote,\u201d they read. Others warn that \u201cLiberal Susan Crawford will stop President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "America PAC is also offering Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a petition in opposition to \u201cactivist judges\u201d \u2014 and another $100 for each signer they refer.",
      "Republicans have argued that if even 60% of the voters who cast ballots for Trump in November turn out, Schimel can win, helping to drive momentum for the party heading into next year's midterms.",
      "\u201cIn theory, the opposition party should be energized, but we\u2019re feeling very good about the energy on our side of the aisle,\u201d said Andrew Iverson, Wisconsin GOP executive director.",
      "Andrew Romeo, senior adviser to the Musk-backed group Building America\u2019s Future, which has spent millions on the race, issued a recent memo advising Schimel\u2019s campaign to remind voters that he is \u201ca strong conservative and Trump ally.\u201d",
      "Two groups funded by Musk have so far spent more than $14 million on the race, according to a tally by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice \u2014 with plans to spend around $20 million total.",
      "Musk donated another $2 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party on Thursday, the same day the party gave $1.2 million to Schimel\u2019s campaign.",
      "Under Wisconsin law, contributions to candidates are capped, but candidates can accept unlimited cash from state parties, which in turn can accept unlimited cash from donors.",
      "His spending has helped make the race the most expensive judicial election in the nation\u2019s history, with more than $73 million spent so far, according to the Brennan Center, breaking the record set by another Wisconsin Supreme Court race two years ago.",
      "Crawford has also received her own support from billionaires, including philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Democrats are hoping to channel their voters\u2019 outrage at the Trump administration by casting the race as an opportunity to stand up to Musk. After nearly a decade of running against the president, they see Musk as a potentially more divisive figure who can motivate their base voters to turn out.",
      "\u201cThis race is the first real test point in the country on Elon Musk and his influence on our politics, and voters want an opportunity to push back on that and the influence he is trying to make on Wisconsin and the rest of country,\u201d said Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman.",
      "State Democrats have hosted a series of anti-Musk town halls, including one featuring former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, and featured Musk heavily in ads.",
      "Crawford has also seized on Musk, going as far as to refer to her opponent as \u201cElon Schimel\u201d during a recent debate.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let Elon buy the Supreme Court,\u201d read billboards paid for the state Democratic party that depict Musk as Schimel\u2019s puppeteer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many people who are desperate for a way to fight back against what Trump and Musk are doing nationally,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chair, and see the race as an \u201copportunity to punch back.\u201d",
      "Wikler said the party had seen an \u201cexplosive surge\u201d in grassroots and small-donor fundraising from across the country tied to Musk\u2019s involvement. Both in Wisconsin and nationally, Democrats are packing town halls and angrily protesting the Trump administration\u2019s firings of thousands of workers and shutdown of agencies. They have also show disillusionment with their party\u2019s own leaders.",
      "\u201cMost voters still don't know who Crawford and and Schimel are, but they have extremely strong feelings about Musk and Trump,\" he said.",
      "Musk said Saturday that he became involved in the race because it \u201cwill decide how the Congressional districts are drawn in Wisconsin,\u201d echoing Schimel\u2019s claims that Crawford would push through new congressional maps that could favor Democrats.",
      "Schimel\u2019s campaign has relentlessly attacked Crawford for participating in a call with Democratic donors that was advertised in an email as a \u201cchance to put two more House seats in play for 2026,\u201d a reference to the state's redistricting fights that have played out for years.",
      "Crawford has said that she didn\u2019t know that that was how the call had been billed when she joined and that nothing of that nature had been discussed while she was on the line.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s the most important thing, which is a big deal given that the Congressional majority is so razor-thin,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt could cause the House to switch to Democrat if that redrawing takes place, and then we wouldn\u2019t be able to get through the changes that the American people want.\u201d",
      "Musk has also been giving money to Republican members of Congress who have echoed his calls to impeach federal judges whose decisions he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "He has other interests at play.",
      "Democrats and Crawford have noted that, just days before Musk\u2019s groups started spending on the race, Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla sued Wisconsin over a rule banning car manufacturers from operating dealerships \u2014 forcing buyers to purchase Teslas out of state.",
      "The case could ultimately go before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors in New Mexico's busiest judicial district have been pleading with state lawmakers to amend the children's code to address what they call an unbelievable spike in juvenile crime in Albuquerque",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Behind the wheel of the stolen car was a 12-year-old boy. In the front passenger seat was a boy who just days earlier had marked his 11th birthday. He was waving a handgun as a 15-year-old boy in the backseat recorded video of what police described as a deliberate hit-and-run.",
      "A voice believed to be the 15-year-old\u2019s says, \u201cJust bump him, brah.\u201d The driver asks, \u201cLike bump him?\u201d The rear passenger responds, \u201cYeah, just bump him. Go like \u2026 15 \u2026 20.\u201d",
      "The car smashed into a bicyclist on his way to work. The windshield shattered and the car sped away in the predawn hours that May morning.",
      "Months passed with no arrests. Then in February a video of the deadly crash surfaced on social media. Remarkably it led police back to an 11-year-old who last June was arrested and placed in custody for a series of break-ins and burglaries in northeast Albuquerque. Police also accused the boy of shooting and wounding another teen, which prompted an investigation that turned up firearms and a bullet-proof vest that had been stolen from a police vehicle.",
      "But the allegations of running down and killing a person were on another level, one seldom dealt with in New Mexico's juvenile justice system.",
      "The 11-year-old and the other boys in the car, now ages 13 and 16, were arrested last week in connection with the death of Scott Dwight Habermehl, a father of two and a successful engineer.",
      "Prosecutors said Friday that all three boys will face the same charges: counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, leaving the scene of an accident involving great bodily harm or death and unlawful possession of a handgun by a person under 19. Prosecutors are seeking to have the oldest boy charged as an adult.",
      "The spike in juvenile violence \u2014 particularly this latest case \u2014 has shaken the community, further frustrated law enforcement and added to the pressure on policymakers to reconsider the limitations of a juvenile justice system that wasn't designed to deal with children as young as 11.",
      "Authorities say there's a perception among juveniles that they won't face consequences for violent crimes.",
      "Albuquerque police have arrested numerous teens, most being 15 or older, in homicide cases over the last year. Legal experts and authorities can't recall a case in which someone as young as 11 has faced a murder charge.",
      "Under state law, the 11-year-old cannot be held in a juvenile detention center but will remain in the custody of the state child welfare agency. The other two boys were ordered to remain in a juvenile detention center as their cases proceed, with children's court judges finding they were a danger to themselves and the community.",
      "Santa Fe-based attorney John Day said New Mexico\u2019s juvenile justice system was meant to intervene and get help for children so they wouldn't commit crimes as adults. It was designed with the assumption that kids this young weren't competent to engage in this kind of violent behavior, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously when you have 11-year-olds who are being accused of participating in running over bicyclists and brandishing guns, that\u2019s something that when they were drafting these laws was really not taken into consideration because it was a different time,\u201d Day said.",
      "There is a minimum age for prosecuting juveniles in 26 states, with statutes spelling out various exceptions, according to the National Juvenile Justice Network. But New Mexico is among the many states without a minimum age and state law allows for teenagers as young as 14 in some instances to be tried in adult court only for first-degree murder.",
      "Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman says the streets have changed dramatically since 1993, the last time New Mexico's children's code was meaningfully updated, but the Democratic-controlled Legislature has failed to consider changes that include expanding the types of violent crimes juveniles could be charged in as adults.",
      "Without modernizing the system and pairing meaningful consequences with behavioral health support, Bregman said things will only get worse. He pointed to a proliferation of guns and social media, saying it's out of control.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how they all communicate. This is how they settle grudges. It\u2019s not taking a fistfight behind the high school anymore. They\u2019re pulling out a gun and shooting at an unsanctioned car show,\" he said, referring to a deadly shooting at a park in Las Cruces on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe need to have our laws catch up with the times,\u201d Bregman said.",
      "Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Saturday reiterated her disappointment that lawmakers failed to pass legislation to address juvenile justice and what she described as a crime crisis. She said lawmakers should expect to be called back for a special session.",
      "Before the creation of juvenile courts more than a century ago, children who were older than 7 were processed and incarcerated under common law just as adults would be. Younger children were considered incapable of possessing criminal intent.",
      "Along with that history, the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention notes on its website that the juvenile court system also was established to provide positive social development for children who lack support at home.",
      "Juvenile justice advocates say cases in which young children are accused of murder are rare but not unheard of. In 2008, Arizona prosecutors handled the case of an 8-year-old boy who shot and killed his father and his father's friend. He pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the death of the friend. Prosecutors dropped the charge for killing his father, saying it was best for the boy not to have to acknowledge killing his father.",
      "Some advocates have pushed for setting the minimum age for prosecution at least 14, citing research suggesting children who enter the juvenile justice system earlier in their lives have more adverse outcomes than older teens.",
      "Before knowing the hit-and-run in New Mexico was deliberate, authorities had warned in a criminal complaint naming the 11-year-old in other crimes that the pattern of misconduct was escalating in violence. The document went on to suggest the boy was a danger to himself and the public.",
      "Cases like this beg questions about how children end up in situations like this and what systems failed them along the way, said Amy Borror, a senior youth policy strategist with The Gault Center, a Washington, D.C.-based youth rights advocacy group.",
      "Another consideration, she said, is that adolescents' brains are wired differently. Borror pointed specifically to the part of the brain that controls reasoning, rational thought and the ability to comprehend the effects of actions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why kids and teenagers act exactly like kids and teenagers act,\u201d she said, referring to risk-seeking behavior that intensifies while in groups.",
      "The difficulty comes with figuring out how to hold someone accountable when they don't have the same level of rational decision making that adults do, said Joshua Kastenberg, a former lawyer and judge in the U.S. Air Force who now teaches at the University of New Mexico Law School.",
      "\u201cKids in the criminal justice system are one of the more difficult questions in the law,\u201d Kastenberg said. \u201cUnlike adults, where you can simply say, \u2018Well, this person intentionally ran down a cyclist in their car, they\u2019re a danger to society.\u2019 Whether they have anger management problems or they hate cyclists or whatever, they completely disregarded the right of another human being to simply live. ... But when you\u2019re talking about kids, none of that sinks in.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A jury in Georgia has ordered Monsanto parent Bayer to pay nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who says the company\u2019s Roundup weed killer caused his cancer",
      "NEW YORK -- A jury in Georgia has ordered Monsanto parent Bayer to pay nearly $2.1 billion in damages to a man who says the company's Roundup weed killer caused his cancer, according to attorneys representing the plaintiff.",
      "The verdict marks the latest in a long-running series of court battles Monsanto has faced over its Roundup herbicide. The agrochemical giant says it will appeal the verdict, reached in a Georgia courtroom late Friday, in efforts to overturn the decision.",
      "The penalties awarded include $65 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages, law firms Arnold & Itkin LLP and Kline & Specter PC said in a statement. That marks one of the largest verdicts in a Roundup-related case to date.",
      "Plaintiff John Barnes filed his lawsuit against Monsanto in 2021, seeking damages related to his non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Arnold & Itkin attorney Kyle Findley, the lead trial lawyer on the case, said the verdict will help put his client in a better position to get the treatment he needs going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road for him ... and he was happy that the truth related to the product (has) been exposed,\u201d Findley told The Associated Press on Sunday. He called the verdict an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d after \"another example of Monsanto\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for poisoning people with this toxic product.\u201d",
      "Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, has continued to dispute claims that Roundup causes cancer. But the company has been hit with more than 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and set aside $16 billion to settle cases.",
      "In a statement, Monsanto said Friday's verdict \u201cconflicts with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of regulatory bodies and their scientific assessments worldwide.\u201d The company added that it continues \u201cto stand fully behind the safety\u201d of Roundup products.",
      "For a variety of crops \u2014 including corn, soybeans and cotton \u2014 Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller\u2019s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.",
      "Some studies associate Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Still, numerous lawsuits over the weedkiller allege glyphosate does cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, arguing that Monsanto has failed to warn the public about serious risks for years.",
      "Findley said that evidence relating to Barnes' case show \u201cmany years of cover-ups\" and \u201cbackroom dealings.\u201d He accused Monsanto of ignoring several scientific studies related to the toxicity of Roundup and said the company \u201ctried to find ways to persuade and distract and deny the connection between this product and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\u201d",
      "Friday's decision marks the fourth Roundup-related verdict that Findley's team has won to date \u2014 the largest of which was awarded in Philadelphia in January 2024, with damages totaling $2.25 billion. And he said his law firm has \u201cmany more clients who are similarly situated as Mr. Barnes.\u201d",
      "Monsanto, meanwhile, also maintains that it \u201cremains committed to trying cases\u201d \u2014 and argues its wider record of Roundup-related litigation continues to reinforce the safety of its products. The company said it has prevailed in 17 of the last 25 related trials and \u201cjury verdicts were reduced 90% overall\u201d in past cases that have been finalized.",
      "Bayer has recently renewed and expanded an effort across a handful of U.S. states to protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn that a product causes cancer, if labeling otherwise complies with EPA regulations. The company and other industry supports argue that litigation costs are unstainable and could impact Roundup\u2019s future availability. But opponents stress that such legislation would limit accountability.",

      "The phrase \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d",
      "The phrase \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d has been expressed by protesters from the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising in China to those who opposed COVID-19 restrictions in the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Malcolm X referenced it in his 1964 \u201cBallot or the Bullet\u201d speech, demanding equal rights for Black Americans. President Donald Trump quoted it on his Truth Social platform last year, lambasting a judge during his criminal hush money trial.",
      "The phrase was reportedly first used 250 years ago Sunday by lawyer and legislator Patrick Henry to persuade Virginia colonists to prepare for war against an increasingly punitive Great Britain, just weeks before the American Revolution.",
      "Tensions were coming to a boil, particularly in Massachusetts, where the British replaced elected officials, occupied Boston and shuttered the harbor.",
      "\u201cThe entire episode was about helping our brethren in Massachusetts,\u201d said historian John Ragosta, who wrote a book on Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s about the community. It\u2019s about the nation. It\u2019s not about, \u2018What do I get out of this personally?\u2019\u201d",
      "The printed version of Henry\u2019s galvanizing speech in a crowded church was about 1,200 words. And yet those seven words have survived the centuries like a line from a Shakespeare play.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very malleable phrase,\u201d said Patrick Henry Jolly, a fifth great grandson of Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s something that can be applied to many different circumstances. But I think it\u2019s important that people understand the original context.\u201d",
      "Jolly is set to reenact Henry\u2019s speech Sunday in the same church where his ancestor delivered it. The presentation, which will be streamed online, is part of Virginia's commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the nation's birth.",
      "Here's more information on Henry and his speech:",
      "Born to an influential Virginia family in 1736, Henry became a successful trial lawyer in his 20s.",
      "According to the Library of Congress, he once astonished a courtroom with an argument that \u201cman is born with certain inalienable rights,\u201d an idea echoed in the Declaration of Independence.",
      "In 1765, Henry won a seat in Virginia's colonial legislature. He was instrumental in opposing Great Britain's Stamp Act, which levied a direct tax on the American colonies to raise money for Britain.",
      "As tensions increased, many Americans felt like second-class citizens with no representation in parliament, Ragosta said. By the time of Henry's speech, many were thinking: \"The king won\u2019t listen to us. They\u2019ve invaded Boston. What should we in Virginia do about that?\"",
      "In his 2004 book, \u201cFounding Myths,\u201d historian Ray Raphael wrote \u201cit is highly unlikely\u201d Henry said, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d",
      "Henry did not write down the speech and the version we know today was published 42 years later in an 1817 biography of him. The biographer, attorney William Wirt, pieced together Henry's words from the decades-old recollections of people who were there.",
      "The printed version, Raphael wrote, \u201creflects the agendas of 19th century nationalists who were fond of romanticizing war.\u201d",
      "But other historians said there is ample evidence Henry uttered those words.",
      "\u201cWe have multiple people, years later, saying, \u2018I remember like it was yesterday,'\" Ragosta said, adding that Thomas Jefferson was one of them.",
      "They recalled Henry lifting a letter opener that looked like a dagger and plunging it under his arm as if into his chest before saying the famous phrase.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s 18th century oratory,\" Ragosta said. \u201dIt\u2019s very impassioned.\"",
      "Jon Kukla, another historian who wrote a book on Henry, cited other evidence. Men in Virginia's militias soon embroidered their heavy canvas shirts with \u201cliberty or death.\u201d",
      "The popular 1712 play \u201cCato\u201d about a Roman senator also contains the line, \u201cIt is not now a time to talk of aught, but chains or conquest, liberty or death.\"",
      "\u201cIt would have been part of the literate culture of the age,\u201d Kukla said.",
      "The most immediate impact of Henry's speech was more support for independence and the expansion of Virginia's militias.",
      "In the months afterward, Henry and others also were driven by fears that the British would free enslaved people, Raphael suggests in \u201cFounding Myths.\"",
      "Virginia\u2019s royal governor, Lord Dunmore, offered freedom to enslaved people who fought for the British.",
      "But Ragosta said that was not a primary motivation for Henry, who enslaved dozens of people.",
      "\u201cThat does move a lot of people off the fence into the patriot column, undoubtedly,\u201d Ragosta said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on with the Jeffersons, the Washingtons, the Henrys. They had already been very committed to the patriot movement.\u201d",
      "Following independence, Henry served as Virginia's governor five times. He also became known as an anti-federalist, opposing ratification of the U.S. Constitution and a strong central government.",
      "But Henry later spoke in support of the founding document at George Washington's urging in 1799, the year Henry died.",
      "\u201cHe says, \u2018Look, I voted against the Constitution, but we the people voted for it. And so we have to abide by it,\u2019\u201d Ragosta said.",
      "Jolly, Henry's descendant, said most people react positively to his ancestor's famous words and acknowledge their historical significance.",
      "\u201cAnd there are some people that react thinking that it's a rallying cry for them today to defend their rights \u2014 on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "Yet Henry and his contemporaries were careful to distinguish liberty from license, said Kukla, the historian.",
      "\u201cLiberty, as they understood it, was not the freedom to do anything you damn well pleased,\" Kukla said.",

      "Rachel Reeves has ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the weak performance of the UK economy and world events. Reeves is due make her statement in Parliament at about 12:30.",
      "Afterwards, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors the government's spending plans - will publish its forecast for the UK economy.",
      "It will also say whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending.",
      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings alongside her economic plans.",

      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event each year - the Budget.",
      "She has already signalled that she will neither raise taxes nor government budgets in this statement.",
      "However, with the government under pressure over its finances, she is expected to update her growth forecast, and provide more detail on policies already announced.",
      "Welfare spending",
      "Cuts designed to save \u00a35bn year by 2030 from the welfare bill were announced on 18 March.",
      "These include stricter tests for personal independence (Pip) payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits.",

      "To get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "She has repeatedly said her rules are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "However the OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that low financial growth and higher government borrowing costs are making it much harder to meet these rules by the 2029-30 financial year, as planned.",
      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "In February the Bank of England halved its growth forecast for the UK in 2025.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it shrank by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy is growing slowly - or contracting - businesses may not take on extra workers or give pay rises. Lower profits mean firms pay less in tax, which funds government spending.",

      "Meanwhile inflation is rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current 3% rate is above the Bank of England's 2% target - and is expected to increase in 2025.",
      "The Bank moves interest rates to try and keep inflation on target, and cuts are less likely when prices rises are above 2%.",
      "Higher interest rates make loans, credit cards and some mortgages more expensive, but mean better returns for savers.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war - as a result of new worldwide US tariffs, would further lower growth and raise inflation."

    "story": [
      "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.",
      "But there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.",
      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",
      "North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.",
      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",

    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

      "Ticketmaster \"may have misled Oasis fans\" with unclear pricing when it put their reunion tour on sale last year, the UK's competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have breached consumer protection law by selling \"platinum\" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.",
      "\"This risked giving consumers the misleading impression that platinum tickets were better,\" it said in an update to its investigation into Ticketmaster.",

      "More than 900,000 tickets were sold for Oasis's long-awaited reunion tour, when they went on sale on 31 August last year",
      "But many fans were left out of pocket, when standard standing tickets advertised at \u00a3135 plus fees were re-labelled \"in demand\" and changed on Ticketmaster to \u00a3355 plus fees.",

      "The CMA launched its investigation in September, to examine whether Ticketmaster had engaged in \"unfair commercial practices,\" and whether fans were pressured to buy tickets within a short period of time.",

      "Changes requested",
      "The CMA did not comment on the issue of dynamic pricing, but said that Ticketmaster made it difficult for Oasis fans to make \"informed choices\".",
      "For example, it said, customers did not know that there were \"two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first\".",
      "This resulted in \"many fans waiting in a lengthy queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide whether to pay a higher price than they expected,\" the CMA continued.",
      "The watchdog acknowledged that Ticketmaster had made some changes to its business practices since the Oasis sale last August.",
      "However, it said, \"the CMA does not currently consider these changes are sufficient to address its concerns\".",

      "Glenshire said it is \"absolutely committed to robust employment practices\" and said it is \"listening to our colleagues, to understand where there are concerns\".",
      "Cian, 30, has been delivering pizzas in the west of Glasgow for more than two years. An employee of Pizza Hut franchise, Glenshire Group, he has always been paid the National Living Wage plus a fee of \u00a31.45 per delivery.",
      "But he said his terms and conditions were changed without consultation or warning.",
      "He said two weeks ago he and several other drivers were told via text message that his pay had increased to \u00a312.21 an hour but he had lost his \u00a31.45 delivery payments, or what the company calls \"discretionary driver commissions\".",
      "''The \u00a31.45 would pay for my fuel and a tiny bit of the running cost of my car but I've been living paycheque to paycheque,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We had multiple drivers just quit because they simply can't afford to do this job if they're having to pay for their own fuel. There's one shop that has lost every single one of their drivers.''",
      "In a letter to staff dated 10 March, seen by the BBC, Glenshire said: \"We have removed discretionary driver commissions with effect from today. This change is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our operations.\"",
      "The letter does not state that the company has any plans in place to ensure drivers' expenses will be paid by Glenshire.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the company said that ''driver commissions have not been reduced, rather the remuneration model has changed from a 'per delivery' amount to a 'per mile' basis\".",
      "'Attempt to offload drivers'",
      "Unite's head of hospitality, Bryan Simpson has accused Glenshire of ''a cynical attempt to offload over 100 drivers'' before the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs), the National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage on 1 April.",
      "Among the increases next month, the National Living Wage for people aged 21 and over will rise from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21.",
      "\"I have never seen something so blatantly unlawful occur, even in an industry, frankly, that is not known for decent workers rights. This is the worst that I've came across in over a decade,\" Mr Simpson said.",
      "He said the loss of drivers' commission per delivery could effectively mean that \"these workers are going to be brought below the minimum wage.",
      "\"They're going to be losing thousands of pounds a year. So, as far as we are concerned, this is fire and rehire under a different name.''",
      "'Not worth me keeping my job'",
      "Unite's grievance, seen exclusively by the BBC, also accused Glenshire of acting ''fraudulently'' by going into old staff timesheets and retroactively adding unpaid 20 minute rest breaks.",
      "In a text message seen by the BBC, Glenshire director Zibby Ghafoor told store managers ''all time sheets have been deleted for last week..can we please add breaks in.\"",
      "Unite claims Glenshire unlawfully deducted these breaks from their wages.",
      "In its statement, Glenshire said that there have been \"no changes to break policies\".",
      "A manager called Adam, not his real name, said he works for hours on his own in his store. He said it's simply not possible to take breaks.",
      "\"You do not get your 20 minutes of uninterrupted time ever...so not only do we not get breaks, we now get charged for the breaks that we don't take.''",
      "Cian says it's his ''civic duty'' to speak out even though he knows it could put him at risk of losing his job. ''I'm trying to help people who can't stand up for themselves, because the way the Glenshire group have treated everyone is abysmal. The long term ramifications of what they are doing, it's just not worth me keeping my job.''",
      "Glenshire Group employs more than 200 staff including more than 100 delivery drivers although over the last few days, the BBC understands several have quit.",
      "In the 10 March letter to staff, Glenshire said that with the increases in employer NICs and the National Living Wage rise on 1 April it was having to \"reassess our driver delivery model in order to retain business viability\".",
      "It also said drivers could choose to switch from being employed to self-employed.",
      "The letter stressed this would be a voluntary choice and would not be compulsory. Glenshire last night told the BBC there were \"no blanket changes to self-employed contracts taking place\".",
      "Call to investigate",
      "Employment lawyer Joanne Moseley of Irwin Mitchell warned that from 1 April, when the new National Living Wage is introduced, Glenshire could be in breach of minimum wage regulations.",
      "\"If Glenshire doesn't reimburse its drivers for payments they've incurred in connection with their employment - in this case their petrol expenses - they will be in breach of the NMW regulations. HMRC will investigate and has the power to impose financial penalties,\" she says.",
      "Adam called on bosses of the Pizza Hut company to investigate the Glenshire franchise.",
      "\"Please be aware of what this company are doing to your brand. Please be aware of what they're doing to the staff and all for their own benefit, all to save them money,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson for Pizza Hut UK said: \"Pizza Hut is deeply committed to ensuring a safe and fair working environment for all employees and as such has strict policies in place that its franchise businesses must adhere to.",
      "\"Although Glenshire Group operates as an independent franchisee and is ultimately responsible for its own employment practices, we take these allegations seriously.",
      "\"Glenshire will be actively engaging in the coming days with any concerned employees, and we will continue to investigate this situation.\""

      "Ministers have delayed a tax to fund the removal of unsafe cladding from homes after developers warned it could hamper the government's housebuilding plans.",
      "The Ministry for Housing said on Monday the Building Safety Levy would be introduced from autumn 2026, rather than this year.",
      "The tax on new homes is expected to raise \u00a33.4bn to be spent on building safety, including efforts to take down dangerous cladding.",
      "The delay comes after developers said the tax could increase building costs and result in the government missing its target to build 1.5 million homes by 2030.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook told LBC the government was still committed to the tax and insisted the delay would not slow down the pace of improving building safety.",
      "\"The previous government left us with an unpalatable inheritance in that respect,\" Pennycook said.",
      "\"We've got to increase ther pace of works being done. Leaseholders are still trapped in these buildings.\"",
      "Neil Jefferson, chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, welcomed the delay as \"recognition from government that these additional costs will inevitably constrain housing supply\".",
      "But he suggested the \"grossly unfair\" tax on housing developers should be scrapped altogether.",
      "He said: \"As proposed it will add thousands of pounds to the cost of new homes, threatening the viability of sites across swathes of the country at a time when industry is striving to reverse the decline in homebuilding numbers that we have seen in recent years.\"",
      "Cladding removal plan not ambitious enough, say MPs",
      "New deadlines set for fixing dangerous cladding",
      "The tax was first announced in 2021 by the then-Conservative government.",
      "Some of the money raised from the tax will go towards the removal of dangerous cladding from buildings, following the deadly fire at Grenfell Tower.",
      "Ministers have set aside \u00a35.1bn to resolve the cladding crisis, expecting developers, building owners and social housing providers to pay the rest.",
      "Thousands of homes have been made safe, but as of December last year, work had yet to start on a quarter of the 1,323 tall buildings requiring attention.",
      "Up to 12,000 buildings and three million people could be affected.",
      "The lengthy process of identifying what work needs to be done and who should pay for it has left many residents living in fear of fires or with worries over costly repair bills.",
      "In its general election manifesto, Labour pledged to \"take decisive action to improve building safety\" and to \"put a renewed focus on ensuring those responsible for the building safety crisis pay to put it right\".",
      "Last year, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government was planning to introduce the Building Safety Levy in September this year.",
      "But in a letter to Rayner, dozens of developers said \"the ability of the industry to invest in increasing the supply of new homes to meet the government's 1.5 million target is being threatened by the imposition of new taxes\".",
      "Housebuilders say they are already paying \u00a36.5bn towards improving building safety through corporation tax and argue makers of unsafe cladding should bear more of the costs.",
      "Home Builders Federation estimates the tax could add \u00a31,580 to the cost of building a home and lead to the loss of about 70,000 affordable homes over 10 years.",
      "A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"This government is determined to make Britain's homes safer by making developers pay their fair share to fix unsafe buildings through the Building Safety Levy.",
      "\"We have extended the timeline to give developers more time to factor levy costs into their plans while continuing to support them to build safe homes, and at the same time we are continuing to work quickly to fix buildings with unsafe cladding through our Remediation Acceleration Plan.\""

      "The\u00a0Post\u00a0Office\u00a0is being removed from one of the schemes set up to compensate victims of the Horizon IT scandal.",
      "The\u00a0government\u00a0will\u00a0now take\u00a0over\u00a0responsibility for the\u00a0Overturned\u00a0Convictions\u00a0Scheme, which provides redress for those who have had their convictions quashed",
      "In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.",
      "However, the government stopped short of taking control of a separate scheme for people who believe they experienced financial shortfalls, despite it being a key recommendation of the Business and Trade Committee report.",
      "The committee has asked ministers to revise their response.",
      "It is yet another twist in the long-running Post Office scandal.",
      "Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.",
      "More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.",
      "We've broken down how they work.",
      "What are the main compensation schemes?",
      "There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.",
      "The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.",
      "Which scheme is available to Alan Bates and others depicted in the ITV drama?",
      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",
      "The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.",
      "As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme \"will receive at least \u00a375,000 in compensation upfront\".",
      "The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.",
      "On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.",
      "As of 31 January, \u00a3128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.",
      "Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.",
      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",
      "A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January.But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.",
      "Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00a3600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.",
      "All eligible people are entitled to an \"interim\" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.",
      "For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "This will entitle them to an initial \u00a3200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept \u00a3600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.",
      "As of 31 January, external, \u00a365m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.",
      "The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out.",
      "A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.",

      "Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.",
      "In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.",
      "It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.",
      "It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.",
      "It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data, external from the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "Around \u00a3315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025.",
      "How many people are eligible for compensation overall?",
      "The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.",
      "It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.",
      "What about people who died before receiving compensation?",
      "On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.",

      "Separately, Trump suggested he was softening his plans for tariffs on imports from other countries, saying he \"may give a lot of countries breaks\".",
      "Markets ended the day higher after the comments, which appeared to confirm reports that he was narrowing the taxes he plans to announce on 2 April.",

      "Trump has already raised tariffs on Chinese imports to at least 20% since February.  He told reporters he intended the latest announcement to be added on top of existing levies.",
      "For Venezuela, China is a major buyer of its oil. But Venezuela is not a big source of crude for China, which imported more than 11 million barrels per day last year.",
      "The US is a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, as a result of exemptions from economic sanctions granted to US oil firm Chevron.",

    "story": [
      "English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.",
      "The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by \u00a3500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system \"so we know who is the best and who is not the best\".",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than \"reactively\" fixing potholes.",
      "Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost \u00a317bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.",
      "According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.",
      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",
      "'Not helpful'",
      "However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was \"nowhere near the amount that is needed\".",
      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",
      "\"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.\"",
      "But the prime minister said \"any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you\".",
      "\"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money.\"",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole\".",
      "Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to \"comply with these requirements\".",
      "\"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,\" she said.",
      "Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.",
      "By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.",
      "The DfT added that councils who \"fail to meet these strict conditions\" will see 25% of the funding withheld.",
      "During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.",
      "'Preventative measures'",
      "The LGA said it was in \"everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent\".",
      "\"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,\" it added.",
      "Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a \"pothole sticking plaster\".",
      "He said: \"Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats transport spokesman Paul Kohler called for a \"more sustainable approach\" to repairs, saying fixing individual potholes was welcome but did little to address a \"crumbling road infrastructure\".",

      "\"I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers' money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people is properly scrutinised.

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

      "He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".",
      "Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".",
      "That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.",
      "This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.",
      "Internationally embarrassing",
      "Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.",
      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",
      "The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.",

      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",

      "\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.",
      "A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.",
      "Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only as important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd65p1pv8pdo",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3911lv1pzko",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 19:47:35 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",
      "Now he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "story": [
      "The University of Sussex has been fined \u00a3585,000 by the higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), for failing to uphold freedom of speech.",
      "It follows the case of Prof Kathleen Stock, who left the university in 2021 after being accused of transphobia for her views on sex and gender issues.",
      "The OfS criticised the university's policy statement on Trans and Non-Binary equality, saying its requirement to \"positively represent trans people\" and an assertion that \"transphobic propaganda [would] not be tolerated\" could lead staff and students to \"self-censor\".",
      "The University of Sussex plans to challenge the OfS findings legally, Vice-Chancellor Prof Sasha Roseneil said.",
      "Describing the judgement as an \"unreasonably absolutist definition of free speech\", the university warned that the ruling left institutions facing \"opposing and irreconcilable duties\" which rendered them \"powerless to prevent abusive, bullying and harassing speech\".",
      "The OfS, it added, had pursued a \"vindictive and unreasonable campaign\" against it.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said free speech and academic freedom were \"non-negotiables\" in universities.",
      "\"I have been clear that where those principles are not upheld, robust action will be taken,\" she said.",
      "\"If you go to university you must be prepared to have your views challenged, hear contrary opinions and be exposed to uncomfortable truths.",
      "\"We are giving the OfS stronger powers on freedom of speech so students and academics are not muzzled by the chilling effect demonstrated in this case.\"",
      "The OfS was given the power in January to issue fines where freedom of speech was not upheld at a university.",
      "Arif Ahmed, the OfS director for freedom of speech and academic freedom, said the decision to fine the university had followed a thorough investigation.",
      "It found, he said, that the policy had meant staff feared disciplinary action and Prof Stock had changed the way she taught her course as a result.",
      "Mr Ahmed added that the OfS was \"concerned that a chilling effect may have caused many more students and academics at the university to self-censor\".",
      "The regulator said the Trans and Non-Binary Equality Policy Statement issued by the University of Sussex was looked at in the context of existing legal duties on freedom of speech as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.",
      "In its report, the OfS found four elements of the policy to be \"concerning\".",
      "These included a requirement for course materials to \"positively represent trans people and trans lives\" and an assertion that \"transphobic propaganda\u2026 [would] not be tolerated\".",
      "Another part of the policy highlighted by the regulator said \"transphobic abuse\" would be a serious disciplinary offence for staff and students.",
      "It also looked at the management and governance of the university around freedom of speech.",
      "Prof Stock faced protests on the university campus after she published a book questioning whether gender identity was more \"socially significant\" than biological sex.",
      "Posters were put up on the campus calling for her to be sacked, and students turned up with placards at an open day.",
      "Prof Stock rejected accusations that she was transphobic and described the experience to the BBC as a \"surreal anxiety dream\".",
      "She resigned from her university post in 2021 and was awarded an OBE for services to education.",
      "The fine is the largest issued to a university and is likely to be seen as an intention to hold the line over the expression of legal views.",
      "In a strongly worded statement, the University of Sussex said the regulator had been determined to make an example of its case and \"entrench an extreme libertarian free speech position\".",
      "It added there had been no \"substantive engagement\" other than via written correspondence, and it accused the regulator of pursuing a \"vindictive and unreasonable campaign\".",

      "He says teachers need to be able to cope with stress in the classroom, but that mobile phones, challenging behaviour and pupil disengagement have become a growing problem.",
      "Stuart says the amount of stress outside the classroom has also risen dramatically due to qualifications and increasing amounts of paperwork.",
      "\"In my view teaching should be quite a simple job and if you add layers and layers of data collecting and bureaucracy it adds stress,\" he says.",

      "She said: \"While the different recording methods used by the different councils made it difficult to get a Scotland-wide picture, individual council responses were alarming.",
      "Ms Payne said the Scottish government should investigate the issue further.",
      "\"While the growing number of teachers badly affected by stress is obviously deeply worrying on a personal level, the increasing number of days lost also represents more disruption to learning for pupils,\" she added.",
      "\"The figures don't give an indication of whether a small number of teachers have been off for long periods, which may be easier to manage in terms of securing cover, or if an increasing number of teachers are of for small amounts of time, which can be more difficult to plan around.\"",
      "'Making meaningful progress'",
      "Last year the EIS union commissioned research looking at workload and stress. It found that on average, teachers were working more than 11 additional hours a week, unpaid, on top of their contractual hours.",
      "A spokeswoman for the EIS said that \"soaring\" levels of stress and stress-related illness were a very serious concern.",
      "\"The Scottish government and local authorities, as the employers of teachers, must act in line with their duty of care to ensure that the current crippling workload burden on teachers is lightened.\"",
      "Councillor Joan Griffiths, Edinburgh City Council's education, children and families convener, said she was \"saddened\" by the absence figures.",
      "\"The health and wellbeing of the over 3,000 teachers employed by the council is incredibly important to us,\" she said.",
      "She said a range of support and resources were available to help, and that teachers who have concerns about their workload or mental health are encouraged to raise this with their line manager.",
      "Angus Council said it recognised the challenges of the teaching profession and had a range of measures in place to support staff affected by stress.",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson said it had allocated more than \u00a32m in recent years to specifically support the wellbeing of the education workforce.",

      "Teachers unable to get divorced because of delays getting their pensions valued are taking legal action against the government.",
      "Hundreds of teachers have been frustrated by long delays that left them \"in limbo\", unable to move on with their lives or plan for their future.",
      "Construction skills lecturer David Quinton, from Gloucestershire, said the legal action was not just about financial compensation but making the government \"realise that they have affected people's mental well being\".",
      "The government, which issued an apology in December, has told the BBC there are now 620 people - including recent applicants - waiting for valuations, down from 3,062 in October 2024.",
      "\"I know a statement has been issued with an apology, but I don't think that apology is worth anything truthfully. It's a bit too little, too late,\" Mr Quinton said.",
      "In December, Teachers' Pensions - which runs the scheme on behalf of the Department for Education - said it aimed to clear most of the backlog by the end of February, with the government describing the calculations as \"extremely complex\".",
      "The value of a pension is needed by the courts to decide whether it should be shared with an ex-partner, and without which it is almost impossible to reach a financial settlement.",
      "A Cash Equivalent Transfer Value (CETV) is usually provided within three months of  a request being submitted but some teachers have been waiting much longer.",
      "Mr Quinton applied for a CETV in October 2023 as part of divorce proceedings and got it on 29 January this year, 15 months after applying.",
      "Although he has now received his valuation, he said there is \"still a long way to go\" to finalise his divorce.",
      "'Made accountable'",
      "He now wants to join a group action being brought by the teaching union NASUWT and legal firm Leigh Day against the pension provider and the Department for Education.",
      "\"I think it's important that the government need to realise that they have affected people's mental well being. They have affected them financially. And there has to be an impact on them for not doing that,\" he said.",
      "\"It's important that those thousands of people [affected] have a voice and the way that we have a voice is by joining this action.\"",
      "Mr Quinton estimates that the \"elongated\" process of getting the CETV has now cost him upward of \u00a38,000 in solicitors' bills.",
      "Wendy Dopheide, 60, is an English and drama teacher from Warminster, Wiltshire, and said she would also consider legal action.",
      "\"I can't overstate just how stressful this is for people like me in this situation,\" she said.",
      "\"By the age of 60, which I am now, many people are starting to look forward to retirement. I can't do that because I have no idea about what my financial situation will be when I do retire and whether I'll be able to afford to live.\"",
      "She originally applied for her CETV in August 2023 but is still waiting. She said the December update claiming that the backlog would be cleared by the end of February made her \"hopeful\", but that since then she has been met with a \"stony silence\".",
      "\"When I heard about it, I thought 'wow, I can start to move on and get the information that I need',\" she said.",
      "\"And I heard nothing back, nothing at all.\"",
      "A similar feeling of being left in the dark is shared by Philip Hawkins, a 57-year-old retired art teacher, from Exeter.",
      "He first contacted Teachers' Pensions about a CETV in October last year.",
      "He was told he would have to pay for the valuation and that he would be sent an invoice. It took five months for that invoice to arrive.",
      "\"Each time I was calling up, I was told I would get a response within a certain number of days, 10 days, and never would get that response,\" he said.",
      "\"When I'd phone up again, I would say 'what's happened to my previous request?' I would get the same answer, that this is being escalated and we'll get back to you and each time no one ever gets back to me.",
      "\"I've felt like throwing my phone out the window and knocking my head against the wooden table because I felt there's nothing I can do here.\"",
      "He received and paid an invoice for the CETV earlier this month, but said that he is \"very anxious\" that he could be waiting another year or two for the valuation.",
      "\"It's very tiring and it's something that wears away at you.\"",
      "Ryan Bradshaw, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, is leading the lawsuit.",
      "\"There's a clear statutory obligation within the legislation that states that Teachers' Pensions must provide CETV calculations within three months of any request,\" Mr Bradshaw said.",
      "\"We've got people who've been waiting in excess of 12 months for a calculation.",
      "\"They've been let down by the pension scheme administrators. They've been let down by the Department for Education... and then they're let down by the regulators and the (Pensions) Ombudsman, who've allowed this situation to persist for so long.\"",
      "Complex calculations",
      "In an update to its members last week, Teachers' Pensions again apologised for the ongoing delays.",
      "It had previously explained that a judgement, known as the McCloud pension remedy, resulted in the government making changes to public service pension schemes, and calculating valuations in a new way.",
      "Teachers' Pensions said that it had been waiting on guidance to be produced and that preparing that took \"a long time to agree for consistency [across all public service pension schemes] and to ensure calculations don't need to be revisited\".",
      "In December, the Department for Education said the delays were not a result of having too few staff.",
      "Teachers' Pensions has now confirmed that 80% of that backlog has been cleared, and that it is looking at other options to provide the remaining applicants with their valuations in lieu of a CETV.",
      "'Wider impact'",
      "Capita, who is the current administrator of the Teachers' Pensions scheme, said the delays have been outside of its control and it is \"continuing to work closely with the Department for Education to complete the remaining cases\".",
      "Meanwhile Mr Bradshaw recommends that any teachers affected by the delays pay attention to the outcome of the case.",
      "\"The main thing is that this is being brought as a collective action and.... the changes that arise as a result of any legal action can have a wider impact than just the group of those people that we're representing.\"",
      "He urged people to speak to their own union representatives and keep up pressure on Teachers' Pensions and the Secretary of State for Education.",
      "\"It's just a case of creating pressure from every single angle. It's not just about bringing legal action, it's also about bringing to bear some form of political pressure as well to try and get a resolution to the wider issues.\"",

      "Parents can apply for 15 hours of childcare from when their child is 23-weeks-old, and for 30 hours once their child is two-years-and-36-weeks-old.",
      "The entitlement starts at the beginning of the term after your child reaches the qualifying age.",
      "The government website has details of the deadlines to apply for each age group., external",
      "Free childcare hours are designed to be used over 38 weeks of the year - during school term time.",
      "However, some providers will stretch them over 52 weeks if you use fewer hours per week.",
      "What is not covered by the free childcare hours?",
      "The government is increasing the hourly rate it pays childcare providers offering free hours.",
      "But in many cases, this rate does not cover the full cost of the childcare. So, some providers charge for extras like meals, nappies, sun cream or trips.",
      "According to research from the Pregnant Then Screwed charity, almost a quarter (23%) of parents it surveyed said they couldn't afford to access free childcare hours because of top-up fees., external",
      "In February, the Department for Education (DfE) wrote to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for these extras, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".",
      "However, some providers say they use these payments to subsidise the cost of the free hours for three and four-year-olds. More than 5,000 nurseries have signed an open letter to the Dfe asking for the new rules to be delayed.",
      "The lack of affordable childcare is a barrier for many people hoping to work",
      "Are there enough childcare places?",
      "The DfE says an additional 35,000 staff and 70,000 places will be required to meet demand by September 2025.",
      "The education regulator Ofsted has warned that access to childcare in England has declined since 2020 and improvements have not been evenly spread across the country.",
      "On average, so-called \"childcare deserts\", external have lower household incomes and higher levels of deprivation than other areas.",
      "The government offers a cash incentive of \u00a3600 to those who become childminders (or \u00a31,200 for those joining via an agency).",
      "The DfE has not given figures for the numbers who have signed up, but says childcare staffing rose by 6% across 2024 as a whole., external However, the number of childminders - those providing early years care in homes - has continued to decrease.",
      "It adds that while the latest ONS data shows the total population of zero to five-year-olds fell by 1% per year from 2018 to 2022, the number of childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said early years had been her \"priority from day one\". However, nursery bosses argue the government's updated funding rates for 2025 will not offset rising costs.",
      "The Early Years Alliance charity said about 185 nurseries of 1,100 it surveyed said they were \"likely\" to withdraw from the scheme within the next 12 months \"due to unsustainable financial pressures\".",
      "What childcare help is available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?",
      "All three and four-year-olds and some two-year-olds in Scotland are entitled to 30 hours a week of funded childcare during term time (or 22 hours a week if used across the year), external, regardless of their parents' working status.",

    "story": [
      "We might feel like we know Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash already. We have seen them live off rice and beans in the Australian rainforest in I'm a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! We have watched Joe learn to ice skate in Dancing on Ice and Stacey declutter homes in Sort Your Life Out.",
      "But the now couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.",
      "It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, \"and then you panic a bit\", she tells the BBC.",
      "But ultimately, they are just a normal family \"doing our best in every aspect of our lives\", she says.",
      "\"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.",
      "\"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.\"",
      "There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.",
      "\"We don't want to glamourise anything,\" says Joe. \"Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.\"",
      "Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016.",
      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",
      "Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.",
      "Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a \"mother lion\".",
      "\"Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you,\" he says.",
      "\"She's just the most wonderful person,\" he says. \"She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.\"",
      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",
      "Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.",
      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",
      "Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being \"oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister\", she says.",
      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",
      "Stacey relied on Zach and \"asked a lot of him\", she says, needing him to help her.",
      "\"I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe,\" she says, \"and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years.\"",
      "But Zach, now 17 himself, is \"probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know,\" says Stacey.",
      "\"I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning.\"",
      "Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.",
      "\"My pelvic floor is dying,\" she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.",
      "Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals.",
      "\"I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow',\" says Joe, \"and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'.\"",
      "\"We were just throwing a few ideas around,\" says Stacey. \"I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.",
      "\"That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children.\"",

    "summary": "CMA concerned that Ticketmaster may have breached consumer protection law for Oasis reunion tour.",
    "story": [
      "Ticketmaster \"may have misled Oasis fans\" with unclear pricing when it put their reunion tour on sale last year, the UK's competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have breached consumer protection law by selling \"platinum\" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.",
      "\"This risked giving consumers the misleading impression that platinum tickets were better,\" it said in an update to its investigation into Ticketmaster.",
      "The CMA has instructed Ticketmaster to change the way it labels tickets and reveals prices to fans in the future. Ticketmaster said it \"welcomed\" the advice.",
      "\"At Ticketmaster, we strive to provide the best ticketing platform through a simple, transparent and consumer-friendly experience,\" a spokesperson told the BBC, via email.",
      "\"We welcome the CMA's input in helping make the industry even better for fans.\"",
      "Dynamic pricing denied",
      "More than 900,000 tickets were sold for Oasis's long-awaited reunion tour, when they went on sale on 31 August last year",
      "But many fans were left out of pocket, when standard standing tickets advertised at \u00a3135 plus fees were re-labelled \"in demand\" and changed on Ticketmaster to \u00a3355 plus fees.",
      "Amid the fall-out, Oasis issued a statement saying they had no \"awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used\" in the sale of tickets for the initial dates.",
      "The CMA launched its investigation in September, to examine whether Ticketmaster had engaged in \"unfair commercial practices,\" and whether fans were pressured to buy tickets within a short period of time.",
      "Ticketmaster subsequently denied using \"dynamic pricing\" to manipulate prices.",
      "\"We don't change prices in any automated or algorithmic way,\" the company's UK director, Andrew Parsons, told MPs last month.",
      "He maintained that all prices are determined by artist teams and promoters - although, in the case of Oasis, the promoter, SJM Concerts, has ties to Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation.",
      "Changes requested",
      "The CMA did not comment on the issue of dynamic pricing, but said that Ticketmaster made it difficult for Oasis fans to make \"informed choices\".",
      "For example, it said, customers did not know that there were \"two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first\".",
      "This resulted in \"many fans waiting in a lengthy queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide whether to pay a higher price than they expected,\" the CMA continued.",
      "The watchdog acknowledged that Ticketmaster had made some changes to its business practices since the Oasis sale last August.",
      "However, it said, \"the CMA does not currently consider these changes are sufficient to address its concerns\".",
      "\"We now expect Ticketmaster to work with us to address these concerns so, in future, fans can make well-informed decisions when buying tickets,\" said Hayley Fletcher, interim senior director of consumer protection.",
      "Downing Street responded to the report by saying \"everyone deserves a fair shot at getting tickets\" for music and sport events.",
      "A spokesperson repeated a quote given by culture secretary Lisa Nandy earlier this year, when the government announced plans to cap the price at which tickets can be resold.",
      "\"The chance to see your favourite musicians or sports teams live is something that all of us enjoy... But for too long fans have had to endure the misery of touts hoovering up tickets for resale at vastly inflated prices.",
      "\"We've also seen cases where a lack of transparency has meant customers have been caught unawares by last minute price rises for high demand events.\"",
      "The spokesman added that a full response to the CMA consultation would be  issued in due course.",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",
      "It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.",
      "Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News",
      "In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.",
      "Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.",
      "You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory.  Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries.",
      "But it's the story they tell that's extraordinary.",
      "Iron Age experts now have evidence that people 2,000 years ago had four wheel wagons as well as two wheel chariots.",
      "They now have proof that Iron Age residents of northern England had trading connections with the continent and the growing Roman Empire.",
      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",
      "\"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\"",
      "The Yorkshire Museum has launched a fundraising campaign to secure the hoard for its collections.",

    "story": [
      "Thom Rylance, frontman of indie band The Lottery Winners, has experienced panic attacks since he was a child. But he'd never had one on stage... until last month.",
      "\"I've got this other, outgoing version of me that does the shows, and he just turns up every time,\" the singer explains.",
      "\"I don't really know him, and I think he's brilliant and quite handsome, but when we played Bournemouth, he just didn't come.\"",
      "The panic manifested as \"a tremendous sense of overwhelming dread\", he says, accompanied by sudden shortness of breath and a racing heartbeat.",
      "He isn't sure how, but he survived the gig without anyone noticing.",
      "YouTube footage shows him goading people into singing Reef's Put Your Hands Up, and taking selfies with fans during the encore.",
      "In his head, though, it was a disaster.",
      "\"I came off stage and I was really apologetic. I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I was awful. I couldn't speak'.",
      "\"And everyone was like, 'What you talking about? It was absolutely fine.'\"",
      "The reaction wasn't entirely unexpected. At the age of 35, Rylance has become adept at masking his anxiety.",
      "It's a topic he addresses frequently (and movingly) on the band's new album, KOKO, whose title is an acronym for \"Keep on keeping on\".",
      "The singer learned the phrase from his grandmother, who used it to comfort him when he was excluded from school.",
      "\"I didn't want to be bad or naughty, but there was something in me [that meant] I couldn't sit through the lessons,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I was expelled and taken away from all my friends, and it made me really sad \u2013 but my gran used to say, 'Keep on keeping on, Thom', and it stuck with me.\"",
      "'Where was my support?'",
      "The singer was belatedly diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, and the sense of relief hit him like a tidal wave.",
      "\"It was like a release of guilt,\" he says. \"Like, nothing I've ever done has ever been my fault!",
      "\"But it also came with a mourning period, where I was looking back and going, 'Where was my support? I didn't have to be a sad child'.",
      "\"I literally remember a teacher saying, 'If you don't do well in your GCSEs then your life is over.' That sent me spiralling because I was like, 'I don't want to be a junkie', you know?",
      "\"So, I've been going into schools recently and talking to kids with ADHD, just to show them that someone who did terribly in education can wake up every day excited and happy and ready for work.\"",
      "Rylance is speaking from Paris, where The Lottery Winners are wrapping up their latest tour.",
      "The band, completed by Robert Lally, Katie Lloyd and Joe Singleton, have been working tirelessly since they formed in Leigh, Greater Manchester, in 2008 \u2013 but success has been a slow grind.",
      "They signed their first record contract with Sire Records in 2016 after boss Seymour Stein (the man responsible for discovering Madonna) called them \"the best band since The Smiths\".",
      "But when he left the label the following year, the group went with him, delaying  their debut album by years.",
      "It finally arrived on British indie label Modern Sky in 2020, a week before the country went into lockdown, making promotion impossible.",
      "Even so, the band's buoyant indie pop songs and engaging online presence (Rylance is one of the funniest and likeable musicians on social media) helped them build a dedicated fanbase.",
      "By 2023, that support was support enough to send their third album, Anxiety Replacement Therapy, to number one, beating releases by The National and Jessie Ware.",
      "For Rylance, who spent his childhood \"feeling like an alien\", it was a huge deal.",
      "\"It's literally a trophy with a number one on it,\" he laughs. \"What bigger symbol of affirmation is there than that?\"",
      "How about being personally invited on tour by Robbie Williams?",
      "That's what happened last October. Robbie heard the band's single You Again on BBC Radio 2 and instantly booked them as his support act this summer.",
      "\"It was a really huge moment for me,\" says Rylance, who made his first public performance singing Williams' song Stronger on a school trip.",
      "\"Robbie's been a huge part of my life, so when he told me, 'I've listened to all of your albums', I was just like, 'What do you mean, Robbie Williams? Why are you saying that to me?'\"",
      "The pair subsequently struck up a firm friendship, and talk almost daily.",
      "\"Robbie's like my therapist,\" says Rylance. \"He's got ADHD as well, so he can relate to the things that overwhelm me.",
      "\"And I can literally ask him anything. I'll be like, 'Robert, how long do I put this pizza in the oven?'\"",
      "But Williams isn't the only famous name in his contacts.",
      "The Lottery Winners have recorded singles with Shaun Ryder, Nickelback and Boy George (\"a mild hit in Greece,\" laughs Rylance), while Noel Gallagher struck up a friendship with Rylance after playing with him last year.",
      "\"These people have always seemed so unreachable,\" he marvels. \"Noel Gallagher is not even... He's barely even a human being!",
      "\"So to have him right there in my phone... I've texted him for advice loads of times.\"",
      "That guiding hand proved crucial last November, when Rylance published an ill-advised tweet criticising musician Kate Nash's campaign to save the live music industry.",
      "He accused Nash of posing as a working class musician, pointing out she'd attended the Brit School - which he mistakenly thought was a private, fee-paying establishment.",
      "\"I wasn't very proud of that, and it ended up in the NME,\" says Rylance. \"They kept contacting me, asking me for a statement, and so I texted Noel, 'What should I do about this, mate?'",
      "\"He was like, 'Just tell them to speak to your new PR officer: Me.",
      "\"'I'll tell them you're too busy being mega to talk to the press.'\"",
      "In the end, Rylance took a different approach, apologising for his comments and offering to work with Nash, but Gallagher's support helped him keep a level head in a tricky moment.",
      "Today, he's still passionate about highlighting the issues around working class access to the arts.",
      "He recalls The Lottery Winners' first gig, at the Collier's Rest Pub in Leigh, 16 years ago.",
      "The venue was so packed that it ran out of beer, but the band were only paid \u00a330, which they immediately spent on a demo tape.",
      "\"I don't know how we did it,\" Rylance says. \"We were really, really poor for a long time.",
      "\"We kept going because we believed in it, but that's not a realistic prospect for a lot of people.",
      "\"If you don't have any money, you can't afford to make mistakes.\"",
      "Even now, the band need help funding their European tour. Last month, they accepted a grant from the UK's Music Export Growth Fund to help pay for visas and transport costs.",
      "\"I wouldn't be in Paris right now without that,\" Rylance admits. \"They match what we spend, and we're willing to invest as much as we can.\"",
      "That's where ADHD can come in handy. Rylance is relentlessly creative, always on the look-out for ways to promote the band. On the album, he even calls ADHD a \"neurospice\" that helps him \"see solutions before problems even arise\".",
      "To that end, he's got a plan to secure a second number one album this week. Since Friday, Lottery Winners have been hosting a pop-up shop in Leigh, with free live music every day and copies of KOKO for sale.",
      "\"I can promise you this, there isn't a single band who'll work harder than us,\" he says.",
      "To paraphrase his gran, they're keen on keeping on."

      "Members of the Shiv Sena party, which is led by Shinde, vandalised the hotel in Mumbai - the capital of Maharashtra - where the show was held.",
      "A police case was also registered against Kamra and politicians from the state's ruling coalition have asked him to apologise.",

      "\"But will the law be fairly and equally deployed against those who have decided that vandalism is the appropriate response to being offended by a joke?\" he added.",
      "Police arrested 12 people for the vandalism at the hotel, which housed a comedy club where the show was filmed. They were later released on bail.",
      "As the controversy raged, Shinde said he did not support the vandalism, but added that \"the other person should also maintain a certain standard\".",
      "\"There is freedom of expression. We understand satire. But there should be a limit,\" he told BBC Marathi.",
      "Kamra is a well-known name in the Indian comedy scene, with his political satire and stand-up shows getting millions of views on social media.",
      "In his latest show - called Naya Bharat (New India) - Kamra refers to Shinde's 2022 defection from the Shiv Sena party which triggered a major political crisis in the state.",
      "The move led to a split in the Shiv Sena - India's Election Commission later recognised Shinde's group as the \"real\" Shiv Sena. The party is now part of the governing coalition in Maharashtra along with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist Congress Party.",
      "In the show, Kamra sang a parody of a Bollywood song where he indirectly referred to Shinde as a traitor, outraging his supporters.",
      "It's not clear when the show was filmed at the hotel but the reactions this week were swift.",
      "After Shiv Sena workers ransacked the venue, the studio Habitat - which often hosted stand-up comedy shows - said it was shutting down until it figured out \"the best way to provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy\".",
      "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Mumbai's civic authorities, also demolished some structures at the hotel, citing alleged building violations.",
      "Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is from the BJP, criticised Kamra, asking him to apologise. \"None of us are against freedom of speech. We support satire or even political satire and we do not paint it differently,\" he said.",
      "Both he and Shinde accused Kamra of speaking on behalf of the opposition.",
      "A lawmaker from Shinde's party also said in a video that Shiv Sena workers would pursue Kamra across the country and he would be forced to leave India.",
      "In his statement, Kamra said he would not \"hide under [his] bed\", waiting for the outrage to die down.",
      "\"As far as I know, it is not against the law to poke fun at our leaders and the circus that is our political system,\" he said.",
      "Opposition leaders have supported Kamra.",
      "Uddhav Thackeray, chief of Shinde's former party - the Shiv Sena (UBT) - said Kamra had not done anything wrong.",
      "\"He stated the facts and voiced the public opinion,\" he added.",
      "Indian comedians have often faced legal action over comments and jokes. In 2021, Munawar Faruqui spent days in jail after being accused of hurting Hindu religious sentiments in jokes that - it turned out - he didn't actually crack.",
      "Actor and comedian Vir Das also faced outrage and police complaints after a show in the US where he described India as a country of two sides where people \"worship women during the day but gang rape them at night\"."

      "A classic car owned by the late French rock star Johnny Hallyday before he lost it at poker has sold for \u20ac132,000 ($143,000; \u00a3110,000) at auction.",
      "The Panther De Ville was given to him in 1975 by his then-wife, fellow singer Sylvie Vartan. Its custom-made fittings include mink seats, a gold disc on top of the grille and hubcaps carrying his initials.",
      "French auction house Osenat told the BBC that the vehicle was bought by a French man for \"a specific project, which he will discuss shortly\", and the buyer had to pay an additional buyer's premium of \u20ac26,400.",
      "Hallyday lost the car while playing poker with a friend in 1977.",
      "Osenat told the BBC that Hallyday reportedly tried to buy the vehicle back from the owner, but was dissuaded from doing so by his manager who cited limited finances.",
      "The Panther De Ville was a neo-classic luxury car with a 1930s-style design. It was produced in Britain from 1974 to 1985 and had a V12 Jaguar engine.",
      "Hallyday's yellow-and-black 1975 model was one of 69 classic cars sold by Osena in Fontainebleau, near Paris, on Monday. The auctioneers had expected the vehicle to fetch between between \u20ac55,000 and \u20ac80,000.",
      "The gold disc is inscribed with Hallyday's name. Vartan had it placed on top of the grille to celebrate the best-selling records he released in 1975.",
      "Hallyday was a renowned car enthusiast. But within two years, he was forced to part with the vehicle after losing a poker at a friend's home, Osenat's St\u00e9phane Pavot told the France Info website.",
      "However the lucky winner preferred sportier models and later exchanged it for a Ferrari whose owner was a true fan of Hallyday's, he added.",
      "Vartan and Hallyday divorced in 1980.",
      "Hallyday sold more than 110 million records and starred in a number of films over a career that spanned 57 years. He continued to tour until shortly before his death of lung cancer in 2017, aged 74."

      "But he was also concerned that his professional career might be over.",

      "Having returned to live touring, Meade had another challenge to face. Making his own music.",

      "\"I'd never thought I'd get back to playing with the band and writing my own music, being able to record it and being at a level that Alan McGee finds it worthy of releasing.\"",
      "This week he and the rest of Ocean Colour Scene kick off their latest tour in Leeds. The band whose hits include The Riverboat Song and The Day We Caught the Train will play two dates at Glasgow's 02 Academy on 15 and 16 April.",

      "To a sizeable portion of the nation, Clarke's 50-year stream of biting beat poetry and kitchen sink stand-up comedy should qualify him for national treasure status.",
      "He's horrified at the suggestion.",
      "\"I hate that,\" he shoots back. \"I think it sounds like you're knocking on heaven's door.",

      "One honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.",
      "Although not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM.",
      "It was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40.",

      "However, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.",

      "\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"",
      "Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.",
      "He said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".",
      "He said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".",
      "But the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".",
      "Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.",
      "Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.",
      "One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".",
      "Kosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.",
      "Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.",
      "\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.",
      "\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.",
      "\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"",
      "The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.",
      "And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.",
      "Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".",
      "\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.",
      "Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.",
      "Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.",
      "Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.",
      "Spence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.",
      "Streaming levy",
      "Figures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.",
      "Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.",
      "But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?",
      "In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".",
      "On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".",
      "\"We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,\" she said.",

    "summary": "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 could the lasting impact of the pandemic play a part?",
    "story": [
      "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".",
      "\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.",
      "Its owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\".",
      "\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"",
      "Mr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years.",
      "And according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".",
      "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.",
      "In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.",
      "\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.",
      "There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.",
      "But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did",
      "And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?",
      "Did the pandemic change a generation?",
      "For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.",
      "A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.",
      "Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".",
      "A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.",
      "Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"",
      "There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.",
      "Socialising less - or just differently?",
      "When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"",
      "Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".",
      "This rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.",
      "But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\"",
      "There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".",
      "\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"",
      "\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".",
      "A 'storm' coming for clubs?",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".",
      "Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.",
      "In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.",
      "\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"",
      "Mr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.",
      "If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.",
      "In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.",
      "Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".",
      "The company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.",
      "The places bucking the trend",
      "The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.",
      "But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.",
      "The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".",
      "There are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success.",
      "Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.",
      "Co-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"",
      "Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.",
      "\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance.",
      "Ultimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs.",
      "\"For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,\" he says.",
      "Why preserving clubs matters",
      "Cat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. \"Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,\" she says. \"Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.",
      "\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"",
      "Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.",
      "In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.",
      "The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.",
      "It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"",
      "And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.",
      "\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"",
      "But without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.",

      "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.",
      "Those discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.",
      "\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.",

      "Thorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.",
      "Chief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.",
      "But the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.",
      "\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"",
      "His parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.",
      "But Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.",
      "\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.",
      "\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"",
      "The writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.",
      "He found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.",
      "\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.",
      "\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.",
      "\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"",
      "These issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.",
      "On Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".",
      "\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.",
      "Thorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.",
      "\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.",
      "\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.",
      "\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"",
      "So what could more radical solutions be?",
      "This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.",
      "Violence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.",
      "Thorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".",
      "\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.",
      "He urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",
      "The writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.",
      "\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.",

    "summary": "The actor takes on the role of legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly - but insists it won't happen again.",
    "story": [
      "When Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success.",
      "There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan.",
      "\"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.",
      "\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\"",
      "Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus.",
      "The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book.",
      "The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced.",
      "\"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"",
      "The wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice.",
      "\" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says.",
      "\"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\"",
      "That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage.",
      "At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play.",
      "\"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"",
      "Born in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\".",
      "He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow.",
      "He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give.",
      "After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor.",
      "He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.",
      "More recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party.",
      "Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry.",
      "\"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea.",
      "\"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\"",
      "He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty).",
      "\"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"",
      "Normal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team.",
      "Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football.",
      "\"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\"",
      "It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive.",
      "\"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein \u2013 those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much.  Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism?",
      "\"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"",
      "He says he's delighted to be performing at the Royal Court, where audiences can tuck into a bowl of scouse in the auditorium before many of the shows. He says he's been told it compares with the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow.",
      "\"They let you know if they're getting bored. It's not bourgeois polite and that appeals to me.\"",
      "And he hopes it will appeal to fans of all football teams, and none.",
      "\"That's going to be the big test. My kids have a passing acquaintance. My boy is into football but my girls are not massively into it so it will be fascinating to see how they relate to it.\"",
      "And given his views on the low wages of subsidised theatre, and the fact that his family are coming to Liverpool to see the show, can we assume he won't be treading the boards again soon?",
      "\"No, it's a one-off for me. I can't afford it. The show might tour but with a 52-strong cast, I'm not sure if anyone can afford it.\"",
      "Red or Dead is at Liverpool's Royal Court from March 21st until April 19th."

      "Kalki's letter is addressed to her five-year-old daughter. In it, she offers advice for navigating pressures around body image and describes the ways unrealistic beauty standards have affected her personally.",
      "The actor, who lives in Goa in India with her husband Israeli musician Guy Hershberg and their daughter, says the inspiration for the letter came to her when, one day after school, the child came to her to say she didn't feel pretty.",
      "\"When they're so young, they're so perfect and you think, 'Oh my goodness. How is it possible that you could think you're not pretty?!'\" she says on the podcast.",

      "Born in Puducherry, India, to French parents, Kalki describes herself as a \"geeky introvert\" while growing up. As a teenager, she says, she was uncomfortable with her appearance, and pursuing a career on camera only intensified those feelings.",

      "Working in the film industry, she says she experienced a particular pressure to maintain a youthful appearance. Once, she says, a producer even suggested over lunch that she get dermal fillers for her wrinkles.",
      "\"He said, 'All you need is a little filler for your laughter lines.' I smiled and said, 'Well, I better stop smiling so much.' So I think my approach has been to deal with it with humour.\"",
      "Kalki says this happened when she was in her 30s and that she'd \"already lived enough life to not be affected\".",
      "\"But I know that 20-year-olds are being told this and they feel the pressure to go and change their face very early on.\"",
      "Kalki says she believes this pressure is worsened by the rise of social media. \"We all scrutinise [ourselves] and we all have these filters.\" And in her letter, she shares her fears of trying to protect her daughter from such scrutiny.",
      "She jokes that she even wondered about moving to Australia when she heard of the country's plans to ban smartphones for under-16s. \"That's how my mother-brain is working!\"",
      "Kalki is not the only celebrity to speak about the pressure to appear young that is faced by women in the public eye.",
      "Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown made headlines earlier this month for calling out journalists who have criticised the way she has aged.",
      "\"The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices is disturbing,\" the 21-year-old said in a three-minute video on her Instagram page.",
      "Dear Daughter podcast is the brainchild of Namulanta Kombo, a mother from Nairobi on a quest to create a \"handbook to life\" for her daughter, through the advice of parents from all over the world.",

      "Kalki's letter",
      "Dear daughter,",
      "One day after school you told me, \"Maman I'm not pretty.\" You were only four. I panicked and immediately responded with, \"What do you mean, of course you're pretty, you're as pretty as a butterfly, as bright as the sun.'' And you continued to say angrily, \"I'm not, I'm just not.\"",
      "In retrospect, I wish I had listened to you and been curious enough to ask you why you didn't feel pretty? You see I make mistakes too, my own insecurities and need to protect you took over and I didn't allow you the space to feel what you were feeling. Don't let others decide who you are. Not even me. You have far more experience at being you than anyone else. And no-one else can be a better you than you.",
      "Thankfully, I get second chances at being a better mother, and when a few weeks later you said \"I don't like myself\", I stopped my impulse to tell you what you were and listened. There was some silence and then you opened up about how you were having a hard time with some other children in school.",
      "I thought about how to ensure you know that beauty is not skin deep. The truth is sometimes you will feel ugly. I feel ugly sometimes even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful. And so now I have made it a point to tell you how beautiful you are, not when you're feeling bad about the way you look, and not when you're dressed your best, but when you are being the best versions of you.",
      "As you grow older I know that you will not always believe that you're beautiful because we live in a social world that has distorted beauty, that has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour, or a certain shape. These beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently.",
      "Remember that you are whole and that if you start to pick apart your little nose or your hairy brows or your not quite right ears, you will start to feel ugly, but that is only because you are forgetting the whole. An elephant is a beautiful animal, but pick it apart and it's got a long wrinkly nose, strange side glancing eyes, huge sticking out ears and a big fat stomach.",
      "Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life, they are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs, they are your friends for life.",
      "Dear daughter, do you know when I'll stop loving you? Never.",

    "story": [
      "British film critics have mostly panned Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, while US reviewers have been somewhat more positive.",
      "Chief film critic for The Times, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film \"mostly captivating\".",
      "Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role.",
      "Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%.",
      "The mostly good",
      "US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson.",
      "But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs.",
      "The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future.",
      "Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\"",
      "Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\"",
      "He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\".",
      "He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".",
      "Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\".",
      "Robbie Collin from The Telegraph gave the film a respectable three stars.",
      "\"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets \u2013 the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft \u2013 it really picks up,\" he said.",
      "He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\".",
      "The not so good",
      "Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner giving the film two stars.",
      "\"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says.",
      "He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\".",
      "Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.",
      "\"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.",
      "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\".",
      "He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\".",
      "The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet.",
      "He added: \"The new tunes, much like Zegler's performance, are watery and ineffectual, while the dramatic jeopardy is non-existent.",
      "\"It's hard not to see this as anything other than a crisis point for Disney, a studio that used to make flawless cinematic stories but now infantilises global audiences with sanctimonious life lessons culled from the corpses of their own murdered movies\".",
      "Tickets for the film, which reportedly cost more than $270m (\u00a3217m) to make, have only been put on presale in the last two weeks, relatively late for a big Disney film.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent gave it one star, declaring that \"Rachel Zegler deserves better than the lazy, visually repellent Snow White\".",
      "\"What's most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney's choices have become. With Snow White, they've finessed their formula \u2013 do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices,\" she concluded.",

    "summary": "The Care Quality Commission (CQC) report - published nine months after inspection - finds multiple breaches.",
    "story": [
      "The healthcare watchdog has apologised over delays to the publication of its report into maternity services in Nottingham, which is subject of the largest inquiry of its kind in the NHS.",
      "Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspections - in June and July - found seven breaches of regulation in safe care and treatment at Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust's two main hospitals.",
      "Overall, maternity services have been rated as requires improvement for being safe and well-led.",
      "Following criticism from Donna Ockenden, who is leading the review into maternity deaths and injuries at the trust, the CQC has admitted the report was not published \"as soon after the inspection as it should have done\".",
      "The CQC ask five key questions - are services safe, effective, caring, responsive to people's needs, and are they well-led?",
      "Following an inspection carried out on 18 June, 19 June and 3 July, the CQC's rating  for maternity services at both hospitals - the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) and City Hospital - being effective improved from requires improvement to good.",
      "Caring was re-rated as good, while a responsive rating was not included in the inspection and remains good.",
      "Following publication of its report, the CQC apologised for the delays, which senior midwife Ms Ockenden labelled \"unacceptable\" last month.",
      "\"Due to a large-scale transformation programme at CQC, this report [was] not published as soon after the inspection as it should have done,\" a CQC spokesperson said.",
      "\"The programme involved changes to the technology CQC uses but resulted in problems with the systems and processes rather than the intended benefits. The amount of time taken to publish this report falls far short of what people using services and the trust should be able to expect and the CQC apologises for this.\"",
      "The CQC said last year's inspection of the trust was prompted by concern from staff.",
      "The watchdog said the regulation breaches at the City Hospital related to infection control procedures, equipment safety, medicines and expressed milk storage.",
      "Breaches at the QMC concerned infection control procedures, equipment safety, and medicines management and storage.",
      "Inspectors noted learning opportunities were not always shared consistently with staff to promote good practice, and that low numbers of sufficiently qualified staff meant suitable resources were not always possible.",
      "Other issues were that people were not always confident about raising concerns, medicine storage was put at risk by inconsistent temperature regulation, and checks on emergency equipment were not always completed.",
      "An action plan focusing on these concerns has already been submitted by the trust, inspectors said.",
      "However, the CQC also found most people felt the environment was safe and could mostly access care when they needed it.",
      "Helen Rawlings, interim director of network operations in the Midlands at the CQC, said: \"It's clear that staff and leaders had worked hard to make some improvements, and since the inspection last year, leaders have assured us that further improvements have been made.",
      "\"We'll continue to monitor the trust to ensure that more changes are made and embedded so women, people using the service and their babies receive the safe care they have a right to expect.\"",
      "Anthony May, chief executive at the trust, added: \"I recognise that these inspections took place after colleagues in maternity services contacted the CQC directly. I want to thank them for their courage in speaking up.",
      "\"Importantly, the CQC found that women and families are treated with kindness and compassion, and that our environments are predominantly safe and deliver good outcomes.",
      "\"All breaches of regulation raised during the inspection have been addressed and we have provided the CQC with an action plan to assure them of compliance.",
      "\"We know that more must be done to improve the quality of care that women and families receive, but our communities can be assured that we are moving in the right direction.\"",
      "By the end of May this year, it is expected the maternity review of the trust will be examining 2,500 cases in which mothers or babies have died or been injured - the bulk of them between 2012 and the present day.",
      "The increased caseload now means the inquiry is working to a new timeline. Instead of the final report being published in September 2025, it is now due to be delivered in June 2026.",
      "Last month, the trust was handed the largest ever fine for failings in maternity care,   connected to the deaths of three babies - all within 14 weeks of each other - in 2021.",

      "By Rob Sissons, BBC East Midlands health correspondent",
      "There is a question as to how valuable this latest snapshot into Nottingham's pressured maternity units really is.",
      "It is a snapshot but a somewhat historic one.",
      "The CQC has apologised for the delay, blaming new computer systems.",
      "It nevertheless offers an evidenced snapshot from outside the hospital trust. The latest report acknowledges some progress but demonstrates a service still short of where it needs to be.",
      "It underlines what Donna Ockenden has always stressed - that turning around the troubled service was \"always going to be a marathon - not a sprint\". That will not come as a surprise to campaigning harmed families, who continue to push for more accountability.",

      "Some MPs expressed concern this was the same year as the next general election was due.",
      "Officials and civil servants have been advising Leadbeater on drafting amendments, including suggesting changes the government wants.",
      "A spokesman for Leadbeater said: \"Kim hopes and believes the service can be delivered more quickly if it becomes law later this year.\"",
      "Part of the reason for postponing the deadline is to allow time to set up training and systems for what would be an entirely new service. Changes made to the bill since MPs voted in favour, including a new commission and panel system to oversee application, have added to that.",
      "Leadbeater's new amendment changes the maximum implementation period from two years to four years. However if all the systems are ready before four years, assisted dying will go ahead earlier than the deadline.",
      "It is understood there is disagreement among ministers about the delay to implementation, with some believing it is a mistake.",
      "The government is officially neutral on the bill with many ministers supporting it.",
      "\"I cannot pretend that I'm not disappointed about extending the commencement period,\" Leadbeater told MPs on the committee tasked with scrutinising it.",
      "But she said the change created a \"four-year backstop\", adding: \"It doesn't say it cannot be implemented before then.\"",
      "Both MPs supportive of assisted dying and those opposed have expressed dismay.",
      "Tom Gordon, a Liberal Democrat MP in favour of the bill who sits on the committee, said other countries had implemented similar laws in much less time.",
      "\"The current law is failing terminally ill people, forcing them to suffer unbearably, travel abroad to die or risk their families facing police investigations. This amendment would prolong that suffering unnecessarily,\" he said.",
      "\"Delaying implementation risks pushing it beyond the next election, where it could be abandoned altogether.\"",
      "Jess Asato, a Labour MP who is against the bill, said: \"Putting an arbitrary timeline on such a complex issue was never a sensible way to make life or death legislation. This last-minute switch demonstrates again just how chaotic this whole process has been with substantial last-minute changes to core sections of the bill.\""

      "A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving the island if the legislation was introduced.",

      "Several members of the council agreed the issue could be given greater consideration during the drafting of the codes of practice and regulations implementing the proposed laws.",
      "Ultimately, the bishop's amendment was rejected, however changes made by MHKs to the council's revisions to the bill were accepted, allowing it to take its next steps towards implementation.",

      "The care received by 800 patients at a world-renowned NHS hospital is to be reviewed by expert clinicians after a specialist surgeon was suspended.",
      "Last month, it was reported the orthopaedic surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, had been suspended after concerns were raised by colleagues in October.",
      "An initial review by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) revealed treatment provided to nine children was \"below the standard we would expect\".",
      "The surgeon specialised in children, but also carried out emergency orthopaedic procedures on adults, the trust's chief executive Roland Sinker said.",
      "The review will assess the treatment given to 700 patients who had planned operations, and another 100 adult and child patients who had emergency treatment.",
      "Andrew Kennedy KC has been appointed by the trust to chair a panel of expert clinicians to undertake the external retrospective clinical review.",
      "He said: \"We will work tirelessly to examine all the cases within the scope of this review and to ensure that any shortcomings in care are identified as quickly as possible so that patients and families are fully informed and further consultations and treatment can be offered as appropriate.\"",
      "The trust confirmed concerns were raised as early as 2015 about the work of the surgeon, who is not being named for legal reasons.",
      "This was the subject of an external clinical review in 2016.",
      "The surgeon's clinical practice was restricted last year as a precautionary measure and they have been co-operating with the trust since their suspension, it added.",

      "He has just had an ultrasound scan at an NHS centre which sits between familiar High Street names. It is easy-to-reach healthcare - as convenient as popping out to the shops.",
      "This is part of the government's vision for the future of the NHS, soon to be set out in a 10-year plan. In England, ministers have already promised three big changes: shifting more services from hospitals into the community, focusing on preventing ill-health and making more use of new technology.",
      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",
      "There is another deep-rooted problem - a care system, supporting older and disabled people in the community, that is understaffed, underfunded and in crisis.",
      "Government critics say you cannot reform the NHS unless you reform social care, because it helps get people out of hospital more quickly and prevents some being admitted in the first place.",
      "An independent commission will begin looking at social care reform next month. There will be an interim report, but the final report is not due until 2028.",
      "Challenged on whether you can reform the NHS without changing social care, Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting tells Panorama that he doesn't need to wait for a review and plans to divert more NHS money into social care.",
      "\"I want to spend more of our resources through social care, because it delivers better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers,\" he says.",
      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",
      "\"It's about peace of mind. You're not waiting for appointments,\" he says.",
      "Liz Elfleet, medical imaging manager at Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust who helped set up the unit, describes this as the future of the NHS.",
      "\"We've seen around a 50% reduction in patients not attending for appointments,\" and the number of women accepting an invitation to have a routine breast screening appointment has risen \"from 43% to just under 80% over the three years,\" she says.",
      "The centre, which offers a range of health checks and scans, was opened in 2022 under the last Conservative government. The current Labour government says many more services will now move out of hospital into the community.",
      "In Barnsley, that is already happening. Part of another shopping centre is being converted into a second, large health hub. The project will be funded by the local council, regional mayor and a government grant.",
      "The leader of Labour-run Barnsley Council, Sir Steve Houghton, says the scanning centre has shown NHS facilities can boost town centres, and they estimate people spend about \u00a317 on average in local businesses when they visit.",
      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",
      "And the Green Party is calling for free social care.",
      "There are also questions over whether the NHS has the money to make all the changes the government is promising.",
      "It had a budget of \u00a3171bn in the financial year 2023-2024. It was also given an additional \u00a321bn over two years. NHS Providers, representing trusts across England, says most of that money has been eaten up by everyday pressures including wage rises, inflation and drug price increases.",
      "It warns these competing pressures make the change needed more difficult.",
      "The health and social care secretary agrees that it will not be easy, but says he cannot \"keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money into a system that is not set up to deliver best use of that money and best care for patients\"."

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "An inquest into the death of Ida Lock has shone light on repeat mistakes - and wider failures in certain hospitals across England",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Michael read this article",
      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

    "story": [
      "Proposed laws to give terminally ill adults on the Isle of Man the right to choose to end their own lives have been agreed by the Manx parliament.",
      "It means the bill can now be sent for Royal Assent, making it the first parliament in the British Isles to take this step.",
      "Under the provisions in the Assisted Dying Bill 2023, adults with a prognosis of 12 months or less to live would be given the right to choose to die.",
      "Those eligible would have to be over the age of 18, and have lived on the island for five years.",
      "The Royal Assent process is where the monarch formally approves a bill passed by parliament for it to become law.",
      "Members of the Legislative Council agreed to the latest changes made to the Assisted Dying Bill 2023 by the House of Keys at a sitting earlier.",
      "The proposed laws were brought forward in a Private Member's Bill by Ramsey MHK Alex Allinson.",
      "Those eligible must be terminally ill and \"reasonably expected\" to die within 12 months, over the age of 18, and be registered with an Isle of Man GP, and have been resident on the island for five years.",
      "The person must also have the the legal capacity to make the decision, and have the decision verified by two independent doctors.",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "The politician, who is also a GP, said he was \"hopeful\" it could become law later this year and that an assisted dying service could be in place by 2027.",
      "He said he had \"met many patients who have wanted this option\" and people on the Isle of Man had been trying to \"provide dignity and autonomy for those who are facing an imminent death\" for 20 years.",
      "But Gordon Macdonald from Care Not Killing, an alliance of groups that includes faith-based and pro-life organisations, described the vote as \"very sad day for islanders\".",
      "He said: \"In the small number of places that have legalised state assisted killing, we see the lives of vulnerable people put at risk, with safeguards and restrictions removed, while palliative care doesn't improve as some have wrongly claimed.\"",
      "Since its first reading in October 2023, the bill has been considered at length by the House of Keys, the publicly elected house, and the Legislative Council, which is the parliament's revising chamber.",
      "During the hours of debate, which included evidence from medical professionals, concerns over how strict the safeguards would be, the risk of coercion, and eligibility criteria for assisted dying were heard.",
      "Politicians also supported an opt-in system and conscientious objection option for health care professionals.",
      "A third of doctors who responded to an Isle of Man Medical Society survey in 2023 said they would consider leaving the island if the legislation was introduced.",
      "Allinson said he understood the concerns of those opposed to the move and the implementation of the law \"would involve more consultation, more guidelines, more safeguards and more parliamentary debates in terms of the underlying regulations and secondary legislation\".",
      "He said while the legislation would probably \"only be used by a very small number of people\", but for them it was a \"very important step forward, in terms of autonomy and choice at the end of your life\".",
      "Chief executive of Dignity in Dying Sarah Wootton said it was \"a historic moment for compassion in the Isle of Man and for the whole of the British Isles\".",
      "Vicky Christian, chairman of My Death, My Decision Isle of Man said she was \"incredibly proud that in the debate \"compassion and evidence have prevailed\".",
      "In February, a majority of changes to the 15-clause bill by the upper chamber were agreed by the House of Keys, but members rejected the council's call to reduce the residency criteria from five years to one.",
      "A proposed change that would have seen the medical professional overseeing a death not allowed to leave the patient alone at all during the process was also thrown out.",
      "'Nuances'",
      "During Tuesday's debate, a bid by the island's bishop the Right Reverend Patricia Hillas to have that revised to allow for the person to express a wish to die alone, and allow for the medical professional to \"not necessarily\" be in the same room as the patient.",
      "Rob Mercer MLC said that amendment threw up the \"difficulties of handling the nuances of a person's final wishes in primary legislation\".",
      "Several members of the council agreed the issue could be given greater consideration during the drafting of the codes of practice and regulations implementing the proposed laws.",
      "Ultimately, the bishop's amendment was rejected, however changes made by MHKs to the council's revisions to the bill were accepted, allowing it to take its next steps towards implementation.",
      "Bringing the debate to a close, Mercer said for those who still had concerns about the bill the latest step was \"just the end of the beginning\".",
      "\"There is a huge amount of work and effort still to go before this bill can become operational,\" he added",

      "Questioned on BBC Radio 5 Live on whether unprotected departments would face cuts, the PM said ministers were \"looking across the board\", but he wanted to challenge government to be more efficient.",
      "Rachel Reeves has confirmed civil service departments will be asked to cut 15% from their budgets, but there is political unease among Labour MPs about the scale of cuts to departments, which the chancellor will outline in her statement on Wednesday.",
      "It comes after the government unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir said the government was \"looking across the board\" at spending, when asked by the BBC whether cuts would be announced for departments whose spending is not protected, such as the Ministry of Justice.",
      "\"At the budget last year we made some record investments, and we're not going to undo that,\" he added, pointing to increased NHS spending.",
      "He said: \"We're essentially asking businesses across the country to be more efficient, to look at AI and tech in the way that they do their business.",
      "\"I want the same challenge in government, which is 'why shouldn't we be more efficient?', so we will be looking there and in one or two other places.\"",
      "The PM was asked by the BBC later if he would consider changing the government's fiscal rules and responded: \"No, because we had to stabilise the economy, which is what we did with the Budget.\"",
      "He added: \"The difference is that the global situation has changed - I think most people would understand that in the last few weeks and months the international insecurity has got very real - that does impact domestically.\"",
      "The chancellor's rules, which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy, are that day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing; and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029/30.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said it was the chancellor's decisions that were the cause of sluggish growth forecasts, leading to the imposition of cuts.",
      "\"We wouldn't be here because we would not have put those confidence-destroying taxes on the economy,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"We would have made different decisions, tackled welfare reform earlier - she's doing that now but if it's a moral mission of this government, why didn't they do it nine months ago?\"",
      "Welfare budget",
      "Reeves' plan for major money-saving from the welfare budget comes on top of her decision to axe the universal provision of winter fuel payments and only give them to the poorest pensioners.",
      "She told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that government running costs would be cut, with savings made from back office and administrative roles rather than front-line services.",
      "Last month, the government cut the international aid budget to boost defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, as leaders across Europe looked to overhaul defence policies over fears the US could make a deal with Russia to end the Ukraine war which leaves the continent vulnerable.",
      "Sir Keir and US President Donald Trump spoke about progress on an economic deal between the UK and US on Sunday night, Downing Street said.",
      "It comes as reports that a digital services tax on tech giants could be slashed or abolished.",
      "On Monday, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander denied the government was signalling a return towards an austerity model.",
      "Challenged on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Alexander highlighted that Labour had increased public spending in its first budget in October.",
      "\"We have to take some really very difficult decisions and in terms of welfare we will always make sure that there is a system that provides a safety net for the most vulnerable,\" she said.",
      "\"We're investing over \u00a320bn more in the NHS and we've seen waiting lists coming down in hospitals now for the fifth month in a row.",
      "\"The Office for Budget Responsibility last year at the time of the budget said it was one of the most expansionist budgets ever, of all time, so we are not returning to austerity.\"",
      "Civil Service unions have warned that services could deteriorate with the loss of jobs.",
      "Paul Novak, the general secretary of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), told BBC Radio 4's World at One that \"there are always efficiencies\" to make in the civil service.",
      "But if the government were \"serious about making public services work and delivering for people who make those services work then you've got to look at investing in those services,\" Mr Novak said.",
      "He argued \"you'd be hard pressed to find anybody in the civil service or the public sector who say there is a lot of fat to be trimmed\".",
      "The TUC, which helps represent just under 190,000 civil servants in Public and Commercial Services Union, were a \"long way\" from strike action on proposed changes, Mr Novak said.",
      "The UK civil service workforce is the largest it has been for nearly 20 years, with 548,000 employees, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.",

      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",

      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",

      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

    "story": [
      "\"The world has changed\" is the mantra we are hearing from the government.",
      "It is a phrase designed to explain and justify the chancellor's argument on Wednesday in what is known as her Spring Statement.",
      "The Conservatives are branding it an \"emergency Budget\", which ministers insist is nonsense, but it is certainly true it is a bigger event than it was expected to be just a few months ago.",
      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",
      "The backdrop is pretty bleak.",
      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",
      "Add to that the wild unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, the looming prospect of tariffs and the vast uncertainty over Ukraine's future and European security.",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",

      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",

    "summary": "On social media a self-proclaimed earthquake predictor says he can forecast big shakes, but experts say it's pure luck.",
    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Ms Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Ms Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Ms Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Ms Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Ms Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "Thousands evacuate Santorini as more earthquakes strike island",
      "The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.",
      "But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.",
      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Ms Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Ms Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

      "\"Great British Energy's first major project will be to help our vital public institutions save hundreds of millions on bills to reinvest on the frontline,\" he added.",
      "The government also hopes that the project, to provide solar panels for 200 schools and 200 hospitals, will reduce the use of fossil fuels across public property and help achieve its long-term climate goals.",
      "This is not the first time such a project has existed - the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, launched under the previous Conservative government, has been running for more than four years and distributed close to \u00a33bn for green technologies.",
      "This project in the first instance will target less than 1% of schools.",
      "But Alex Green, head of Let's Go Zero - a national campaign to reduce the climate impact of schools - said it was a welcome first move.",

      "In 2022, the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) had said that a third of its leaders were predicting a budget deficit following a spike in energy costs.",
      "Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said schools wanted to install solar panels as they provided cheaper energy than paying for gas, but the upfront cost could often be prohibitive.",
      "\"This announcement is therefore welcome and a step in the right direction. In the longer term, this should also help schools manage energy bills, which have been a source of enormous financial pressure in recent years,\" he said.",

      "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.",
      "Data leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.",
      "The BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.",
      "Ecopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.",
      "The company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.",
      "The huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.",

      "One local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.",
      "In places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.",

      "Ecopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.",
      "In response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.",
      "He joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".",
      "Mr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"",
      "He left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.",
      "One database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.",
      "Ecopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.",
      "Mr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".",
      "\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.",
      "The BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.",

      "He also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.",
      "However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.",
      "Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".",
      "The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.",
      "It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.",
      "The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.",
      "The fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.",
      "She said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.",
      "It is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.",
      "A 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.",
      "Mr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.",
      "\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.",
      "Mr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.",
      "She said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.",
      "The fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.",
      "Asked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".",
      "\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.",
      "Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.",
      "Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.",
      "Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.",
      "But he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.",
      "Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.",
      "Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.",
      "\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.",
      "He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.",
      "Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.",
      "The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.",
      "Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.",
      "He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.",
      "\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.",
      "\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"",
      "And Ms Vel\u00e1squez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.",
      "\"If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,\" she said. \"If we speak and report, we are killed\u2026  And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.\"",

      "\"Great British Energy's first major project will be to help our vital public institutions save hundreds of millions on bills to reinvest on the frontline,\" he added.",
      "The government also hopes that the project, to provide solar panels for 200 schools and 200 hospitals, will reduce the use of fossil fuels across public property and help achieve its long-term climate goals.",
      "This is not the first time such a project has existed - the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, launched under the previous Conservative government, has been running for more than four years and distributed close to \u00a33bn for green technologies.",
      "This project in the first instance will target less than 1% of schools.",
      "But Alex Green, head of Let's Go Zero - a national campaign to reduce the climate impact of schools - said it was a welcome first move.",

      "Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said schools wanted to install solar panels as they provided cheaper energy than paying for gas, but the upfront cost could often be prohibitive.",

    "story": [
      "Twenty million trees will be planted and 2,500 hectares (6,178 acres) of new woodland created in the west of England as part of a \"national forest\" drive, the government has announced.",
      "The Western Forest will be made up of new and existing woodlands across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, the Cotswolds and the Mendips as well as in urban areas such as Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester.",
      "It will be the first of three new national forests promised by the government to help meet a legally-binding target of achieving 16.5% woodland cover in England by 2050.",
      "However, with only 10% cover achieved so far, environmental groups have warned much more needs to be done to meet tree-planting targets.",
      "The most recent research shows the total area of woodland across the whole of the UK is currently estimated to be 3.28m hectares.",
      "That represents 13% of the total land area of the UK but in England just 10% is woodland.",
      "Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 hectares of woodland to be planted every year.",
      "The latest annual figures show about 21,000 hectares were planted, with the vast majority in Scotland and just 5,500 hectares in England.",
      "Andy Egan, head of conservation policy at the Woodland Trust, said there had been \"significant progress\" on tree planting but that there was still \"much more to do\" to meet the UK's targets.",
      "He said maintaining government funding was essential.",
      "\"Successful tree planting and ongoing management needs long-term grant support,\" he said.",
      "\"A tough public spending environment could risk undoing much of the good work.\"",
      "Alex Stone, chief executive of the Forest of Avon Trust, which leads the partnership behind the Western Forest project, said there were some areas in the region that currently had only 7% of land covered by trees.",
      "\"This is about bringing those areas up so we have trees where we really need them,\" she said.",
      "\"What we are aiming to do with the Western Forest is get to 20% of canopy cover by 2050 and, in five priority areas, we are looking at getting above 30%.\"",
      "The scheme will particularly target urban areas, including Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester.",
      "The government said it would be putting \u00a37.5m of public money into the forest over the next five years.",
      "It said the project would not only help the UK's drive to net zero but would also promote economic growth and create jobs in the region.",
      "Mary Creagh, minister for nature, said she hoped the Western Forest would also \"make a huge difference\" to water quality, flood resilience and to wildlife as well as bringing nature \"closer to people\" in the region.",
      "But she conceded there was much more to do in order to hit England's national tree-planting target.",
      "\"I am absolutely confident that we can get to where we need to get to,\" she said.",
      "\"Projects like this give me hope and confidence that, with everybody pulling together, working with the public sector and the private sector, we can do it.\"",

    "summary": "Experts say using even such a privacy-focussed platform for national security matters is very unusual.",
    "story": [
      "The free messaging app Signal has made headlines after the White House confirmed it was used for a secret group chat between senior US officials.",
      "The editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to the group where plans for a strike against the Houthi group in Yemen were discussed.",
      "It has caused a significant backlash, with Democrat Senate leader Chuck Schumer calling it \"one of the most stunning\" military intelligence leaks in history and calling for an investigation.",
      "But what actually is Signal - and how secure or otherwise were the senior politicians' communications on it?",
      "The security app",
      "Signal has estimated 40-70 million monthly users - making it pretty tiny compared to the biggest messaging services, WhatsApp and Messenger, which count their customers in the billions.",
      "Where it does lead the way though is in security.",
      "At the core of that is end-to-end encryption (E2EE).",
      "Simply put, it means only the sender and the receiver can read messages - even Signal itself cannot access them.",
      "A number of other platforms also have E2EE -  including WhatsApp - but Signal's security features go beyond this.",
      "For example, the code that makes the app work is open source - meaning anybody can check it to make sure there are no vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.",
      "Its owners say it collects far less information from its users, and in particular does not store records of usernames, profile pictures, or the groups people are part of.",
      "There is also no need to dilute these features to make more money: Signal is owned by the Signal Foundation, a US-based non-profit, which relies on donations rather than ad revenue.",
      "\"Signal is the gold standard in private comms,\" said its boss Meredith Whittaker in a post on X after the US national security story became public.",
      "'Very, very unusual'",
      "That \"gold standard claim\" is what makes Signal appealing to cybersecurity experts and journalists, who often use the app.",
      "But even that level of security is considered insufficient for very high level conversations about extremely sensitive national security matters.",
      "That is because there is a largely unavoidable risk to communicating via a mobile phone: it is only as secure as the person that uses it.",
      "If someone gains access to your phone with Signal open - or if they learn your password - they'll be able to see your messages.",
      "And no app can prevent someone peeking over your shoulder if you are using your phone in a public space.",
      "Trump backs top adviser who accidentally added journalist to secret air strike chat",
      "Why is it a problem if Yemen strike plans shared on Signal?",
      "Data expert Caro Robson, who has worked with the US administration, said it was \"very, very unusual\" for high ranking security officials to communicate on a messaging platform like Signal.",
      "\"Usually you would use a very secure government system that is operated and owned by the government using very high levels of encryption,\" she said.",
      "She said this would typically mean devices kept in \"very secure government controlled locations\".",
      "The US government has historically used a sensitive compartmented information facility (Scif - pronounced \"skiff\") to discuss matters of national security.",
      "A Scif is an ultra-secure enclosed area in which personal electronic devices are not allowed.",
      "\"To even access this kind of classified information, you have to be in a particular room or building repeatedly swept for bugs or any listening devices,\" said Ms Robson.",
      "Scifs can be found in places ranging from military bases to the homes of officials.",
      "\"The whole system is massively encrypted and secured using the government's own highest standards of cryptography,\" she said.",
      "\"Especially when defence is involved.\"",
      "Encryption and records",
      "There's another issue tied to Signal that has raised concerns - disappearing messages.",
      "Signal, like many other messaging apps, allows its users to set messages to disappear after a set period of time.",
      "The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg said some of the messages in the Signal group he was added to disappeared after a week.",
      "This may violate laws around record-keeping - unless those using the app forwarded on their messages to an official government account.",
      "This is also far from the first row involving E2EE",
      "Various administrations have wanted to create a so-called backdoor into messaging services that use it so they can read messages they think might pose a national security threat.",
      "Apps including Signal and WhatsApp have previously fought attempts to create such a backdoor, saying it would eventually be used by bad actors.",
      "Signal threatened to pull the app from the UK in 2023 if it was undermined by lawmakers.",

      "Apple ended up pulling the feature in the UK altogether after the government demanded access to data protected in this way by the tech giant.",
      "The legal case is ongoing.",
      "But, as this controversy shows, no level of security or legal protection matters if you simply share your confidential data with the wrong person.",

      "Mr Baszucki also stressed the company took protecting its users extremely seriously  and pointed out that \"tens of millions\" of people have \"amazing experiences\" on what is the UK's most popular gaming site for children aged eight to 12.",
      "Hundreds of people got in touch with the BBC after reading his comments: many said parents needed to take more responsibility, or highlighted how safe and enjoyable Roblox was for their children.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "story": [
      "A Norwegian man has filed a complaint after ChatGPT falsely told him he had killed two of his sons and been jailed for 21 years.",
      "Arve Hjalmar Holmen has contacted the Norwegian Data Protection Authority and demanded the chatbot's maker OpenAI is fined.",
      "It is the latest example of so-called \"hallucinations\", where artificial intelligence (AI) systems invent information and present it as fact.",
      "Mr Holmen says this hallucination is damaging to him.",
      "\"Some think that there is no smoke without fire - the fact that someone could read this output and believe it is true is what scares me the most,\" he said.",
      "OpenAI says this case relates to a previous version of ChatGPT and it has since updated its models.",
      "Mr Holmen was given the false information after he used ChatGPT to search for: \"Who is Arve Hjalmar Holmen?\"",
      "The response he got from ChatGPT included: \"Arve Hjalmar Holmen is a Norwegian individual who gained attention due to a tragic event.",
      "\"He was the father of two young boys, aged 7 and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.\"",
      "Mr Holmen said the chatbot got their age gap roughly right, suggesting it did have some accurate information about him.",
      "Digital rights group Noyb, which has filed the complaint on his behalf, says the answer ChatGPT gave him is defamatory and breaks European data protection rules around accuracy of personal data.",
      "Noyb said in its complaint that Mr Holmen \"has never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen\".",
      "ChatGPT carries a disclaimer which says: \"ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.\"",
      "Noyb says that is insufficient.",
      "\"You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true,\" Noyb lawyer Joakim S\u00f6derberg said.",
      "OpenAI said in a statement: \"We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations.",
      "\"While we're still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.\"",
      "Hallucinations are one of the main problems computer scientists are trying to solve when it comes to generative AI.",
      "These are when chatbots present false information as facts.",
      "Earlier this year, Apple suspended its Apple Intelligence news summary tool in the UK after it hallucinated false headlines and presented them as real news.",
      "Google's AI Gemini has also fallen foul of hallucination - last year it suggested sticking cheese to pizza using glue, and said geologists recommend humans eat one rock per day.",
      "It is not clear what it is in the large language models - the tech which underpins chatbots - which causes these hallucinations.",
      "\"This is actually an area of active research. How do we construct these chains of reasoning? How do we explain what what is actually going on in a large language model?\" said Simone Stumpf, professor of responsible and interactive AI at the University of Glasgow.",
      "Prof Stumpf says that can even apply to people who work behind the scenes on these types of models.",
      "\"Even if you are more involved in the development of these systems quite often, you do not know how they actually work, why they're coming up with this particular information that they came up with,\" she told the BBC.",
      "ChatGPT has changed its model since Mr Holmen's search in August 2024, and now searches current news articles when it looks for relevant information.",
      "Noyb told the BBC Mr Holmen had made a number of searches that day, including putting his brother's name into the chatbot and it produced \"multiple different stories that were all incorrect\".",
      "They also acknowledged the previous searches could have influenced the answer about his children, but said large language models are a \"black box\" and OpenAI \"doesn't reply to access requests, which makes it impossible to find out more about what exact data is in the system.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.",
      "To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.",
      "But he got much more attention than he bargained for.",
      "Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.",
      "The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.",
      "Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.",
      "\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.",
      "Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.",
      "Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.",
      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",
      "Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.",
      "Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.",
      "And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .",
      "The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.",
      "In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.",
      "GM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".",
      "In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.",
      "Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.",
      "Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.",
      "But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",
      "So what's next?",
      "Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.",
      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",
      "\"There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,\" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.",
      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

      "Usha Vance had planned to travel to the Danish territory on a cultural visit before her husband announced his plans. Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz is also set to visit this week on a separate trip.",
      "Officials in Greenland have fiercely criticised the planned visits as disrespectful.",
      "Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.",
      "It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest and a military presence there since World War Two.",
      "The Pituffik Space Base, located in the north-west of Greenland, supports missile warning, air defence and space surveillance missions.",
      "In a video posted on social media platform X, Vance said there was a lot of excitement around his wife's trip to Greenland. He is joining her because he \"didn't want her to have all that fun by herself\".",
      "He said the visit to the military installation was to check on the island's security, as \"a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland\".",
      "He added that the Trump administration wants to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland\", and that the United States and Denmark have ignored it for \"far too long\".",

      "Dr Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of Polar Research and Policy Initiative think tank, based in London, criticised the visit.",
      "He said it is \"highly unusual\" that a high-level delegation of US officials are visiting Greenland without being invited, especially after a national election in the country, where the parties are still in talks to form the next government.",
      "The US' interest in Greenland's security, given its strategic importance, makes sense, he said. But he added that it is \"inexplicable\" for Washington DC to have taken such an aggressive approach, especially in light of Trump's comments about acquiring the territory.",
      "\"Disrespecting the people of Greenland by saying the US will acquire it 'one way or the other' is unhelpful and counter-productive as a tactic,\" he added.",
      "According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark. But an opinion survey in January suggested an even greater number rejected the idea of becoming part of the US.",

    "story": [
      "Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was called \"a gold digger\" and \"a murderer\". She was slut-shamed and spent 27 days in prison after a hate-filled vicious media campaign in 2020 alleged she had been involved in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput.",
      "Now, India's federal investigators have told a court that Rajput, a rising star in India's popular Hindi film industry, died by suicide and that neither Chakraborty nor her family had a role in his death.",
      "In a statement shared with the BBC, senior lawyer Satish Maneshinde, who fought Chakraborty's case, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had \"thoroughly investigated every aspect of the case from all angles and closed it\".",
      "The findings have been presented in a special court in Mumbai, which will now decide whether to close the case or to order further investigation.",
      "Mr Maneshinde said Chakraborty went through \"untold miseries\" and was jailed \"for no fault of hers\".",
      "\"The false narrative in the social media and electronic media was totally uncalled for,\" he said, calling on media bosses to \"reflect upon what they did\".",
      "\"Innocent people were hounded and paraded before the media and investigative authorities. I hope this does not repeat in any case.\"",
      "Feminist lawyer Payal Chawla, meanwhile, described the \"misogynistic narrative surrounding Chakraborty\" as \"deeply troubling\" and said the case \"should serve as a cautionary reminder of the perils of being judgmental\".",
      "Chakraborty herself has offered no comment since news of CBI wanting to close the case broke at the weekend. On Monday, she was seen visiting a temple along with her brother and father - who were also named in a police complaint filed over Rajput's death.",
      "Perhaps the only sign that the family feel vindicated comes from her brother Showik - who spent three months in prison before being freed on bail. He shared a photo with Rhea and the caption \"Satyamev Jayate\" - Sanskrit for \"truth alone prevails\".",
      "Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on 14 June 2020. Mumbai police said the 34-year-old had mental health issues, for which he was under treatment, and appeared to have taken his own life.",

      "\"Still struggling to face my emotions... an irreparable numbness in my heart\u2026 I will never come to terms with you not being here anymore,\" she later wrote on social media about her grief.",
      "But within weeks, the actress found herself at the centre of a firestorm after Rajput's father lodged a police complaint, accusing Chakraborty of stealing his son's money and contributing to his suicide. He also denied that his son had any mental health issues.",

      "And Chakraborty became the subject of misogynistic abuse, with trolls calling her a \"witch\", a \"fortune huntress\", a \"mafia moll\" and \"sex bait to trap rich men\". She received rape and death threats.",
      "Some of India's most high-profile television hosts dedicated their entire shows to discussing the case, describing her as a \"manipulative\" woman who \"performed black magic\" and \"drove Sushant to suicide\".",
      "A video that went viral at the time showed a prominent news anchor hysterically gesticulating and accusing Chakraborty of being \"a druggie\". Another channel had a female anchor walk in on the live set, claiming she had \"a bagful of documents\" that could prove the actress's guilt.",
      "The vicious hate campaign continued until Chakraborty was arrested three months after Rajput's death.",

      "\"A defamation case can go on for a decade and she would possibly get an apology at the end of it. So would she even bother to do that?\"",
      "According to Ms Bhandare, Chakraborty \"became expendable in the pursuit of a juicy story\" since she \"was not a big name and had no powerful people backing her in the film industry\".",
      "What happened, the columnist continued, \"was in keeping with the traditional Indian thinking\" to blame the female partner left behind, and also highlighted the \"dark side of social media, which tends to find a villain and then sets about demolishing their reputation\".",
      "Some of the videos of prominent news anchors making slanderous comments against Chakraborty have now resurfaced, and are being shared extensively on social media. Many people, including some of the actress's Bollywood colleagues, are demanding that the presenters apologise to her.",

      "An FBI webpage, which on Monday showed a $10 million dollar bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani, has now been updated to remove the reward offer.",

      "The two other people arrested on suspicion of voluntary homicide and concealment of a corpse are adult children of Emile's grandparents, prosecutors said in a statement.",
      "The grandparents' lawyer, Isabelle Colombani, told AFP on Tuesday morning that she had no comment, having \"only just heard\" about the development.",

      "But prosecutors at the time said that the remains offered no further clues as to the cause of Emile's death, adding that it could have been as a result of \"a fall, manslaughter or murder\".",
      "Tuesday's sudden twist, in a case that seemed to have gone cold, made headlines in France, where the search for Emile has been extensively covered by the media. When the toddler disappeared, dozens of journalists flocked to Haut-Vernet, often outnumbering the 25 residents of the tiny Alpine hamlet.",
      "The last sighting of Emile had been on 8 July 2023, when two neighbours saw him walking by himself on the only street in the village.",
      "Police were alerted by his grandmother shortly afterwards. Hundreds of people joined police, sniffer dogs and the military in a search the following day.",
      "Initially, French reports focused on Emile's grandfather - but his lawyer said that she hoped investigators would not \"waste too much time on him to the detriment of other lines of inquiry\".",
      "Emile's remains were found days after police summoned 17 people - including members of Emile's family, neighbours and witnesses - to reconstruct the final moments before the boy disappeared.",
      "The toddler's funeral took place in February this year. Soon after, his maternal grandparents said that \"silence had made space for truth\" and that they could no longer \"live without answers\".",
      "\"We have had 19 months without a single certainty. We need to understand, we need to know,\" they said.",
      "In a statement, Aix-en-Provence chief prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon said that Tuesday's arrests were the result of investigations carried out over recent months, and that police were examining \"several spots in the area\".",

      "The comments by Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, follow recent fighting between the army and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, at a military base in the northern town of Nasir in oil-rich Upper Nile State.",
      "Since the White Army overran the base, there had been persistent aerial bombardment causing \"significant casualties and horrific burns\", he said.",
      "\"A conflict would erase all the hard-won gains made since the 2018 peace deal was signed,\" he warned.",
      "\"It would devastate not only South Sudan but the entire region, which simply cannot afford another war,\" Mr Haysom said.",
      "The government has not responded to the barrel bomb allegations.",
      "President Salva Kiir and his rival Vice-President Riek Machar agreed in August 2018 to end a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people.",

      "In early March, several of Machar's most senior allies were arrested by security forces, which his allies called a \"grave violation\" of the peace deal.",
      "This followed the clashes between the military and the White Army, which fought alongside Machar during the civil war that erupted in 2013 - not long after the country had gained its independence from Sudan.",
      "\"In retaliation, communities across Upper Nile are being subjected to persistent aerial bombardment using devices, barrel bombs, allegedly containing a highly flammable liquid that acts as an accelerant on explosion,\" Mr Haysom said.",
      "\"These indiscriminate attacks on civilians are causing significant casualties and horrific injuries, especially burns.\"",
      "Such allegations were first made last week by local leaders in Upper Nile.",
      "James Gatluak Lew, Nasir county commissioner, told the BBC that state forces and their allies had carried out \"chemical bombardments\".",
      "Local media reported that ethyl acetate, a highly flammable chemical compound, was found at the attack sites.",
      "In an earlier interview with the BBC, Edmund Yakani, the head of a local non-governmental organisation, said he had heard similar reports.",
      "Eyewitnesses, including local community leaders and business informants, had told his Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation (CEPO) about the use of \"unusual weapons\", he said.",
      "Government spokesman Michael Makuei confirmed there had been a military operation in Upper Nile last week, insisting \"the bombardment was strictly against White Army positions and did not harm civilians\".",
      "But Mr Haysom said civilians, including women and children, had been greatly affected, with an estimated 63,000 people forced to flee their homes.",
      "He added that such violence was escalating as the country drew closer to elections, expected next year.",
      "\"Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\" he said.",
      "The UN mission, which oversees an estimated 18,000 peacekeepers in South Sudan, was engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy to try and prevent a return to civil war, Mr Haysom added.",
      "Meanwhile, Machar has accused neighbouring Uganda of violating the UN arms embargo on South Sudan by conducting airstrikes in the country.",
      "In a letter seen by the Reuters news agency and addressed to the UN, the African Union and the regional bloc Igad, Machar said Uganda's military intervention in South Sudan had violated the peace deal.",

    "story": [
      "Burundi's president has told the BBC he has seen \"credible intelligence\" that Rwanda plans to attack his country.",
      "\u00c9variste Ndayishimiye also said that Rwanda had tried to launch a coup a decade ago in Burundi, akin to \"what it's doing in the Democratic Republic of Congo\" now.",

      "Rwanda has also denied links to the resurgent Red Tabara rebel group, which President Ndayishimiye says is a proxy force similar to the M23 and is being supported by Rwanda to destabilise Burundi.",

      "\"But now we don't have any plans to attack Rwanda. We want to resolve that problem by dialogue.\"",
      "At the heart of Ndayishimiye's comments was a call for peace and the full implementation of an agreement between the two nations - a peace deal that had been signed in previous years but, according to Burundi, had not been honoured by Rwanda.",
      "\"The people who did the 2015 coup [were] organised by Rwanda, and then they ran away. Rwanda organised them - it went to recruit the youth in Mahama camp. It trained them, it gave them arms, it financed them. They are living in the hand of Rwanda,\" he alleges.",

      "While the situation with Rwanda is critical, it is not Burundi's only problem.",

      "\"External forces are responsible for perpetuating this conflict. They do not want peace in the DRC because they want to continue looting its resources,\" Ndayishimiye told the BBC.",
      "\"The crisis in the DRC is not about the people - it is about the minerals.\"",
      "The solution, he argues, is to bring all parties to the table, including \"all opposition political parties and armed groups\", who must \"sit together and see together how they can create the best future for all citizens\".",
      "But in his view it all depends on whether Rwanda will show willing.",
      "\"The problem between Rwanda and the DRC is a small problem, they can resolve it without killing people. For example, I hear that Rwanda says it is going there [to DRC] because of the FDLR [a Rwandan rebel group accused of links to the 1994 genocide].",

      "\"They can go back, we will not refuse them to go back. But when they are here, they are as our visitors. If a visitor comes your house - it's you who chooses the room where he will stay.",
      "\"Even the food they have is what we share. They can't say I will eat meat when you are eating fish.\"",
      "For the war to end and the Congolese to achieve lasting peace, Ndayishimiye says  \u2060the mandate of international forces in DR Congo should be expanded so that they can engage the rebels.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has been gifted a new portrait from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin - while trashing an existing painting of him as \"truly the worst\".",
      "The new portrait has not been shown publicly. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described it as a \"personal gift\", adding that only Putin himself could disclose further details.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump took to Truth Social to criticise an earlier picture of him that hung in the Colorado State Capitol building until it was removed on Monday.",
      "The US president has paid close attention to cultivating his image, and made headlines in January by unveiling an official portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous.",
      "Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed receipt of the new work from Moscow, saying he had been asked to transport it back to Washington.",
      "He described the work as a painting - a \"beautiful portrait\" by a \"leading Russian artist\" - but gave no further critique. Trump was \"clearly touched by it\", he added.",
      "The gift was confirmed by Peskov, as American and Russian negotiators again sat down for talks in Saudi Arabia as part of Trump's drive to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "The gift highlights the diplomatic thaw between the two nations after Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "In an interview, Witkoff - who met Putin 10 days ago - said the Russian president had been \"gracious\". Putin told him, he added, that he had prayed for Trump after an assassination attempt against him last year.",
      "That attempt on Trump's life - which took place during a rally in Pennsylvania - gave rise to perhaps the most iconic image of him ever produced.",
      "AP photographer Evan Vucci caught the moment that Trump, with a bloody ear, held up a defiant fist and told supporters to \"fight, fight, fight\". That image was further mythologised by Trump, who used it to adorn the cover of a book.",

      "'Purposefully distorted'",
      "Trump is yet to publicly comment on the image that was sent by Putin - but he left no doubt of the kind of portraiture he liked and disliked when delivering his views on the Colorado image.",
      "The painting, which was presented to the building in 2019, was \"purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before\", he wrote on Truth Social on Monday morning.",
      "That was unlike the same artist's depiction of Barack Obama, Trump wrote. Offering rare praise for his predecessor, Trump said Obama looked \"wonderful\" in his own portrait by the same artist, English-born Sarah Boardman.",
      "Trump reportedly lost up to 30lb (13.6kg) during last year's presidential campaign. He told reporters he had been \"so busy\" he had not \"been able to eat very much\".",
      "The Republican also used the portrait to make a political point - describing Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, as \"radical\" and \"extremely weak on crime\".",
      "But the portrait had nothing to do with Polis, US media pointed out. It was instead the result of a crowdfunding campaign that was launched by a Republican. The portrait was reportedly commissioned to fill an empty space that had briefly been filled with an image of Vladimir Putin by a prankster.",
      "Following the backlash, a committee of leaders from both parties ordered the painting removed on Monday afternoon, according to a spokesman for Colorado's House Democrats. It will be kept in a secure location \"until further notice\".",
      "The BBC has contacted Ms Boardman for comment. Discussing her work with the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019, she acknowledged that there would \"always be anger at a president from one side or the other. It is human nature.\"",
      "Another portrait artist told the BBC he \"would have painted things slightly differently\", but that presidential portraits were nuanced, and he had sympathy for the artist.",
      "Robert Anderson, who created the official portrait of President George W Bush which hangs in the US National Portrait Gallery, said viewers tended to bring \"baggage\" depending on their feelings about the painting's subject.",
      "For that reason, the reaction to an artwork often had \"very little to do with the quality of art\", he said.",
      "Of Trump, Mr Anderson said: \"I think it would be very difficult to paint him because he has a particular impression of himself which might be very different to that of many others \u2013 probably at least half of the country.\"",
      "A spokesman for Polis told 9News said the governor was \"surprised to learn the president of the United States is an aficionado of our Colorado State Capitol and its artwork\".",
      "The statement continued: \"We appreciate the president and everyone's interest in our capitol building and are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience.\""

      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - this is called a collapse sinkhole.",

    "story": [
      "This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, \"Trumpism will outlast his presidency\". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?",
      "At 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.",
      "Exhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.",
      "The United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.",
      "Almost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.",
      "\"It must be a policy of the United States,\" President Harry Truman announced, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.\"",
      "It was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.",
      "There followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.",
      "It is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had.",
      "The United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image.",
      "The baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.",
      "Yet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.",
      "Donald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.",
      "The question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?",
      "A challenge to the Truman legacy",
      "President Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.",
      "\"For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,\" he wrote in 1987. \"Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?",
      "\"The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.\"",
      "It's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration.",
      "And the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.",
      "In the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: \"I just hate bailing Europe out again.\"",
      "Another account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"",
      "Trump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia.",
      "Many saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.",
      "On the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share.",
      "To some, Putin is an ally in a \"war on woke\".",
      "The United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for.",
      "Some think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end.",
      "\"The US is becoming divorced from European values,\" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. \"",
      "\"I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.\"",
      "Nato Article 5 'is on life support'",
      "The Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.",
      "\"If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.",
      "For almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all.",
      "In Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.",
      "Others are less sure.",
      "Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life support.",
      "\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.",
      "\"Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack\u2026 I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"",
      "According to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.",
      "\"The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,\" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.",
      "\"The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least\".",
      "And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.\"",
      "Has a 'fragmentation of the West' begun?",
      "All of this is great news for Putin. \"The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,\" he said last year. \"Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.\"",
      "In early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared \"the fragmentation of the West has begun\".",
      "\"Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,\" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. \"Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.",
      "\"And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?\"",
      "'We forgot the lessons of our history'",
      "One of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed.",
      "Britain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)",
      "\"We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,\" says Wallace. \"Now, you could argue that that was warranted.",
      "\"The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.\"",
      "The prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?",
      "\"It is enough just to stand still,\" argues Wallace. \"It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.\"",
      "Then there is the wider question of military recruitment. \"The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,\" argues Wallace.",
      "\"At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.\"",
      "But Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And \"Europeanising\" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.",
      "Others share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.",
      "\"Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,\" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. \"The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.\"",
      "Mr Arnold agrees: \"The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.\"",
      "Piecing together a new world order",
      "There is a short list of \"very important things\" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash.",
      "\"These are the so-called strategic enablers,\" he says. \"The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.",
      "\"And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.\"",
      "The question is how to achieve this.",
      "Ms van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.",
      "\"What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.\"",
      "The European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. \"It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.\"",
      "In the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.",
      "What he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the \"spheres of interest\" system that prevailed for forty years after the Second World War.",
      "We don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the \"sphere of influence\" of any of the big powers.",

      "It said the Black Sea ceasefire would come into force only when sanctions were lifted on Russian banks, insurers, companies, ports and ships that would allow it to export more agriculture and fertiliser goods.",
      "In other words, they saw this deal not just as a revival of the old Black Sea Grain Initiative they pulled out of in 2023, but also an opportunity to roll back a significant number of economic sanctions.",
      "However, doing this may take some time and thus delay any maritime ceasefire.",
      "It also may not entirely be in the gift of the US to make all the changes Russia requested.",
      "For example, any return to the SWIFT financial messaging system would require EU approval.",
      "The Kremlin also said the 30-day pause on energy strikes would be back-dated to start on 18 March and could be suspended if one side violated the deal.",
      "In other words, what has been agreed is a fragile step towards some diminution of the fighting in Ukraine but with no guarantee of success amid an atmosphere of mutual distrust.",
      "Even if today's agreement were to survive, it is still a long way from the comprehensive countrywide ceasefire the US originally wanted.",
      "It is often said that ceasefires are processes, not events. And that is as true as ever for this agreement.",
      "What matters is not the announcement of any ceasefire, but if and how it is implemented. In other words, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.",
      "Will both sides make this deal work and then live up to it? Because in the answer to those questions we will learn much about what both sides really want.",
      "Do they want a ceasefire to turn into a longer-term peace? Or do they just want to trade while pressing home their advantage on the battlefield?",

      "The vice-president said targeting Houthi forces that are attacking vessels in the Suez Canal serves European interests more than the US, because Europe has more trade running through the canal.",
      "Vance added that his boss was perhaps unaware of how US action could help Europe.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance said. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"",

      "Blame for 'free-loading' Europe",
      "Arguments over why the US could - and should - carry out the military strike against the Houthis did not sway Vance.",

      "\"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles voiced messages of support, he said.",
      "\"I will say a prayer for victory,\" Vance said as updates on the strikes were given.",

      "Controlling the message: Blame Biden",
      "To Vance's concerns that the action may be seen as going against Trump's message on Europe, the US defence secretary wrote:",
      "\"VP: I understand your concerns \u2013 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS [Trump]. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc).",
      "\"I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2013 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2013 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",

      "Waltz in the spotlight",
      "Goldberg said he got an unsolicited invitation on the Signal messaging platform on 11 March by an account named Michael Waltz, and was then added to the group chat about Yemen two days later.",
      "The president was not part of this group, but Trump's closest collaborators were.",
      "Goldberg initially thought this was a hoax, but soon realised it was real.",
      "The whole issue is adding pressure on the national security adviser, with Democrats in the House and Senate calling for an urgent inquiry.",
      "When asked on Monday about the whole incident, Trump said he didn't know anything, but he has stood by Waltz.",
      "The defence secretary has also said no secrets were revealed.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans,\" he told journalists."

The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.",

    "summary": "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era, writes Orla Guerin.",
    "story": [
      "Beneath the acrid smell of tear gas on the night air in Istanbul, there is a hint of something else - a whiff of panic on the part of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "One of his rivals has been put behind bars - so far, so familiar.",
      "But the jailing of Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, suggests President Erdogan is rattled \u2013 and he may have gone too far. The mayor's opposition Republican People's party (CHP), which is summoning vast crowds onto the streets, is certainly hoping so.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - always smartly turned out, even as he prepared to be detained - is the main rival to Turkey's increasingly authoritarian leader. He could well replace him in presidential elections due to be held by 2028 - assuming he is free to contest them.",
      "But this is far more than a row about the fate of Istanbul's mayor - charismatic though he may be.",
      "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era. Many see this as a chance to call halt and stop the descent into all-out autocracy - if it's not already too late.",
      "And they are coming out each night braving the riot police and their tear gas and rubber bullets, the ban on demonstrations, the road and bridge closures, and the risk of detention.",
      "Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu?",
      "Why are thousands of people protesting in Turkey?",
      "More than 1,000 people have been detained so far - in just 5 days - and counting. That's an indication of how easy it is to be arrested here.",
      "Turkey claims to be a functioning democracy - and at face value, it is. There are elections. Voter turnout is usually high - Turks cherish their right to go to the polls and cast their ballots. Voting is largely fair, on the day itself.",
      "The problem is what happens away from the polling stations.",
      "Opposition politicians can be jailed. Critics intimidated. Protesters arrested. The media is largely government controlled. A tweet ridiculing the president could land you in a cell. By the time polling day comes around there's a tsunami of pro-government coverage and the opposition struggles to get a look in.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu is the type of politician who can cut through all this and reach the voters. He's media savvy and has been elected mayor of Istanbul three times. Now he's accused of embezzlement, taking bribes and running a criminal organisation.",
      "If convicted he could be barred from standing in the presidential race. He's already appealing a previous conviction and sentence of two years in prison, for insulting election officials.",
      "Turkey insists that its courts are independent and simply follow the law. Human rights activists here, and independent analysts, scoff at that idea.",
      "The campaign group, Human Rights Watch, said the detention of the mayor, along with about 100 other municipal officials and politicians, is a \"politically motivated move to stifle lawful political activities\". In the past it has criticised \"politicised decisions by courts\" in Turkey.",
      "In a post on X, where he has 9.6m followers, Imamoglu said the case against him was \"a black stain on our democracy\", adding: \"I stand tall. I will never bow.\"",
      "That's what Erdogan, 71, may be afraid of - an opponent who is younger, at 53, also appeals to conservative Turkish voters, and is ready for a long fight.",
      "So, what happens now?",
      "The protests could gain momentum and keep spreading. That will present a serious challenge to Erdogan. How long before his heavily armed security forces crack down even harder? How long before someone loses their life at a protest? There is a breaking point for every strongman regime, and it can come with a single bullet.",
      "The opposition intends to keep up the pressure, and the demonstrations.",
      "But after his two decades at the top, Erdogan still has plenty of loyal supporters. He controls virtually all the levers of power and seems determined to hang on. He will be banking on the demonstrations petering out, over time.",
      "The president and his ruling AK party will be hoping the protesters will grow weary and go back to worrying about crushing inflation (39% in February), and the dwindling value of the Turkish lira, rather than free speech, and democracy.",

    "summary": "Alice Guo's star was on the rise in the Philippines - until alleged links to a scam operation led to her downfall.",
    "story": [
      "In early 2022, residents of the rural Philippine town of Bamban, north of Manila, gathered for the mayoral campaign rally of a plucky young woman named Alice Leal Guo.",
      "Supporters dressed in pink \u2013 their candidate's favourite colour \u2013 chattered in anticipation of her arrival.",
      "Then came the low thudding of a helicopter rotor, prompting cheers from the crowd. Sitting in the cockpit, Guo \u2013 in a pink shirt and a pilot's headset \u2013 flashed a smile, waving down at her supporters.",
      "As the helicopter touched down, the crowd broke into a chant: \"A-lice Guo! A-lice Guo!\"",
      "At 31, Guo's star was rising: with promises of generous subsidies and economic development, all delivered in her signature brassy, upbeat tone, she had galvanised a following in the town which would see her become its first female mayor.",
      "But few of those cheering could have predicted that less than three years later, Guo would be behind bars, facing charges of human trafficking and allegations that she was a Chinese spy.",
      "Her downfall began with a police raid that uncovered a compound where a giant scam operation was being run from just behind her office. But as the authorities delved deeper, and Guo struggled to answer basic queries about her past, a perplexing question emerged: who really is Alice Guo?",
      "The mayor everyone seemed to love",
      "Guo says she came to local politics from the pig-farming business, having managed her family's commercial piggery for several years.",
      "The career change would have required deep pockets \u2013 and when quizzed about her campaign finances much later, Guo said it was friends and acquaintances in the pig-farming business who had supported her mayoral bid.",
      "But Guo also had connections to a number of wealthy Chinese businesspeople. Little is known about them, but some have subsequently been convicted of money-laundering, and now also face charges of human trafficking alongside Guo.",
      "Her campaign focused on her sunny persona. On stage at one event, Guo told her audience: \"For our team, rule number one is: Do no harm! No harm is allowed, we should just spread love, love, love!\"",
      "Such cheerful platitudes would carry a taint of irony, in retrospect, when authorities exposed the harm and suffering they alleged had been inflicted under Guo's watch.",
      "But upon taking office in June 2022, she brought the youthful, bright-eyed energy of her campaign into Bamban Municipal Hall, painting it pink and decorating the outside of the building with flowers.",
      "\"Alice was beautiful, she was kind and she was helpful to other women,\" said Priscilla May Aban, 31, who runs a vegetable stall in the town. She told the BBC that she had voted for Guo precisely because she was a woman, adding that as mayor, Guo had arranged cleaning jobs for women of the town.",
      "Guo was widely regarded as a caring and empathetic leader, judging by conversations the BBC had with several residents of Bamban. Miah Mejia, the daughter of one of Alice's political allies, claimed that she had given a free scholarship to every local household. Another interviewee told us he hadn't received a college scholarship but had been given a cash subsidy for his school fees.",
      "An emotional Francisco Flores, 75, said, \"She's helped a lot of poor people here in Bamban, giving medicines and the way she is with people, you'd never see a problem.\"",
      "He proudly mentioned the arrival of a McDonald's and a branch of the Philippine fast-food chain Jollibee during Guo's tenure.",
      "Online, pro-Guo social media accounts portrayed her as a progressive young mayor presiding over a pink-tinted wonderland of parades, buffalo races and concerts.",
      "A year-and-half into her mayoralty, however, this carefully crafted image began to crumble.",
      "Inside Bamban's underbelly",
      "In February 2024, Philippine police received a report about a Vietnamese national who had escaped from the captivity of Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated, a company operating out of a walled compound in Bamban.",
      "On the evening of 12 March, police officers and soldiers gathered nearby to plan a raid on the site, located just a minute's walk from Guo's office in the Municipal Hall.",
      "One officer who was there, Marvin de la Paz of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), told the BBC that around midnight, police informants sent word that people were leaving the compound in buses.",
      "Suspecting that their plans for a raid had been leaked, Mr de la Paz and his colleagues raced straight for the compound. On the way, they saw people fleeing in the other direction, and some officers in the convoy had to peel off and chase them down. When they arrived at the site, they found one of the largest scam hubs ever uncovered in the Philippines, containing 36 buildings and spanning almost 20 acres.",
      "\"We were amazed,\" Mr de la Paz said, \"That was our first time seeing such a grandiose entrance [to a scam compound]... Somehow you feel like you're small in this compound.\"",
      "It later emerged that the compound was built on land which Guo had previously owned \u2013 and that, as mayor, she had granted Zun Yuan a business permit. Her name also appeared on an electricity bill found at the site.",
      "Alice Guo's lawyers did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "Zun Yuan was purportedly an online gambling and entertainment company, which held a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (Pogo) licence \u2013 accreditation that previously allowed such entities to operate legally in the Philippines.",
      "A relaxation in gambling regulations under ex-President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017 led to a surge of Pogo-driven business activity. But many scam syndicates also found Pogo licences useful for masking their criminal operations \u2013 and PAOCC told the BBC they found evidence that Zun Yuan was running \"pig-butchering\" scams from its office in the compound.",
      "Pig-butchering is a con where scammers take time to build trust with victims by posing as lovers or prospective business partners, then trick them into investing their money into fraudulent schemes.",
      "When shown around the compound by PAOCC officers earlier this month, the BBC found, in a deserted employee dormitory, training scripts on how to scam targets.",
      "\"I want to create my own financial empire,\" a scripted character \u2013 a female crypto expert at an international bank - says to her target, before flattering him and encouraging him to share his dreams. She is told to put her target on hold while pretending to \"cash in on a trade\" - only to declare, moments later, that she had made a killing. She then asks whether he himself knows how to trade, setting him up for the transfer of money that would soon follow.",
      "This is just one of the many ways in which these compounds swindle billions  of dollars around the world. Typically run by Chinese organised crime groups across South East Asia, they are staffed by a mixture of willing employees and trafficked victims who are forced to scam.",
      "According to de la Paz, he and his colleagues found more than 300 foreign nationals in the Bamban compound, many of them working there against their will.",
      "Punishments for disobedient or underperforming workers ranged from beatings to the banal: the BBC was shown a notebook from the compound, in which a worker had copied out  the phrase, \"I will meet my targets tomorrow\", hundreds of times in Chinese.",
      "Enclosed by walls topped with barbed wire, the workers' area of the compound was its own self-contained world, featuring a basketball court, supermarket and restaurants. Employees lived in rooms of six, each with a balcony equipped with a toilet and shower.",
      "Their bosses meanwhile lived in a separate gated enclave, says de la Paz, who showed the BBC one of the villas there.",
      "A marble-clad living room featured a high-end entertainment system, security monitor and ornate hardwood furniture. Behind the house was a swimming pool, beside which was a staircase that led down into what were supposedly escape tunnels, now flooded with water.",
      "By the time security forces stormed the Bamban compound on the evening of 12 March 2024, some of these scam bosses had already eluded capture.",
      "But the raid signalled a shift in the political climate.",
      "In June 2022, just as Guo was being sworn in as mayor, Rodrigo Duterte's presidential term had ended.",
      "His successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, soon began facing calls for a ban on Pogo businesses. Many across Philippine society sounded the alarm about the criminality that often lurked within, despite the millions they brought in as revenue. Their biggest customers were rich Chinese, which led to concerns about foreign influence as Marcos, unlike his predecessor, courted Washington over Beijing.",
      "When the raid in Bamban happened, it exposed a dark underbelly of the Philippines \u2013 and the two worlds of Alice Guo   \u2013 the pink office from where she had sought a political career and the scam compound, which suggested far murkier ambitions      \u2013 collapsed in on one another.",
      "'Amnesia girl'",
      "Guo had been a relatively unknown name in the Philippines until last May when she was called to appear before the Senate to explain her links to the scam compound.",
      "Almost overnight, she became a meme. When she told senators she had grown up on a family farm, it brought swift ridicule from Filipinos who said she was too glamorous for the countryside. She became notorious for her inconsistent, vague comments, as well as her claims to have forgotten basic details of her early life, leading social media to nickname her \"my amnesia girl\".",
      "Guo said she'd had a secluded childhood as the child of a Chinese father and Filipino mother \u2013 but could not remember where in the Philippines her family home had been.",
      "At one point, a senator said to her: \"Please mayor, a little more candour than you have shown so far in answering some of the important questions.\"",
      "She told sceptical senators that she had sold her stake in the land before becoming mayor, and that the issuance of a business permit to Zun Yuan had been a mere administrative measure.",
      "Suspicion mounted when, during the hearings, a court in Singapore convicted two of Guo's Chinese former business partners in the Philippines of money-laundering.",
      "Then, last July, despite the intense public interest in her case, Guo managed to slip through the travel restrictions imposed on her and escape to Indonesia. A few months later, she was re-arrested and returned to the Philippines.",
      "It was also in July that Philippine investigators made a breakthrough. Guo's fingerprints were found to match those on file for a girl from China named Guo Hua Ping, who had arrived in the Philippines alongside her mother, also Chinese, in the early 2000s.",
      "This revelation sparked another line of inquiry in the Senate: the idea that Guo might be a spy, exercising influence or gathering intelligence for the Chinese state. The idea spread quickly among the watching public, dominating public discussion of the case.",
      "Jaye Bekema - a senior officer on the staff of Risa Hontiveros, one of the senators who probed potential links between scam syndicates and Chinese intelligence - says the possibility that Guo was a spy warranted an investigation.",
      "\"I think there should be some clarity as to what a spy means,\" Ms Bekema said, while stressing that there is no conclusive proof of Guo being a spy.",
      "\"I am more likely to believe that she didn't plan to be a spy, but that she was tapped to be one [by the Chinese government] because of her criminal connections and her influence on local politics and the local government.\"",
      "In many ways, Guo had become a victim of her own success. The career she chose and the limelight she worked hard to attract meant that she was fully exposed to public scrutiny when China-Philippines relations soured under Marcos.",
      "As political rhetoric escalated and tensions between the two countries spiralled, not least of all in the South China Sea, the young mayor found herself in the crosshairs of espionage accusations.",
      "Others, however, are more sceptical of the allegation. The Chinese state and Guo would have made strange bedfellows, according to Teresita Ang See, a civic leader in the Chinese-Filipino community.",
      "\"What can she spy on in a place like [Bamban]? It's in central Luzon, it's not near any of the sensitive establishments. Why use her? She's very visible, she flaunts her lifestyle. The last person you would use as a spy would be a person like Alice Guo,\" says Ang See.",
      "The Pogo problem",
      "But those who led the questioning against Guo, such as Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, say that it's more complicated than that.",
      "\"Transnational criminals working around the region know how to tap into... I'll call it local talent to penetrate our society, whether through politics or business,\" he explains.",
      "Either way, Guo's case shed light on the Philippine state's vulnerability to being corrupted and co-opted by criminal groups abusing Pogo licences.",
      "In mid-2024, President Marcos declared a blanket ban on all Pogos, citing their widespread abuse by organised crime.",
      "Gatchalian says that the investigation into Alice Guo helped drive this change.",
      "\"Because of it, there was a groundswell of people really clamouring for a ban,\" he tells the BBC. \"And that's when the president officially banned Pogos.\"",
      "Since then, Philippine police have raided scores of scam hubs across the country. But given how influential the syndicates have become, there are concerns that leaks within the security forces and government institutions are allowing criminals to evade capture, according to Mr de la Paz.",
      "Ms Bekema says she feels certain that some candidates in the upcoming national elections are still being financed with Pogo money, while Ang See says that serving police officers have been found working for the criminal syndicates.",
      "In Bamban, concerns about state infiltration seem far from people's minds.",
      "The streets are decked with brightly-coloured campaign posters for the upcoming municipal elections. The Municipal Hall has been whitewashed, and the flowers have been removed.",
      "Guo is currently on trial in six separate cases, potentially facing decades in prison, and has been barred from running for public office again. She has pleaded not guilty to human trafficking charges.",
      "Yet many still treasure the memory of their embattled ex-mayor.",
      "One of those currently standing for Bamban councillor is Miah Mejia's father, Fortunato, a garrulous 69-year-old, who also ran in 2022 as a member of Alice's party, although he lost. He even featured in one of her publicity videos at the time.",
      "He says that the people of Bamban had taken a chance by electing Guo, but that she had good connections to Chinese investors and had delivered on all her promises to the townspeople.",
      "He is also indifferent to the Senate's evidence that Guo was not a Filipino.",
      "\"That's what they've been showing, but we still don't believe it because we don't care whether she's Filipino or not,\" he says. \"What's important is whether or not she helps us.\"",
      "Mr Mejia is adamant that the Alice Guo he knew would not have been involved in human trafficking.",
      "\"Never, ever would she do something like that,\" he says, flatly. \"I know she has a heart. She fears the Lord.\"",

      "Amina will never forget the moment her childhood changed. She was just 12 years old when she was told she could no longer go to school like boys.",
      "The new school year began on Saturday in Afghanistan but for the fourth consecutive year, girls over 12 were barred from attending classes.",
      "\"All my dreams were shattered,\" she says, her voice fragile and filled with emotion.",
      "Amina, now 15, has always wanted to become a doctor. As a little girl, she suffered from a heart defect and underwent surgery. The surgeon who saved her life was a woman \u2013 an image that stayed with her and inspired her to take her studies seriously.",
      "But in 2021, when the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan, Amina's dream was abruptly put on hold.",
      "\"When my dad told me the schools were closed, I was really sad. It was a very bad feeling,\" she says quietly. \"I wanted to get an education so that I could become a doctor.\"",
      "The restrictions on education for teenage girls, imposed by the Taliban, has affected more than one million girls, according to Unicef, the UN's children's agency.",
      "Now, madrassas \u2013 religious centres focused on Islamic teachings \u2013 have become the only way for many women and teenage girls to access education. However, those whose families can afford private tuition may still have access to subjects including maths, science and languages.",
      "While the madrassas are seen by some as a way to offer young women access to some of the education they would have had in mainstream schools, others say they are no substitute and there are concerns of brainwashing.",
      "I meet Amina in the dimly-lit basement of Al-Hadith madrassa in Kabul, a newly established private religious educational centre for around 280 female students of various ages.",
      "The basement is cold, with cardboard walls and a sharp chill in the air. After chatting for about 10 minutes, our toes are already going numb.",
      "Al-Hadith madrassa was founded a year ago by Amina's brother, Hamid, who felt compelled to act after seeing the toll that the education ban had taken on her.",
      "\"When girls were denied education, my sister's dream of becoming a heart surgeon was crushed, significantly affecting her wellbeing\", says Hamid, who is in his early thirties.",
      "\"Having the chance to go back to school, as well as learning midwifery and first aid, made her feel much better about her future,\" he adds.",
      "Afghanistan remains the only country where women and girls are banned from secondary and higher education.",
      "The Taliban government originally suggested the prohibition would be temporary, pending the fulfilment of certain conditions, such as an \"Islamic\" curriculum. However, there has been no progress towards reopening schools for older girls in the years since.",
      "In January 2025, a report by the Afghanistan Centre for Human Rights suggested that madrassas are being used to further the Taliban's ideological goals.",
      "The report alleges that \"extremist content\" has been integrated into their curriculum.",
      "It says that textbooks advocated by the Taliban promote its political and military activities, and prohibited the mixing of men and women, as well as endorsing the enforced wearing of the hijab.",
      "The Afghan Centre for Human Rights calls the ban on older girls attending school a \"systematic and targeted violation\" of their right to quality education.",
      "Before the Taliban return, the number of registered madrassas is believed to have been around 5,000. They focus on religious education, which includes Quranic, Hadith, Sharia law, and Arabic language studies.",
      "But since the restrictions on girls' education were introduced some have expanded the teaching of subjects including chemistry, physics, mathematics, and geography, and languages like Dari, Pashto, and English.",
      "Though a few madrassas tried to introduce midwifery and first aid training, the Taliban banned medical training for women in December last year.",
      "Hamid said he was dedicated to providing an education which blends both religious and other academic subjects for secondary school-age girls.",
      "\"Socialising with others girls again made my sister much happier,\" he told me with a smile, clearly proud of his sister's resilience.",
      "We visit another independently-run madrassa in Kabul.",
      "The Shaikh Abdul Qadr Jilani madrassa educates more than 1,800 girls and women from the ages of five to 45. Classes are organised by student ability rather than age. We were able to visit under strict supervision.",
      "Like Al-Hadath madrassa, it is freezing cold. The three-storey building has no heating, and some classrooms were missing doors and windows.",
      "In one large room, two Quran classes and a sewing class are taking place simultaneously, as a group of girls wearing hijabs and black face masks sit cross-legged on the carpet.",
      "The only heat source in the school is a small electric radiator in the second-floor office of the director, Mohammad Ibrahim Barakzai.",
      "Mr Barakzai tells me that academic subjects are taught alongside religious ones.",
      "But when I ask for evidence of that, staff search for a while before bringing out a few tattered maths and science textbooks.",
      "Meanwhile, the classrooms are well stocked with religious texts.",
      "This madrassa is divided into two sections: formal and informal.",
      "The formal section covers subjects like languages, history, science, and Islamic studies. The informal section covers Quranic studies, Hadith, Islamic law, and practical skills like tailoring.",
      "Notably, graduates from the informal section outnumber those from the formal section by 10 to one.",
      "Hadiya, who is 20 years old, recently graduated from the madrassa after studying a broad range of subjects including maths, physics, chemistry, and geography.",
      "She speaks passionately about chemistry and physics. \"I love science. It's all about matter and how these concepts relate to the world around me,\" she says.",
      "Hadiya now teaches the Quran at the madrassa, as she tells me there was not enough demand for her favourite subjects.",
      "Safia, also 20, teaches the Pashto language at Al-Hadith madrassa. She passionately believes that girls in religious centres should enhance what she described as their personal development.",
      "She focuses on Fiqh, the Islamic legal framework essential for daily Muslim practices.",
      "\"Fiqh is not included in mainstream schools or universities. As a Muslim woman, studying Fiqh is vital for women's betterment,\" she says.",
      "\"Understanding concepts such as ghusl \u2013 ablution \u2013 the distinctions in prostration between genders, and the prerequisites for prayer are crucial.\"",
      "However, she adds that madrassas \"cannot serve as a substitute for mainstream schools and universities\".",
      "\"Educational institutions, including mainstream schools and universities, are absolutely essential for our society. The closure of these establishments would lead to a gradual decline in knowledge within Afghanistan,\" she warns.",
      "Tawqa, 13, is a quiet, reserved student who also studies at the Shaikh Abdul Qadr Jilani madrassa. From a devout family, she attends classes with her older sister.",
      "\"Religious subjects are my favourite,\" she says. \"I like learning about what kind of hijab a woman should wear, how she should treat her family, how to treat her brother and husband well and never be rude to them.\"",
      "\"I want to become a religious missionary and share my faith with people around the world.\"",
      "The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, has raised serious concerns about the Taliban's restrictive \"madrassa-style\" education system.",
      "He has emphasised the need to restore educational opportunities for girls beyond sixth grade and for women in higher education.",
      "Mr Bennett warned that this limited education, combined with high unemployment and poverty, \"could foster radical ideologies and increase the risk of homegrown terrorism, threatening regional and global stability\".",
      "The Taliban Ministry of Education claims that around three million students in Afghanistan are enrolled in these religious educational centres.",
      "It has promised to reopen girls' schools under certain conditions, but this has yet to materialise.",

      "India's already fragile healthcare system collapsed under the pandemic's weight.",
      "The WHO estimated over 4.7 million Covid deaths in India -  nearly 10 times the official count - but the government rejected the figure, citing flaws in the methodology.",
      "Five years later, BBC India journalists reflect on their experiences recounting how, at times, they became part of the story they were covering.",
      "'Oxygen, oxygen, can you get me oxygen?'",
      "Soutik Biswas, BBC News",
      "It was the summer of 2021.",
      "I woke up to the frantic voice of a school teacher. Her 46-year-old husband had been battling Covid in a Delhi hospital, where oxygen was as scarce as hope.",
      "Here we go again, I thought, dread creeping in. India was trapped in the deadly grip of a lethal second wave of infections, with Delhi at its heart. And it was just another day in a city where breathing itself had become a privilege.",
      "We scrambled for help, making calls, sending SOS messages, hoping someone might have a lead.",
      "Her voice shook as she told us her husband's oxygen levels had dipped to 58. It should have been 92 or higher. He was slipping, but she clung to the small comfort that it had climbed to 62. He was still conscious, still speaking. For now.",
      "But how long could this last? I wondered. How many more lives would be lost because the basics - oxygen, beds, medicine - were beyond reach? This wasn't supposed to happen in 2021. Not here.",
      "The woman called back. The hospital didn't even have an oxygen flow meter, she said. She had to find one herself.",
      "We reached out again. Phones buzzed, tweets flew into the void, hoping someone would see us. Finally, a device was located - a small victory in a sea of despair. The oxygen would flow. For now.",
      "The numbers didn't lie, though.",
      "A report from the same hospital told of a 40-year-old man who died waiting for a bed. He found a stretcher, at least, the report helpfully added. That was where we were now: grateful for a place to lay the dead.",
      "In the face of this, oxygen was a commodity. So were medicines, in short supply and hoarded by those who could pay. People were dying because they couldn't breathe, and the city choked on its own apathy.",
      "This was a war. It felt like a war. And we were losing it.",
      "'Most difficult story I have ever covered'",
      "Yogita Limaye, BBC News",
      "\"Balaji, why are you lying like this,\" screamed a woman outside Delhi's GTB hospital, shaking her unconscious brother who was lying on a stretcher.",
      "Minutes later, her brother, the father of two children, died, waiting outside a hospital before he was even seen by a doctor.",
      "I will never forget her cry.",
      "Around her, families pleaded at the door of the hospital to get a doctor to come and see their loved ones.",
      "They were among hundreds of pleas for help we heard over the weeks we reported on how the second wave of Covid, which began in March 2021, brought a nation to its knees.",
      "It was as though people had been left to tackle a vicious pandemic on their own \u2013  going from hospital to hospital searching for beds and oxygen.",
      "The second wave had not come without warning, but India's government, which had declared victory over the disease two months earlier, was caught unprepared by  the resurgence.",
      "In the ICU of a major hospital, I saw the head doctor pace up and down, making one phone call after another frantically searching for supplies of oxygen.",

      "In 2021, I reported Altuf Shamsi's story, which sums up the unimaginable pain millions went through.",

He knew me through a friend and called to ask if I could help him find another doctor after the hospital where his dad was admitted told him that chances of survival were zero.

      "The two other incidents came closer to home than anything else.",
      "A relative deteriorated very fast after being admitted to a hospital.",
      "He was put on a ventilator and doctors gave a bleak prognosis. One of them advised trying an experimental drug that had shown some results in the UK.",
      "I tweeted and called everybody I thought could help. It's hard to put that frustration into words - he was sinking with each passing hour but the drug that could potentially save him was nowhere to be found.",
      "A kind doctor helped us with one injection but we needed three more. Then someone read my tweet and reached out - she had procured three vials for her father but he died before he could be given the doses. I took her help and my relative survived.",
      "But a cousin did not. He was admitted to the same hospital. His oxygen levels were dipping every hour and he needed to be put on a ventilator, but the hospital didn't have any free.",
      "I made calls the whole night.",
      "The next morning, the hospital ran out of oxygen, leading to many deaths, including his. He left behind his wife and two young children. I still wonder if there was something more I could have done.",

      "The bus station was deserted. A few hundred metres away, I met men, women and children who were looking for ways to reach home, hundreds of miles away. Over the next few days, those numbers swelled into millions as people desperately tried to find a way to be with their families and loved ones.",

My mother, like millions of other people, didn't really understand what Covid was - the disease that had suddenly disrupted their lives.",
      "Every time I called, she had only one question: \"When will you visit?\" The fear that I could carry the virus to her at a time when she was most vulnerable kept me away.",
      "On 16 January 2021, I was at Max hospital in Delhi when India rolled out the world's biggest vaccination drive, promising to vaccinate all the adults in the country of 1.4 billion people. Doctors and medical staff there described it as a \"new dawn\". Some told me they would visit their families as soon as they received their second doses.",
      "I called my mother and told her that I will get my vaccine and visit her soon. But a week later, she was gone.",

      "Anagha Pathak, BBC Marathi",
      "A few days after India announced the lockdown, I was travelling to the border of Maharashtra state to document the impact of the restrictions.",
      "It was three in the morning as I drove along the eerily empty Mumbai-Agra highway. My hometown of Nashik looked unrecognisable.",
      "Instead of traffic, migrant workers filled the road, walking back home, stranded and out of work. Among them was a young couple from Uttar Pradesh. They had worked as labourers in Mumbai. The wife, still in her early 20s, was pregnant. They had hoped to catch a ride on a truck, but that didn't happen. By the time they reached Nashik, they had run out of food, water and money.",
      "I will never forget seeing the pregnant woman, her fragile body walking under the scorching sun. I had never felt more helpless. Covid protocols prevented me from offering them a ride. All I could do was give them some water and snacks, while documenting their journey.",
      "A few miles ahead, around 300 people waited for a government bus to take them to the state border. But it was nowhere in sight. After making some calls, two buses finally arrived - still not enough. But I made sure the couple got on the one heading towards Madhya Pradesh state, where they were supposed to catch another bus.",
      "I followed them in my car and waited for some time for them to catch their next bus. It never came.",
      "Eventually, I left. I had an assignment to finish.",
      "Five years have passed, and I still wonder: Did the woman make it home? Did she survive? I don't know her name, but I still remember her weary eyes and fragile body.",

    "summary": "A mother explains why she - and 77% of the country\u2019s women - have used dangerous creams.",
    "story": [
      "A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.",
      "The 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.",
      "Fatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.",
      "Another was left with darker skin than before - with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.",
      "Her toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.",
      "\"My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favours my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,\" Fatima says.",
      "She says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.",
      "At first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time.",
      "But then the burns and scars appeared.",
      "Skin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.",
      "Women in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country - 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "In Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.",
      "The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.",
      "Other ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.",
      "Dermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.",
      "The skin may become thinner, with the result that wounds take longer to heal, and are more likely to become infected, the WHO says.",
      "The situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.",
      "It is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.",
      "\"A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,\" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology clinic in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.",
      "She estimates that 80% of the women she has met have bleached their children, or plan to do so.",
      "Some were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.",
      "One of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.",
      "However, smokers and drug users also sometimes have dark patches on their hands, due to the smoke.",
      "So users of skin-lightening products are sometimes mistakenly assumed to belong to this group.",
      "Fatima says that is what happened to her daughters, aged 16 and 14.",
      "\"They faced discrimination from society - they all point fingers at them and call them drug addicts. This has affected them a lot,\" she says.",
      "They have both lost potential fianc\u00e9s because men do not want to be associated with women who might be thought to take drugs.",
      "I visited a popular market in Kano, where people who call themselves \"mixologists\" create skin-whitening creams from scratch.",
      "The market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold.",
      "Some pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.",
      "I noticed that many bleaching creams, with labels saying they were for babies, contained regulated substances.",
      "Other sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.",
      "I also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.",
      "One woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.",
      "\"Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,\" she said.",
      "One seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies \"glow\", or to look \"radiant and shiny\".",
      "Most seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.",
      "One salesman said he used \"a lot of kojic\" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.",
      "The approved dosage of kojic acid in creams in Nigeria is 1%, according to Nafdac.",
      "I even saw salesmen giving women injections.",
      "Dr Leonard Omokpariola, a director at Nafdac, says attempts are being made to educate people about the risks.",
      "He also says markets are being raided, and there are efforts to seize skin-lightening ingredients at Nigeria's borders as they are brought into the country.",
      "But he says it was sometimes hard for law-enforcement officials to identify these substances.",
      "\"Some of them are just being transported in unlabelled containers, so if you do not take them to the labs for evaluation, you can't tell what is inside.\"",
      "Fatima says her actions will haunt her forever, especially if her children's scars do not fade.",
      "\"When I confided in my mum about what I did, due to her behaviour, and when she heard the dangers of the cream and what stigma her grandchildren are facing, she was sad that they had to go through that and apologised,\" she says.",

    "title": "What makes a rum Jamaican? Question at heart of Caribbean legal dispute",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ez63ndvo",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

    "story": [
      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

    "summary": "As Conan O'Brien was honored with the Mark Twain Prize at the Kennedy Center, many comics targeted President Trump from the stage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O'Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O'Brien.",
      "\"I think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\" comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \"It's in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\"",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

    "summary": "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, and cofounder of Spy Magazine, Graydon Carter recounts a career as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture in his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, Graydon Carter is a family man, father of five grown children, better known for his signature white hair and urbane elegance, never without a handkerchief \u2013 Herm\u00e8s, he has 30 of them (\"This is my greatest luxury,\" he says) \u2013   chronicler of the privileged set of which he is a member, though not born to it.",
      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salvador-dali-museum-of-surrealist-art/",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

    "summary": "A lawyer for the two songwriters suing Mariah Carey said they will \"make a decision shortly on whether to appeal.\"",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \"disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",
      "Last month, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame announced Carey as one of its 2025 nominees.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "story": [
      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",

With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather's bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth.",
      "That's unusual, financially speaking, and it's thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets people\u00a0people with disabilities\u00a0save money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that's linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income and\u00a0Medicaid. Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month.",
      "\"With this ABLE account, we don't have to worry as much,\" said Deb Safarik, 71, Paul's mother, with whom he lives. \"It's nice that he can work and save, and not have that be held against him.\"",

      "Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",
      "Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer.",
      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",
      "Two online resources \u2014\u00a0ABLE Today\u00a0and the\u00a0ABLE National Resource Center\u00a0\u2014 can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies.",

      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",

      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen.

      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA.

The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",

      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:34:50 -0400",
    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

      "\"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities,\" 23andMe Chair Mark Jensen said in a statement. \"We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients.\"",

      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",
      "23andMe also allows customers to delete their accounts. To do that, users must log in to their account and submit a request. The company will send an email confirming the request to delete the data, which the user must then verify.",
      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",
      "\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

      "Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issued a one-month reprieve to U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he also issued a pause until Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",

      "\"Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,\" Caldwell added.",
      "She notes that while automakers \"can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time.\"",
      "In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.  \u00a0 \"It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,\" Caldwell said.",
      "When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear. \u00a0 \"So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,\" Caldwell said. \"We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\"",

Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",

You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",
      "Two online resources \u2014\u00a0ABLE Today\u00a0and the\u00a0ABLE National Resource Center\u00a0\u2014 can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies.",

      "President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force's future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.",
      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",
      "A fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.",

The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",
      "Few details of what the new NGAD fighter would look like have been public, although Trump said early versions have been conducting test flights for the last five years. Renderings by both Lockheed Martin and Boeing have highlighted a flat, tail-less aircraft with a sharp nose.",
      "A separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration's Air Force secretary, Frank Kendall, ordered a pause on the NGAD program to review if the aircraft was still needed or if the program, which was first designed in 2018, needed to be modified to reflect the past few years of warfighting advances.",
      "That review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.",
      "NGAD will bring \"an entirely different level of low observability,\" the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling. A future unmanned version of NGAD also is planned as the Pentagon improves the AI for the aircraft, the official said.",

      "For President Trump, the barrage of tariffs the U.S. is set\u00a0to unleash on the country's largest trading partners on April 2 amounts to \"Liberation Day,\" as he described the trade measures Thursday on social media. To the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell relayed on Wednesday, tariffs are a broadside on economic growth.",
      "Where does that leave investors? Scratching their heads, judging by today's trading. Stocks wobbled early, rebounded and then lost momentum in the afternoon. The S&P 500 fell 12 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,663, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended largely flat and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%.",
      "The dip followed the stock market's modest bounce yesterday after the Fed announced it was standing pat on interest rates, as Wall Street had expected. Indeed, investors may not have learned much from the central bank and Powell's remarks given that economists have already begun forecasting weaker growth and higher inflation as the U.S. moves to deploy tariffs against Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and other countries.",
      "Powell's uncertainty principle",
      "Another thing investors didn't learn from the Fed: The world is a much more uncertain place today than it was before Mr. Trump was re-elected in November. Financial markets have slumped this year as the White House laid out its plans for tariffs, with the S&P 500 falling briefly into correction territory, or 10% below its previous peak. The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",
      "That uncertainty refers to the questions regarding how the Trump administration's economic agenda on trade, immigration, fiscal policy and government regulation could affect the economy.",
      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year. Over the longer term, the question hovering over markets will be how the economy responds to the shock therapy administered by Mr. Trump, and whether the Fed has the medicine to address it.",

    "story": [
      "Segway is recalling about 220,000 Segway scooters sold nationwide because the product's folding mechanism can fail while in use, posing a fall hazard that has left 20 people with injuries including broken bones, bruises and lacerations, the company said Thursday.",
      "The recall involves all Segway Ninebot Max G3OP and Max G30LP KickScooters, according to a\u00a0notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Los Angeles-based Segway said it has received 68 reports of folding mechanism failures, including the 20 injuries.",
      "Manufactured in China and Malaysia, the scooters sold online at Amazon.com and Segway.com and at Best Buy, Costco, Sam's Club, Target and Walmart for between $600 and $1,000 from January 2020 through February 2025.",
      "The Max G30LP KickScooter is gray with yellow accents and the Max G30P is black with yellow accents. The brand name \"ninebot\" appears on the foot platform and the top of the handlebars.",
      "Consumers should stop using the recalled scooters and contact Segway to determine whether the folding mechanism needs adjustment and to get a free maintenance kit that includes tools and instructions on checking and tightening the mechanism.",
      "Segway can be reached at 800-914-6110 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, by email at\u00a0recall@segway.com, or online at\u00a0https://service.segway.com/recall\u00a0or\u00a0www.segway.com\u00a0\u2014 click on \"Recall Center\" at the bottom of the page for more information.",
      "The recall is not the first by Segway. The company in November recalled about 1,400 Segway Ninebot P100 KickScooters after getting 31 reports of broken front forks on the scooters and six injuries. It also recalled Ninebot Kids bike helmets that did not comply with federal safety standards in March of 2022.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order in the challenge brought by unions who argued DOGE's access was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "summary": "President Trump told reporters he does not believe national security adviser Mike Waltz should apologize for inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal group chat.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday defended national security adviser Mike Waltz as his administration faces questions about its use of the encrypted messaging app Signal after a reporter was mistakenly added to a group chat detailing highly sensitive plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that the information that was discussed on the 18-member group chat, which included high-ranking officials like Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was not classified and said Waltz is a \"very good man\" who will \"continue to do a good job.\"",
      "\"I don't think he should apologize. I think he's doing his best,\" the president said of Waltz. \"It's equipment and technology that's not perfect and probably he won't be using it again, at least not in the very near future.\"",
      "Speaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night, Waltz called the situation \"embarrassing\" and said he takes \"full responsibility,\" adding that he \"built\" the Signal chat group.",
      "However, he claimed that he did not have Goldberg's contact information on his phone and is unsure how Goldberg's number got there, or how Goldberg got into the chat.",
      "\"I don't text him, he wasn't on my phone,\" Waltz said. \"And we're going to figure out how this happened.\"",
      "Waltz also said that a staffer did not put Goldberg's contact information into the phone.",
      "The Trump administration's use of the app to detail the plans to bomb Houthi targets on March 15 was revealed Monday by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, who wrote in a piece that he was added to a chat on Signal by an account that shared Waltz's name earlier this month.",
      "Several days later, an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out plans for strikes in Yemen, which included information about \"weapons packages, targets and timing\" shortly before the attack took place, Goldberg wrote.",
      "Among those included in the chat were accounts that appeared to belong to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg's account. Witkoff was in Moscow when he was added to the group chat, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting found.",
      "Hegseth denied any war plans were discussed, but the National Security Council said in a statement to CBS News on Monday that the message thread detailed by Goldberg \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "The breach sparked immediate condemnation of the Trump administration from congressional Democrats and raised questions about the use of Signal on government or personal devices, as well as whether top U.S. officials were sharing classified information.",
      "In a letter sent to Mr. Trump Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \"Hegseth should be fired immediately.\"",
      "\"The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans\u2014including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used\u2014during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,\" Jeffries wrote. \"His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters that he believes his administration will limit its use of Signal in the future, though he acknowledged that \"a lot of people\" across the federal government rely on the app.",
      "\"I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again,\" he said. \"We may be forced to use it. We may be in a situation where you need speed as opposed to gross safety and may be forced to use it. Generally speaking, I think we won't be using it very much.\"",
      "The president questioned whether the app has vulnerabilities that allow other users to hack into conversations.",
      "\"I think Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Waltz said technical experts and legal teams will look into the issue.",
      "\"Of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible,\" he said. \"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger.\"",
      "Waltz later attacked Goldberg and claimed he and other reporters in Washington, D.C., have \"made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.\"",
      "\"This one in particular I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we're looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room,\" he said.",
      "Waltz told the president that Goldberg is attempting to deflect attention away from the \"freedom that you're enabling,\" and said \"the world owes President Trump a favor.\"",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard both appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier Tuesday and faced questions from senators about the controversy. The two denied classified information was exchanged in the group chat, but Ratcliffe confirmed he was a participant in the thread.",
      "Ratcliffe added that Signal was on his agency computer when he took the helm of the CIA earlier this year and said it's \"permissible\" to use it to communicate and coordinate \"for work purposes.\"",

      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",

      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",

      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",

      "President Donald Trump issued an executive order Tuesday targeting Chicago law firm Jenner & Block. The firm also has an office in Washington, D.C.",
      "Jenner and Block has been an active part of the legal challenges against Mr. Trump's executive orders, including successfully securing a preliminary injunction against an order from the administration that reduced health care access for transgender youth.",
      "That case is still pending in a Maryland-based federal court.",
      "This executive order instructs officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearance, identify any good, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal government jobs.",
      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",
      "The executive order specifies that Weissman is prohibited from being hired by or working for the federal government unless a waiver is issued.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted a number of law firms that have been active in challenging or pausing executive orders and policies in the courts.",
      "Previously, the president issued and then rescinded an executive order targeting international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton after it pledged to review its hiring practices and provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.",
      "A spokesperson for Jenner & Block responded to the order in a statement, writing in part, \"Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.\"",

    "summary": "Consumer confidence continues to wane as Americans worry about the economy, jobs and their income.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly anxious about their financial prospects, with a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low amid growing concerns about tariffs and inflation.",
      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",
      "Adams predicts a weakening in discretionary consumer spending in the near-term, but sees a potential break in the clouds further ahead if, perhaps in 2026, tariff talk is replaced by tax cuts.",
      "\"If the public conversation turns from spending cuts to tax cut happy talk, consumer sentiment could rebound. But in the meantime, the economy is likely to slow and underperform its growth in 2023 and 2024,\" he said.",

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify about global threats facing the U.S. However the annual hearing, which typically focuses on threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, largely concentrated on the lapse.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",
      "Group chat controversy",
      "On Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans, although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later denied any war plans were discussed. Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The National Security Council said Monday in a statement to CBS News that the message thread \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now\": Democrats grill on group chat",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe both denied that classified information was shared in the group chat in a feisty exchange with Warner. Confronted by Warner, Gabbard initially declined to say whether she was part of the chat.",
      "\"Because it's all classified?\" Warner said.",
      "\"Because this is currently under review,\" Gabbard responded.",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now,\" Warner said.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year.",
      "\"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year. \"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "\"It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels,\" Ratcliffe said. \"My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "Ratcliffe later told Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommended that \"high-level officials who would be targeted by foreign adversaries\" use \"end-to-end encrypted apps whenever possible.\"",
      "The spy chiefs also denied that the conversation included information on weapons packages, targets or timing of the strikes, as Goldberg reported.",
      "\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Ratcliffe said, with Gabbard adding \"same answer.\"",
      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia noted that, according to the messages shared by Goldberg, the timing of the strikes were debated by Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth.",
      "\"They were discussing the timing of sending U.S. air crews into enemy airspace, where they faced an air defense threat, correct?\" Ossoff asked, repeating the question when Ratcliffe didn't directly answer. \"They're talking about the timing of U.S. airstrikes, correct?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "During questioning from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard also denied participating in any Signal group chats in which classified information was shared.",
      "Gabbard told Wyden she had \"no objection\" to cooperating with an audit to confirm such, while Ratcliffe said he would comply with any follow up that the National Security Council deemed appropriate.",
      "Another heated moment came during the back and forth between Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, and Ratcliffe. Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "\"It's an embarrassment,\" Bennet said. \"You need to do better.\"",

      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members.

    "story": [
      "The National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees in February 2025 warning them of vulnerabilities in using the encrypted messaging application Signal, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "News of the NSA bulletin comes amid the continued fallout from an explosive article published Monday in The Atlantic. The publication's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, detailed how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth inadvertently disclosed war plans to him in an encrypted Signal chat group two hours before the U.S. military launched attacks against Houthi militia in Yemen. Goldberg wrote that Hegseth's messages included \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\"",
      "The NSA is an arm of the Defense Department and specializes in signals intelligence \u2014 which is derived from electronic transmissions \u2014 and cybersecurity. The agency is responsible for monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for U.S. national security interests.",
      "The unclassified but for-official-use-only documents provided to CBS News by a senior U.S. intelligence official are entitled \"Signal Vulnerability\" and were sent out the month before Goldberg was accidentally added to the group chat allegedly by national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin begins.",
      "The bulletin warned of Russian professional hacking groups employing phishing scams to gain access to encrypted conversations, bypassing the end-to-end encryption the application uses.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",
      "CBS News contacted the NSA for comment but did not receive a reply prior to publication.",
      "Signal responded to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were reportedly in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate panel.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. But the NSA bulletin advises that even information that is not categorized as classified should not be shared on Signal, advising users not to share \"unclassified, nonpublic\" information on the messaging platform.",
      "Ratcliffe said Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials. The group chat, Ratcliffe said, was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were asked by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",

      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked the arrest and deportation of a 21-year-old Columbia University student and legal permanent resident who has been involved in pro-Palestinian protests.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have been looking for Yunseo Chung, who came to the U.S. with her family from South Korea at the age of 7, since earlier this month, including by visiting her parents' residence and telling her lawyer that there's an administrative warrant for her arrest, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court.",
      "ICE issues so-called administrative warrants against noncitizens accused of immigration violations. They are not signed by judges.",
      "On Tuesday, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, who was nominated in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, granted Chung's attorneys a temporary restraining order, preventing her from being arrested or deported.",
      "Buchwald also ordered that if the Trump administration tries to detain Chung \"on any asserted basis other than pursuing her removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(4)(C)... Defendants-Respondents are ordered to provide sufficient advance notice to the Court and counsel, in order to enable Plaintiff Petitioner an opportunity to be heard regarding whether any such asserted basis for detention constitutes a pretext for First Amendment retaliation.\"",
      "The lawsuit says the actions by ICE and other officials started \"mere days\" after Chung was arrested and given an \"obstruction of governmental administration\" citation by the New York Police Department during a March 5 protest over Columbia University taking disciplinary actions against certain students who had been involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "Her lawyers argue the administration is targeting Chung because of her political speech, citing the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian activist who was arrested by ICE earlier this month and who the government is trying to deport.",
      "\"Now, officials at the highest echelons of government are attempting to use immigration enforcement as a bludgeon to suppress speech that they dislike, including Ms. Chung's speech,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "\"The case challenges the Trump administration's alarming new policy of using immigration law to target noncitizens  who engage in protest or advocacy in support of Palestinian rights, part of a series of authoritarian actions through which the administration seeks to silence political viewpoints it opposes,\" the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area, which filed the lawsuit, said in a statement. \"Speech concerning political change receives the highest level of  protection under the First Amendment, which the Supreme Court for nearly a century has interpreted to protect noncitizens.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday confirmed to CBS News it is seeking to deport Chung, saying she \"has engaged in concerning conduct,\" and characterized the March 5 protest as \"pro-Hamas.\"",
      "\"She is being sought for removal proceedings under the immigration laws,\" DHS said. \"Chung will have an opportunity to present her case before an immigration judge.\"",
      "Chung's lawyers said the government is trying to revoke their client's green card and eventually deport her through the same rarely used immigration law that officials have invoked to justify Khalil's detention \u2014 although the Justice Department has also since accused Khalil of immigration fraud. That law allows the secretary of state to make noncitizens subject to deportation if he determines their presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S.",
      "Chung's attorneys called the idea that her speech in support of Palestinians could jeopardize U.S. foreign policy \"a preposterous proposition.",

      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.",
      "The White House\u00a0previously said\u00a0the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would\u00a0 visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"",
      "But the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base   in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "The vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.",
      "\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee voted on Tuesday to advance the nomination of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former heart surgeon and television host, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The panel voted 14 to 13 along party lines to advance Oz's nomination, which now heads to the full Senate.",
      "Oz appeared before the committee\u00a0earlier this month. If confirmed, the 64-year-old would oversee the nearly $1.5 trillion the federal government spends on Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 health insurance programs that make up a large amount of the budget and have often been wielded as political cudgels.",
      "Oz has widespread name recognition as the host of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University. After the show stopped taping in 2022, Oz ran for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where he was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman.",
      "The former television host has touted meetings with key Republican senators on his path to confirmation, some of whom praised him during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. The committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, voiced his support for Oz ahead of the vote Tuesday, saying he has \"years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate.\" Crapo added that the background makes Oz \"uniquely qualified\" for the role, while urging the panel to advance the nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats criticized Oz during the hearing, alleging that he had dodged taxes. The criticism added to earlier critiques among Democrats of his views toward abortion and concerns about conflicts of interests. Oz has pledged to resign from positions he holds at companies, including a drugmaker and supplement company, while divesting from healthcare companies as part of his ethics agreement.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, argued ahead of the vote Tuesday that given the chance to \"assure the American people that he would not be a a rubber stamp for Republican plans to gut Medicaid and hike Affordable Care Act premiums\" during Oz's confirmation hearing, \"at every turn he failed the test.\" Wyden encouraged his colleagues to oppose the nomination, claiming that Oz has shown no ability or interest in \"pushing back on the dangerous Trump healthcare agenda.\"",
      "The vote comes as the Finance Committee voted narrowly to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as Health and Human Services secretary in February. Kennedy would serve as Oz's supervisor if he's confirmed.",

    "summary": "As top Trump Cabinet members sent texts in a Signal group chat, CBS News analysis shows one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic.",
      "The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report on Tuesday, saying on X that no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday for a pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats. Ratcliffe acknowledged at the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however, and the Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

    "story": [
      "Masih Alinejad, a journalist and prominent critic of the Iranian regime, was in the garden of her Brooklyn home when she locked eyes with the hitman hired to assassinate her. It was late July, and she had gone into her garden to pick vegetables.",
      "\"He was gigantic,\" she later testified in federal district court in Manhattan at the trial of the men who plotted to kill her. \"He was in the sunflowers staring into my eyes.\"",
      "Though she eyed him with some suspicion, she also thought he might be taking pictures of her garden of \"beautiful sunflowers.\"",
      "\"Every curse that I hear, I plant a flower,\" she explained, referring to threats she's endured for criticizing the Islamic Republic. \"That's why I have a massive garden. A lot of cursing and threats.\"",
      "The man in her garden, Khalid Mehdiyev, had been directed to kill Alinejad by fellow members of a Russian mob organization known as Thieves-in-Law, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, prosecutors said. In his car was an AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition. Prosecutors said that Iran's government had offered Amirov and Omarov a $500,000 bounty.",
      "On July 28, 2022, this murder-for-hire scheme involving Russian mobsters and the Iranian regime targeting a defiant dissident was foiled in Brooklyn. Alinejad, who has wild curls and often wears a white flower in her hair, is also an activist and leader of the movement to free Iran's women from the compulsory hijab.",
      "This was only one of the Iranian regime's several attempts to assassinate or kidnap Alinejad. One alleged assassination planner targeted not just Alinejad, but also President Trump during his 2024 campaign last fall. Farhad Shakeri is accused of being an \"asset\" of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who was tasked with devising a plan to kill Mr. Trump and recruiting two men to \"silence and kill, on U.S. soil, an American journalist,\" according to the indictment.",
      "While it was not the first attempt on her life, Amirov and Omarov were the first attempted assassins to go to trial in New York last week in a criminal case that provided a rare look into Iran's assassination attempts on U.S. soil. Prosecutors said high-ranking members of the IRGC were instructing Amirov and Omarov in the scheme. FBI agents detailed their analysis of devices and internet search histories tying Iranian intelligence officers to the plot. Through photographs, videos and messages, they illustrated the global network behind the attempted murder, with Medhiyev reporting his surveillance progress to Omarov and Amirov as he updated them from Brooklyn.",
      "\"We blocked it from both sides, it will be a show once she steps out of the house,\" messaged Medhiyev to Omarov, who then forwarded it to Amirov. \"God willing,\" he replied. In another plan, Medhiyev went to ask Alinejad for flowers from her garden, but she did not come to the door. Her Ring camera surveillance at one point showed him pacing back and forth on her porch before trying to open the door. Medhiyev was later stopped by police, who found the rifle and bullets in the backseat of his car.",
      "Last week, a federal jury found Omarov and Amirov guilty on all charges, including murder-for-hire and attempted murder in aid of racketeering. They face over 50 years in prison.",
      "\"I am being bombarded with emotion,\" Alinejad told CBS News over the phone shortly after the verdict, sounding tearful. \"I just need to cry now, I need to laugh, I need to dance. I just got the news now.\"",
      "\"The real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,\" she said. \"I am waiting for the day when Ali Khamenei and his terrorist Revolutionary Guards face justice, I want them to be punished.\"",
      "Despite the attempts on her life, Alinejad said she will not be silenced in her fight against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"She has a mission,\" her husband Kambiz Foroohar told CBS News. \"And that mission is that the Islamic Republic is like ISIS. It's an evil regime. She feels like she's compelled to challenge it. Compulsory hijab is just one way of challenging the Islamic Republic.\"",

      "\"I have a lot of hair. It was not easy,\" she testified in court.",
      "She was a political journalist there for over a decade but admitted she was always crossing the \"red lines\" of what Iran's government would allow people to write about. In 2009, she fled Iran.",
      "\"I'm a journalist, so I couldn't just keep quiet,\" she said. \"I had no option but to leave Iran.\"",
      "Once in the United States, she took off her hijab. She posted a photo of herself jumping in the air on social media, reveling in the feeling of the wind in her hair. In Iran, she \"felt like a hostage.\"",
      "That was the beginning of her campaign against the compulsory hijab, which evolved into the White Wednesday movement. Every Wednesday, women in Iran would film videos of themselves walking unveiled, a peaceful protest against compulsion.",
      "\"Social media is like my weapon,\" Alinejad testified. \"My social media expos\u00e9.\"",
      "The Iranian regime reacted by calling her and unveiled women \"prostitutes,\" she said. They arrested hundreds of women.",
      "Iran's Revolutionary Court has threatened women with up to 10 years in prison for sharing protest videos with her. \"It's become a crime,\" she said, her voice cracking.",
      "The government has also accused Alinejad of being a foreign agent. \"Oh, all of them,\" she testified listing intelligence agencies: \"Agent of the CIA, agent of Mossad, Agent of MI6, agent of President Trump.\"",
      "In court, Alinejad broke down when the prosecution displayed a cartoon published in Iran's state-controlled newspaper depicting two dissidents hanging in the air and an image of Alinejad looking up at them fearfully. Both men, who held citizenship in Europe (one also had a U.S. green card) were kidnapped and executed by the Iranian regime. She testified in court that the caption read: \"Next: Masih Alinejad.\"",
      "\"Did you understand that to be about you?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied tearfully.",
      "By proxy, Alinejad's family in Iran has also become a target. In 2018, Iranian government officials tried to coerce relatives to lure her to Turkey, where they planned to capture her, offering a payment in exchange. The relatives did not accept.",
      "In 2019, her brother was arrested on charges of associating with her. He was sentenced to eight years in prison but released after two years.",
      "\"They can't reach her. They can reach her family.\" said Foroohar. \"So that's always a big concern. But the family is also brave. They're enduring it.\"",
      "In July 2021, four Iranian intelligence officials were charged with a kidnapping conspiracy \u2013 for developing plans to kidnap Alinejad and bring her back to Iran. They allegedly explored slipping her out of the U.S. by travel routes from Alinejad's home to the waterfront in Brooklyn, a maritime evacuation route involving speed boats, and maritime travel from New York to Venezuela, according to the indictment. The conspirators live in Iran, where they remain at large.",
      "The assassination attempts",
      "It is \"chilling\" how close Mehdiyev came to carrying out the plan to kill his wife, said Faroohar.",
      "Medhiyev testified at trial about seeing Alinejad on the porch as he walked by her home, but his gun was in the car. By the time he went back for it, she had left.",
      "\"I was there to try to kill the journalist,\" he admitted.",
      "Medhiyev was a key witness for the prosecution, but the defense tried to undermine his credibility, dubbing him the \"pizza delivery hitman\" after Medhiyev admitted on the stand that he had once planned a kidnapping while working at a pizza shop.",
      "\"As you're coordinating an international kidnapping you're also working at a pizza shop?\" asked Omarov's defense attorney, Elena Fast. \"That's correct,\" he replied.",
      "On the day of his arrest, Mehdiyev had approached the door of Alinejad's home. At the time she was on a Zoom call with Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo Lopez and Russian chess player Garry Kasparov. She heard someone on the porch but did not go downstairs.",
      "\"She said, 'I don't know who that is but this call is more important,'\" Lopez recounted over Whatsapp.",
      "\"It was the Zoom call that saved her life,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, Medhiyev had sent Omarov a video of him opening a suitcase in the back of his car with an AK-47 style rifle inside. A caption read, \"we are ready.\" Amirov replied, \"keep the car clean.\"",
      "Police arrested Mehdiyev nearby that day after he ran a stop sign. In the back of his car, they discovered the AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition.",
      "Foroohar received a call at work from the FBI asking to \"whisk me away to a safe location.\" He and Alinejad were later told that a man with an AK-47 had been arrested outside their home.",
      "\"It's quite stressful. It's quite scary,\" admitted Foroohar, when asked what it felt like to live under threat. \"At the same time if you think about it too much, you are just paralyzed. So you compartmentalize.\"",
      "\"It's not easy. Sometimes you look over your shoulder,\" he added. \"Sometimes you just learn how to trust.\"",
      "Alinejad and her husband have lived in so many safe houses that they lost track. She has only been back to their Brooklyn home once to make sure the neighbors are watering her garden.",
      "In 2024, it was under surveillance again.",
      "On Nov. 7, Shakeri \u2014 the man assigned to assassinate both Mr. Trump and Alinejad \u2014\u00a0along with Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt were indicted for their alleged involvement in a second murder-for-hire plot on Alinejad's life. Rivera and Loadholt are accused of surveilling her Brooklyn home for months, with the intent to locate and kill her. The Justice Department charged Shakeri with directing \"a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets.\"",
      "\"It was very shocking and surprising,\" said Foroohar. \"We thought the whole thing was over and done with. And we don't know when the next one is. We had a conversation with members of the Biden administration, and they said, you better get used to this because Iran is very determined to get rid of Masih, and they're not going to give up.\""

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has quietly paused the processing of green card applications filed by certain individuals, including approved refugees, as part of a broader effort to more aggressively vet immigrants, multiple sources familiar with the move told CBS News.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, recently directed officials to suspend processing of requests for legal permanent residency submitted by immigrants granted refugee or asylum status, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss an action that has not been publicly reported.",
      "The move will, for the time being, place in legal limbo immigrants who were granted refuge in the U.S. because they proved they could be persecuted in their home countries.",
      "Refugees are granted entry into the U.S. after an overseas and exhaustive process of security checks, medical screenings and interviews that typically takes years to complete. Asylees are foreigners in the U.S. who are granted protection by immigration judges or asylum officers. Both populations have to prove they could face persecution because of certain characteristics, such as their political views, race or religion.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted both congressionally enacted programs, suspending the refugee process and closing the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border through executive orders that are currently facing federal court challenges.",
      "In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the green card processing pause is needed to comply with two executive actions issued by President Trump, including one that questioned immigration vetting procedures under the Biden administration.",
      "\"USCIS is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment\" with Mr. Trump's executive actions, DHS said in the statement. \"Adjustment of status\" is the official name of the green card process.",
      "In one of the presidential proclamations cited by officials, Mr. Trump instructed federal agencies to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States.\"",
      "The other executive order cited by officials paved the way for the State Department to designate Mexican cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The pause on some green card applications is the latest action taken by the Trump administration to restrict, tighten and, in some cases, suspend legal immigration procedures on the basis of concerns about national security and fraud.",
      "Last month, the administration, citing vetting and fraud concerns, paused all immigration applications filed by immigrants from Latin America and Ukraine who arrived in the U.S. under two Biden-era programs that relied on an authority known as humanitarian parole. The government did not announce that move publicly, but CBS News disclosed it on Feb. 19.",
      "The administration said last week it would give over half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came to the U.S. under one of the programs 30 days to self-deport or face arrest and deportation. Trump officials have claimed the migrants were \"loosely vetted\" by the Biden administration and noted the program was plagued by fraud concerns.",
      "Trump administration officials have also announced plans to more heavily scrutinize and review the social media accounts of immigrants applying for legal status, including U.S. citizenship, green cards and asylum. USCIS said the vetting of social media accounts is required for \"the enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening.\"",
      "The agency has long reviewed the social media information of immigrants applying for certain immigration benefits, but the new plan would require those applicants to submit their social media accounts, or handles, to the government for review.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was his country's understanding that the Black Sea agreement was in effect immediately, and Russia's government also released a statement confirming that it had agreed to the terms.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the White House statement did not specify any actions to be taken if Russia violates the terms of the agreement, and he said Ukraine would appeal directly to the Trump administration for more weapons and more sanctions against Russia in such a case.",
      "\"In accordance with the agreement between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, the Russian and American sides agreed to ensure the implementation of the 'Black Sea Initiative,' which includes ensuring the safety of navigation in the Black Sea, the non-use of force and the prevention of the use of commercial vessels for military purposes while organizing appropriate control measures through the inspection of such vessels,\" the Kremlin said in a statement published by the Russian state-run news agency TASS.",
      "It said that in return for the Black Sea deal, the U.S. would \"help restore access for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports to the world market, reduce the cost of shipping insurance, and expand access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"",
      "The terms of the deal, as described by the Kremlin, appeared to be based largely on the previous Black Sea Grain Initiative, a limited ceasefire brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that Russia walked away from in 2023. Moscow claimed the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners weren't keeping up their end of the agreement in 2023, by blocking the export of some Russian agricultural products.",

    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",

      "Update: The White House announced Tuesday that agreements had been reached separately with both Russia and Ukraine to \"ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the  use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.\" The story below precedes the Trump administration's announcement of those agreements, which were confirmed by both Ukraine and Russia.",
      "The U.S. and Russia were expected to release a joint statement early Tuesday morning after discussions in Saudi Arabia aimed at achieving a Black Sea maritime ceasefire deal, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The statement was expected to come out at 4 a.m. in Washington, D.C., which is 11 a.m. in Moscow, two of the sources said, but that time came and went without any word from American officials.",
      "While the details of the expected statement were not clear, reports shared with the Trump administration from the U.S. technical team in Riyadh seemed optimistic, the sources had said.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters more than an hour after the statement had been expected, however, that Russian officials were still analyzing the information relayed back to Moscow by the Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"The content of the technical negotiations will definitely not be 'published.' This should not be expected,\" he said, characterizing the talks as \"negotiations with a deep dive into details.\"",
      "\"The reports made in the capital [by Russia's negotiators to the government] are being analyzed, and only then will it be possible to talk about some understandings,\" Peskov told reporters, adding that the dialogue between Russian and American officials would continue.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by Russia's state-run TASS news agency later Tuesday as saying Moscow would consider a new version of a previous Black Sea ceasefire deal with Ukraine, which was crafted to enable the safe shipment of grain products from Ukraine and Russia, but only with \"clear guarantees\" that he said could \"only be the result of an order from Washington\" to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Russian negotiator Grigory Karasin, in Riyadh, was cited earlier by TASS as saying Moscow would continue the \"useful\" talks with the U.S., and would seek to involve the U.N. and other nations.",
      "\"We talked about everything, it was an intense dialogue, not easy, but very useful for us and the Americans,\" Karasin said, according to TASS, adding that \"lots of problems were discussed\" during 12 hours of negotiations in a luxury hotel in Riyadh.",
      "Ukrainian officials were also briefed on the content of the U.S.-Russia talks, one of the sources told CBS News. French news agency AFP cited a Ukrainian source as saying Ukrainian and U.S. officials held another round of talks in Riyadh on Tuesday.",
      "\"The talks are over. All details will be announced later,\" the source told a small group of media, including AFP.",
      "The previous deal, called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey. Russia exited that agreement in 2023, claiming the U.S. and Ukraine's other international partners had not allowed Moscow to export some agricultural products in violation of the terms. Lavrov's remarks on Tuesday appeared to confirm that a new version of that limited agreement was being discussed, at least between the Russian and U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The State Department's Michael Anton and the White House National Security Council's Andrew Peek are among the U.S. officials who have been meeting with the Russian negotiators in Riyadh.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a ceasefire on \"aerial infrastructure\" went into effect immediately after Mr. Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The details of the agreement reached during that phone call have never been confirmed, but Moscow has said it involved an agreement to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, which it almost immediately accused Ukraine of breaching.\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0said Putin agreed\u00a0during their call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine, offering a different version of the deal from the Kremlin. Ukraine accused Russia within hours of breaching the agreement as described by Mr. Trump.",
      "Next on the agenda, Waltz said Sunday, was a maritime ceasefire to allow the movement of grain, fuel, and other goods.",
      "\"And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines, and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are. And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace,\" Waltz said.",

      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",
      "The National Association of Letter Carriers' president, Brian L. Renfroe, said in a statement Monday that the union stands ready to work with whomever the board selects as the next postmaster general.",
      "\"The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,\" Renfroe said.",

      "USPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.",
      "Critics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.",
      "DeJoy had introduced in 2021 a 10-year overhaul he has orchestrated\u00a0\u2014 including higher postal rates, slower standard delivery and fewer post offices \u2014 to stem the Postal Service's financial hemorrhaging. The USPS targeted a turn to profit in fiscal 2024 but instead reported two consecutive years of increasing losses.",

      "Washington \u2014 A number of lawmakers expressed outrage Monday after the editor of The Atlantic reported that he was accidentally included in a group chat\u00a0involving top Trump administration officials about the United States' highly sensitive war plans in Yemen.",
      "Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation. It is likely to become a topic of questioning as leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to testify about global security threats facing the country.",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the breach represents \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense\" he has ever seen.",

      "\"There are likely to be classified briefings about this soon,\" Wicker said, adding that his committee will \"absolutely\" look into it.",
      "In a\u00a0piece\u00a0published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.",
      "The Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.",
      "The National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "Hegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"",
      "Asked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"",
      "He added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"",
      "\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"",
      "House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"",

    "summary": "A personal attorney to President Trump for years, Alina Habba is known for her pugnacious defense in the media and in courtrooms.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced that he is appointing longtime ally Alina Habba to be New Jersey's top federal prosecutor. She has been a personal attorney to Mr. Trump for years, known for her pugnacious defense of him against the media and in courtrooms.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, his social media site. He said that Habba, a counselor to the president who has not previously worked as a prosecutor, \"will lead with the same diligence and conviction that has defined her career.\"",
      "Habba has been at Mr. Trump's side for four years, at first filing unique, combative lawsuits \u2014 such as a doomed 2021 effort seeking a court order halting an investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James. That investigation led to one of Habba's most high profile defenses of the president, then a civilian.",
      "\"I am honored to serve my home state of New Jersey as Interim U.S. Attorney and I am grateful to President Trump for entrusting me with this tremendous responsibility,\" Habba said to CBS News, before mentioning her previous clashes on Mr. Trump's behalf. \"Just like I did during my time as President Trump's personal attorney, I will continue to fight for truth and justice. We will end the weaponization of justice, once and for all.\"",
      "Habba was among a half dozen lawyers who argued for Mr. Trump and others during a three-month-long 2023 civil fraud trial that pitted Mr. Trump against James' office. The case landed Mr. Trump and other defendants from his company a nearly $500 million fraud liability, which they are appealing. The trial became a staging ground for an effort that would permeate his presidential campaign and first weeks in office: vilification of judges who cross Mr. Trump.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Habba, other lawyers and Mr. Trump himself seethed at what they claimed were unfair decisions by the judge. Outside, to gathered cameras, the perceived injustices became a rallying call for a nascent presidential campaign still months away from its first primary. Mr. Trump, Habba and others would rage against the magistrate.",
      "Habba's work during the trial also included perhaps the most important cross-examination of her career: a withering, hours-long questioning of Mr. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Mr. Trump was on hand to watch the show, as was James, as well as defense attorneys and Manhattan prosecutors set to spar months later in Mr. Trump's 2024 criminal trial.",
      "In a series of tense and testy exchanges, Habba got the former attorney to admit to lying under oath on multiple occasions. A member of Mr. Trump's legal team later told CBS News they believed Habba's work in the civil fraud case had buoyed their cause in the criminal matter.",
      "Christopher Kise, a former solicitor general of Florida who led Mr. Trump's team during the fraud case, lauded Habba on Monday. Like Habba and others who have worked for Mr. Trump, Kise highlighted conservatives' claim that there was a \"weaponization\" of the courts against Mr. Trump during the four years between his terms in office.",
      "\"Alina will be a zealous and tireless advocate for justice in the District of New Jersey and help ensure the focus is on fighting crime and protecting families instead of the weaponized practices of the prior administration,\" Kise said. \"She has time and again proven her ability to take on major issues and to persevere under intense and challenging circumstances.\"",
      "While working for Mr. Trump, Habba weathered significant losses without losing her place in his inner circle. The fraud judgment came within weeks of an $83 million hit when a civil federal jury found Mr. Trump liable for defamation against the writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Mr. Trump attended that trial as well. He and Habba chafed at yet another judge, insinuating inside the courtroom and declaring outside to reporters that they were being treated unfairly.",
      "By the spring of 2024, Mr. Trump's campaign was intrinsically tied to his time in court. The rhythm of his seven-week criminal trial in New York included daily visits to a gaggle of cameras, just outside the courtroom doors, where Mr. Trump and others sought to highlight what they saw as a \"rigged\" campaign against him.",
      "Habba wasn't a part of Mr. Trump's defense team, but she was a mainstay in the front row of the gallery. When the verdict was read, Habba and Mr. Trump's son Eric were the only people other than Secret Service in that row. All other staff and friends of the former and future president sat behind.",
      "After Mr. Trump became the first former or future president to be convicted of felonies \u2014 a verdict he is appealing \u2014 Habba started appearing on the campaign trail, becoming a near-constant presence advocating for Mr. Trump on television and on the stage.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump announced Habba as counselor to the president. She said Monday she would be leaving the White House to serve in New Jersey.",
      "The new job represents a homecoming for Habba, whose eponymous former law firm, Habba Madaio & Associates LLP, is based in Bedminster, New Jersey, just a few miles from one of the president's golf courses.",
      "It was at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster where the two first became acquainted. Mr. Trump went through scores of lawyers in the years since, but few have had Habba's staying power.",
      "Those years brought Habba from her firm of fewer than half a dozen attorneys to the White House. Now she returns to New Jersey where she'll lead an office of some 150 prosecutors.",

    "summary": "A redistricting battle over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned years and been before the Supreme Court twice already.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map\u00a0that was used in the 2024 elections and includes two majority-Black districts.",
      "The dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the recrafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.",
      "It was unclear following arguments whether the high court was inclined to preserve Louisiana's map for use in future elections. New district lines are drawn after every Census.",
      "The justices have in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities \u2014 mostly Southern \u2014 with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.",
      "But in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.",
      "The latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.",
      "\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting.",
      "The dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"",
      "The case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's six congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.",
      "That initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its six districts had to be majority-Black.",
      "The plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.",
      "It did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.",
      "Shortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.",
      "The Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.",
      "\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"",
      "The first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "But as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.",
      "The state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.",
      "\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"",
      "But during the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned how the high court is supposed to reconcile the state's acknowledgement that it took race into consideration to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act with the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "\"How do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role [in our laws]?\" he asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts also highlighted the shape of District 6, which he said runs from one corner of the state to another, \"picking up Black populations as it goes along.\"",
      "But several of the liberal justices appeared to support Louisiana's argument that it was motivated by politics when it drew the lines of District 6, and decided to draw its own map to protect incumbent lawmakers rather than continue with litigation and risk the district court implementing its own voting lines.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan said state lawmakers had good reason to create a second majority-minor district, given the lower court's order, and implemented a map that reflected its political considerations.",
      "\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room\" when drawing voting boundaries, she said.",
      "In their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.",
      "They also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.",
      "\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and his view was not raised during the arguments. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.",
      "Sarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.",
      "\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.",
      "On the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's six House seats.",
      "District 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"",
      "They also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.",
      "\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:17:12 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced Susan Monarez is to be elevated from her role as acting CDC director, after nominee David Weldon was withdrawn earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided to pick Susan Monarez to be the new nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making permanent the acting role she has served at the public health agency in recent months.",
      "Monarez would be named in place of Dr. David Weldon, a former Florida congressman whose nomination was withdrawn by the White House earlier this month over concerns that he didn't have the votes to clear the Senate confirmation process.",
      "\"As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future. Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement,\" the president\u00a0posted\u00a0on Truth Social, announcing the pick Monday afternoon.",
      "Monarez apparently beat out others who had been seen as contenders for the role, including former obstetrician-gynecologist and Texas congressman Michael Burgess. Weldon had also floated Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo for the role, calling for him to be at the top of Mr. Trump's list to replace him as the nominee.",
      "If confirmed, Monarez would be the first head of the CDC to be voted on by senators, under a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous directors of the agency were able to take the reins soon after they were picked by the president, without undergoing the confirmation process.",
      "Monarez, who was previously deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, has been serving as the CDC's acting head since January.",
      "She has been viewed as an unconventional pick for the role because previous interim directors have come from within the CDC's career ranks.",
      "Past directors in recent history have also been medical doctors, while Monarez has a PhD. An acting director in the 1980s and 90s was also not a medical doctor, though he was a longtime career CDC official.",
      "According to one federal health official, White House officials have said they are trying to \"get it right\" with their new pick. Another federal official said that Monarez had gotten along well with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, since taking on the role.",
      "Monarez and her aides at the agency were in Washington, D.C., last week for meetings, one federal health official said.",
      "\"CDC needs reform. That's why I launched a Senate Republican CDC working group. I look forward to meeting Dr. Susan Monarez and learning more about her vision for the agency,\" Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate's health committee, said in a statement.",
      "People familiar with Weldon's meetings on Capitol Hill said Republicans had been frustrated with a lack of detailed priorities or familiarity with the agency's workings, as well as an unwillingness to assusage concerns that he would be perceived as anti-vaccine.",
      "Nominees to lead the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are expected to be confirmed soon, after hearings in recent weeks.",
      "Monarez is likely to face questions over the role she's played in controversial decisions at the agency in recent months, including undermining the independence of the CDC's flagship medical research publication, abruptly delaying a meeting of the outside vaccine advisers and plans to research whether vaccines cause autism \u2014 long after its scientists had debunked the claims.",
      "A range of health threats are now facing the CDC, including a rise in measles cases driven by a record outbreak among undervaccinated communities in Texas and neighboring states.",
      "Like other nominees, Monarez will face questions over whether she agrees with condemnation by health experts of Kennedy's responses to the outbreak, like remarks downplaying the virus and inflating the risks posed by the measles vaccine. Kennedy has also faced criticism over his comments about how to handle other viruses, like the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "Monarez has also been involved in decisions over steep cuts to the agency's workforce expected in the coming days, which some managers expect could result in losing up to 30% of the CDC's staff.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 19:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" a judge told a government lawyer Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An appeals court judge said Monday that Nazis were treated better under the Alien Enemies Act than Venezuelan migrants removed from the U.S. and flown to El Salvador earlier this month.",
      "\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" Judge Patricia Millett said, admonishing the Justice Department during oral arguments.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" said Drew Ensign, the government's attorney",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged Tren de Aragua gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison did not have the chance to appear in court.",
      "The judge said the question at hand wasn't the use of the act, but rather, the right of detainees to have due process and challenge their status as accused members of the gang.",
      "Millett, appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said migrants may continue to be detained under the Alien Enemies Act, but they may not be deported until there is a decision on a preliminary injunction to stop the removals.",
      "\"No president has ever used this statute this way,\" Millett said. The Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three other times \u2014 during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. It has never been used when the U.S. was not at war. She raised concerns about the act's implementation by government employees who may have removed people to El Salvador who were not Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Judge Justin Walker asked Ensign whether individual hearings were required before deportations, as D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg had written in his order Monday.",
      "Ensign responded, \"I agree with part of that.\" Walker, a Trump nominee, pressed him on how that would work.",
      "\"There are some individualized Habeas hearings being heard in Texas,\" Walker said. He asked, \"If they can bring a habeas petition and say they're not a member of [Tren de Aragua] \u2026 how would they bring that habeas claim?\"",
      "Millett, too, asked Ensign about the men who were deported to El Salvador as gang members: \"Were people on planes last weekend given the ability to file habeas?\"",
      "The government responded that yes, the five plaintiffs were able to appear in court. But the plaintiffs were not on the deportation flights that are at the center of the case, and they remain in custody in Texas.",
      "Ensign said he did not know how many migrants are being held in the U.S. under the AEA and said those who are currently held are being detained under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Ensign argued habeas petitions to appeal detention could be filed on behalf of this class in Texas.",
      "\"When were they given notice that they were being detained as part of [Tren de Aragua]\" and how much notice was given before they were put on the plane, Millett asked.",
      "Ensign said the answers were not in the record. He told the appeals panel, \"We've agreed challenges to individual determinations can be brought.\"",
      "But Millett pressed him further, asking whether \"the government considers itself within its right to pack every member of this class on an airplane before there is a reasonable amount of time to file a habeas petition?\" Ensign did not respond immediately, but later said the statute does not require such notice \u2014 notice, that is, that they were being detained as Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Lee Gelernt of the ACLU claimed, \"There was no process,\" and migrants \"were designated [Tren de Aragua] without any advance notice and rushed onto planes.\" He said he would soon submit declarations reflecting this.",
      "The government also made the case before the appeals panel that it should be moved to another venue and that the president's decision to invoke the AEA was not reviewable.",
      "Ensign said the lower court's order blocking the Trump administration from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the act represented an \"enormous intrusion\" into presidential power.",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg on Monday rejected the government's motion to rescind his order regarding the administration's use of the AEA for deportations. He found the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of the case because they're entitled to due process and individual hearings.",
      "He also expressed doubt that Mr. Trump's use of the act for these deportations is lawful, writing, \"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion.'\"",
      "Judge Walker appeared to take the government's side about the venue where the case was brought, pointing out that the complaint, which is being heard in Washington, D.C., could have been filed in Texas, where the five original plaintiffs are in custody.",
      "Gelernt conceded the point, but argued \"this has all been done in secret,\" and it would not have enabled hearings to be held on an individual basis for all those accused of being gang members. The government has not released the names of the 238 men deported on two flights to El Salvador who are now being held in a maximum security terrorism prison, although CBS News reported their names last week.",
      "\"Absent a class [temporary restraining order], we would have had far more people sitting in a Salvadoran prison,\" Gelernt said.",
      "\"I think that's a tough precedent for you,\" Walker told Gelernt, because no suit was being brought in Texas, where the defendants were being held.",
      "\"No class member is seeking release,\" Gelernt responded. \"The government is using the act to try and short-circuit immigration proceedings.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely not trying to get anybody out of detention,\" Gelernt added.",
      "\"Can you \u2014 standing here \u2014 give us an example of a district court injunction that enjoined a national security operation that survived appeal?\" Walker asked.",
      "\"The implications of not giving people a chance to contest it are extraordinary,\" Gelernt replied.",
      "\"Many \u2014 if not most \u2014 of the people removed had no connection to the gang,\" Gelernt said, asking that Judge Boasberg be allowed to continue his work. He predicted the plaintiffs would end up \"on a plane\" following the trajectory of the other alleged Venezeulan gang members if the order blocking the use of the AEA is lifted.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

    "story": [
      "The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and former Columbia University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024, has raised questions about the rights of permanent residents in the United States.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident married to an American citizen, in New York on March 8. He is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil is not facing criminal charges. The Trump administration initially argued it could deport him on foreign policy grounds and later accused him of immigration fraud.",
      "Here's what to know about the rights of green card holders:",
      "What is a green card?",
      "A green card, or a Permanent Resident Card, allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Individuals can be eligible for a green card through family, employment, refugee status and other reasons.",
      "Most green cards are valid for 10 years and then need to be renewed, similar to how U.S. citizens need to renew their passports, explained David Leopold, an immigration law expert and partner at UB Greensfelder.",
      "\"The card expires, but the residency doesn't expire,\" he said, adding if a card is \"not renewed, there could be ramifications because you have to maintain the registration, but the status itself never expires assuming the person complies with the law.\"",
      "How can a green card be revoked?",
      "There are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card and be deported.",
      "\"Any green card holder can be subject to deportation depending on the situation,\" Leopold said.",
      "Most cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.",
      "A person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.",
      "Mukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"",
      "The severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"",
      "The procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, Mukherjee said.",
      "Under the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press. For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.",
      "Another reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.",
      "\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.",
      "Green card vs. citizenship",
      "A green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen, they would need to apply and meet various requirements.",
      "Do green card holders have the same rights as U.S. citizens?",
      "Everyone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "But, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.",
      "What is the Immigration and Nationality Act?",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.",
      "The act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"",
      "A government document filed on March 9 and obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration used this provision to argue Khalil is subject to removal from the United States.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged on March 11 that Khalil has distributed \"pro-Hamas\" flyers. Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist group that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, is responsible for the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Khalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the allegation he circulated pro-Hamas flyers is not true, and his attorney, Amy Greer, said in a statement his detention was illegal.",
      "\"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent, in violation of the First Amendment,\" Greer said.",
      "Matthew Boaz, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law, wrote in a Lawfare article\u00a0that \"one cannot simply be stripped of their residency, even by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"",
      "Cases alleging grounds for deportation go before a federal immigration judge, who works for the Department of Justice, \"so it's not an independent judiciary,\" Leopold said.",
      "\"The law requires that the government make its proof by clear and convincing evidence,\" which is the highest standard in civil law, but not as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases, Leopold explained.",
      "The particular foreign policy provision referenced by the administration is rarely used, Leopold said, calling it \"a vestige of the Cold War.\"",
      "The administration later cited other grounds to deport Khalil in a federal court filing on March 17, accusing him of immigration fraud. The government alleges that on his green card paperwork, he did not disclose his work or involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office in the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "Where is Mahmoud Khalil being held?",
      "Khalil was arrested in New York by federal immigration authorities. He was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey and then flown to another site in Jena, Louisiana, his lawyers said.",
      "\"Louisiana is home to several ICE detention facilities and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state,\" Robin Nunn, a legal analyst and trial attorney, told CBS News 24/7 on March 11.",

      "Love's family posted news of her death on Love's X account.",
      "She had undergone recent treatment for brain cancer and received immunotherapy as part of a clinical trial at Duke University's brain tumor center. Her daughter said earlier this month that the former lawmaker was no longer responding to treatment.",
      "Love died at her home in Saratoga Springs, Utah, according to a statement posted by the family.",
      "\"With grateful hearts filled to overflowing for the profound influence of Mia on our lives, we want you to know that she passed away peacefully,\" her family said. \"We are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences.\"",
      "Love's former colleagues in the House and fellow politicians from Utah paid tribute to her on Sunday and Monday.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox referred to Love as a \"true friend.\"",
      "\"Her legacy of service inspired all who knew her,\" Cox said in a statement. \"We pray for her family and mourn with them.\"",
      "\"Heavy heart with the passing of my friend and colleague, Mia Love,\" former Utah Sen. Mitt Romney posted on social media. \"Her energy, enthusiasm and wit made her a stand-out member of Congress. Her faith and fortitude made her a model for me and for countless others. We will dearly miss you, Mia.\"",
      "Rep. Burgess Owens, who currently represents Love's district, posted on social media that he was \"heartbroken\" over her death.",
      "\"Today, while we grieve her loss, we also celebrate her tireless commitment to public service, her historic contributions, and the countless lives she touched through her work,\" Owens wrote.",
      "Love entered politics in 2003 after winning a seat on the city council in Saratoga Springs, a growing community about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City. She later became the city's mayor.",
      "In 2012, Love narrowly lost a bid for the House against the Democratic incumbent, former Rep. Jim Matheson, in a district that covers a string of Salt Lake City suburbs.",
      "She ran again two years later and defeated first-time candidate Doug Owens by about 7,500 votes.",
      "Love didn't emphasize her race during her campaigns, but she acknowledged the significance of her election after her 2014 victory. She said her win defied naysayers who had suggested that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman couldn't win a congressional seat in overwhelmingly White Utah.",
      "She was briefly considered a rising star within the GOP and she kept her distance from President Trump, who was unpopular with many Utah voters, while he was running for president ahead of the 2016 election.",
      "In 2016, facing reelection and following the release of a 2005 recording in which Mr. Trump made lewd comments about groping women, Love skipped the Republican National Convention and released a statement saying definitively that she would not vote for Mr. Trump. She instead endorsed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the GOP race, but he dropped out months later.",
      "While seeking a third term in 2018, Love tried to separate herself from Mr. Trump on trade and immigration while still backing her party's positions on tax cuts. Despite Republican voters outnumbering Democrats by a nearly three-to-one margin in her district, though, she lost by fewer than 700 votes to former Salt Lake City Mayor Ben McAdams, a Democrat.",
      "Mr. Trump called out Love by name in a news conference the morning after she lost, where he also bashed other Republicans who didn't fully embrace him.",
      "\"Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\"",
      "After her loss, Love served as a political commentator on CNN and as a fellow at the University of Sydney.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's election in November, Love said she was \"OK with the outcome.\"",
      "\"Yes, Trump says a lot of inconsiderate things that are unfortunate and impossible to defend. However, his policies have a high probability of benefiting all Americans,\" Love wrote in a social media post.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to pause a lower court decision requiring six agencies to reinstate more than 16,000 federal probationary workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to pause a lower court decision that required six agencies to reinstate more than 16,000 federal probationary workers who were terminated.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Justice Department is the latest intervention the administration is seeking from the Supreme Court as it faces more than 100 lawsuits challenging President Trump's policies. Already pending before the justices is a request to narrow injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. A decision on that request isn't expected until early next month.",
      "The latest bid from the Trump administration arose out of U.S. District Judge William Alsup's order earlier this month that required six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury \u2014 to reinstate probationary workers who were fired last month.",
      "In the challenge brought by a group of labor unions and nonprofit groups, the judge said the terminations were likely unlawful because the Office of Personnel Management did not have the authority to direct the firings.",
      "But in the request to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote that the court's preliminary injunction let third parties \"hijack the employment relationship between the federal government and its workforce.\"",
      "\"And, like many other recent orders, the court's extraordinary reinstatement order violates the separation of powers, arrogating to a single district court the Executive Branch's powers of personnel management on the flimsiest of grounds and the hastiest of timelines,\" she wrote. \"That is no way to run a government.\"",
      "Alsup's order covers roughly 16,000 federal workers who were still in probationary status, or those generally in a one- or two-year trial period. A federal appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to halt the decision, leading the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court for relief.",
      "\"This court should not allow a single district court to erase Congress's handiwork and seize control over reviewing federal personnel decisions \u2014 much less to do so by vastly exceeding the limits on the scope of its equitable authority and ordering reinstatements en masse,\" Harris wrote.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the district court's order forces the government to embark on a \"massive administrative undertaking\" to reinstate and onboard thousands of fired employees in just a few days.",
      "The firings of probationary workers came as part of Mr. Trump's broad initiative to shrink the size of the federal government, an effort that is being undertaken by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "More than 24,000 probationary workers were removed from their positions as part of the mass firings, the Justice Department revealed in a court filings submitted in a separate case challenging the terminations, which was brought in Maryland and involves 18 agencies.",
      "The judge overseeing that case also temporarily blocked the mass firings and ordered the affected federal workers at the agencies to be reinstated.",
      "As the legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda make their way through the federal courts, the president and his Republican allies have launched attacks on district court judges who have issued temporary orders blocking enforcement of the policies while proceedings move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have repeatedly called for some of the judges to be impeached, though it's unlikely any effort to remove them would be successful. But the president and GOP lawmakers have also condemned the relief the judges are issuing, and particularly the fact that they apply nationwide.",
      "In Supreme Court filings in the case involving Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order, Harris urged the justices to rein in the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "\"Government-by-universal-injunction has persisted long enough, and has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks,\" she wrote. \"It is long past time to restore district courts to their 'proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role \u2026 in a democratic society.'\"",
      "Harris reiterated that request Monday in the dispute over the mass firings of federal workers, urging the high court to \"end the interbranch power grab.\"",
      "\"Those orders have sown chaos as the Executive Branch scrambles to meet immediate compliance deadlines by sending huge sums of government money out the door, reinstating thousands of lawfully terminated workers, undoing steps to restructure Executive Branch agencies, and more,\" she wrote. \"The lower courts should not be allowed to transform themselves into all-purpose overseers of Executive Branch hiring, firing, contracting, and policymaking.\"",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "summary": "President Trump told reporters he does not believe national security adviser Mike Waltz should apologize for inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal group chat.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday defended national security adviser Mike Waltz as his administration faces questions about its use of the encrypted messaging app Signal after a reporter was mistakenly added to a group chat detailing highly sensitive plans to attack Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that the information that was discussed on the 18-member group chat, which included high-ranking officials like Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, was not classified and said Waltz is a \"very good man\" who will \"continue to do a good job.\"",
      "\"I don't think he should apologize. I think he's doing his best,\" the president said of Waltz. \"It's equipment and technology that's not perfect and probably he won't be using it again, at least not in the very near future.\"",
      "Speaking to Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night, Waltz called the situation \"embarrassing\" and said he takes \"full responsibility,\" adding that he \"built\" the Signal chat group.",
      "However, he claimed that he did not have Goldberg's contact information on his phone and is unsure how Goldberg's number got there, or how Goldberg got into the chat.",
      "\"I don't text him, he wasn't on my phone,\" Waltz said. \"And we're going to figure out how this happened.\"",
      "Waltz also said that a staffer did not put Goldberg's contact information into the phone.",
      "The Trump administration's use of the app to detail the plans to bomb Houthi targets on March 15 was revealed Monday by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, who wrote in a piece that he was added to a chat on Signal by an account that shared Waltz's name earlier this month.",
      "Several days later, an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out plans for strikes in Yemen, which included information about \"weapons packages, targets and timing\" shortly before the attack took place, Goldberg wrote.",
      "Among those included in the chat were accounts that appeared to belong to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg's account. Witkoff was in Moscow when he was added to the group chat, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting found.",
      "Hegseth denied any war plans were discussed, but the National Security Council said in a statement to CBS News on Monday that the message thread detailed by Goldberg \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "The breach sparked immediate condemnation of the Trump administration from congressional Democrats and raised questions about the use of Signal on government or personal devices, as well as whether top U.S. officials were sharing classified information.",
      "In a letter sent to Mr. Trump Tuesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, \"Hegseth should be fired immediately.\"",
      "\"The so-called Secretary of Defense recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans\u2014including the timing of a pending attack, possible strike targets and the weapons to be used\u2014during an unclassified national security group chat that inexplicably included a reporter,\" Jeffries wrote. \"His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters that he believes his administration will limit its use of Signal in the future, though he acknowledged that \"a lot of people\" across the federal government rely on the app.",
      "\"I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again,\" he said. \"We may be forced to use it. We may be in a situation where you need speed as opposed to gross safety and may be forced to use it. Generally speaking, I think we won't be using it very much.\"",
      "The president questioned whether the app has vulnerabilities that allow other users to hack into conversations.",
      "\"I think Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able to break into a system,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Waltz said technical experts and legal teams will look into the issue.",
      "\"Of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible,\" he said. \"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger.\"",
      "Waltz later attacked Goldberg and claimed he and other reporters in Washington, D.C., have \"made big names for themselves making up lies about this president.\"",
      "\"This one in particular I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we're looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room,\" he said.",
      "Waltz told the president that Goldberg is attempting to deflect attention away from the \"freedom that you're enabling,\" and said \"the world owes President Trump a favor.\"",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard both appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier Tuesday and faced questions from senators about the controversy. The two denied classified information was exchanged in the group chat, but Ratcliffe confirmed he was a participant in the thread.",
      "Ratcliffe added that Signal was on his agency computer when he took the helm of the CIA earlier this year and said it's \"permissible\" to use it to communicate and coordinate \"for work purposes.\"",

      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",
      "Bisignano has served as Fiserv's chief executive since July 2020, and the company has seen strong growth during his tenure. Fiserv's stock price, which was around $100 when Bisignano took the helm, has more than doubled since then. The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA.

      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors.

      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",

      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

      "The Trump administration invoked a state secrets privilege Monday and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under war authorities.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process. It's a case that has become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and the federal courts.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift Boasberg's order and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the judges.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said Nazis detained in the U.S. during World World II received better legal treatment than Venezuelan immigrants who were were deported to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett is one of three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "President Trump's administration appealed after Boasberg blocked those deportations and ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's arguments that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg. In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",
      "Just after midnight Monday, Trump posted a social media message questioning Boasberg's impartiality and calling for him to be disbarred.",

A health department spokesperson did not share where the individual boarded the train, but Amtrak transit\u00a0schedules\u00a0show the route started in Boston, reached New York City a little before 7:30 p.m., and stopped in numerous other cities along the East Coast, including Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore, before reaching D.C.",

An adult with measles also died in New Mexico.",

The CDC warns that roughly 1 of every 1,000 children with measles develops brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and as many as 3 of every 1,000 children with measles dies from the disease.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.",
      "The White House\u00a0previously said\u00a0the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would\u00a0 visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"",
      "But the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base   in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "The vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.",
      "\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\"",

    "summary": "The Senate Finance Committee voted to advance the nomination of Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee voted on Tuesday to advance the nomination of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former heart surgeon and television host, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The panel voted 14 to 13 along party lines to advance Oz's nomination, which now heads to the full Senate.",
      "Oz appeared before the committee\u00a0earlier this month. If confirmed, the 64-year-old would oversee the nearly $1.5 trillion the federal government spends on Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 health insurance programs that make up a large amount of the budget and have often been wielded as political cudgels.",
      "Oz has widespread name recognition as the host of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University. After the show stopped taping in 2022, Oz ran for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where he was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman.",
      "The former television host has touted meetings with key Republican senators on his path to confirmation, some of whom praised him during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. The committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, voiced his support for Oz ahead of the vote Tuesday, saying he has \"years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate.\" Crapo added that the background makes Oz \"uniquely qualified\" for the role, while urging the panel to advance the nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats criticized Oz during the hearing, alleging that he had dodged taxes. The criticism added to earlier critiques among Democrats of his views toward abortion and concerns about conflicts of interests. Oz has pledged to resign from positions he holds at companies, including a drugmaker and supplement company, while divesting from healthcare companies as part of his ethics agreement.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, argued ahead of the vote Tuesday that given the chance to \"assure the American people that he would not be a a rubber stamp for Republican plans to gut Medicaid and hike Affordable Care Act premiums\" during Oz's confirmation hearing, \"at every turn he failed the test.\" Wyden encouraged his colleagues to oppose the nomination, claiming that Oz has shown no ability or interest in \"pushing back on the dangerous Trump healthcare agenda.\"",
      "The vote comes as the Finance Committee voted narrowly to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as Health and Human Services secretary in February. Kennedy would serve as Oz's supervisor if he's confirmed.",
      "With the advancement out of committee, Oz's confirmation would move to the Senate floor, where Republicans can afford to lose three votes to confirm him without support from across the aisle, with Vice President J.D. Vance serving as a tie-breaker.",

    "summary": "As top Trump Cabinet members sent texts in a Signal group chat, CBS News analysis shows one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic.",
      "The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report on Tuesday, saying on X that no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday for a pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats. Ratcliffe acknowledged at the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however, and the Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

    "summary": "Masih Alinejad, a prominent critic of the regime, is a leader of the movement to free Iranian women from the compulsory hijab and has drawn the ire of Iran's Supreme Leader.",
    "story": [
      "Masih Alinejad, a journalist and prominent critic of the Iranian regime, was in the garden of her Brooklyn home when she locked eyes with the hitman hired to assassinate her. It was late July, and she had gone into her garden to pick vegetables.",
      "\"He was gigantic,\" she later testified in federal district court in Manhattan at the trial of the men who plotted to kill her. \"He was in the sunflowers staring into my eyes.\"",
      "Though she eyed him with some suspicion, she also thought he might be taking pictures of her garden of \"beautiful sunflowers.\"",
      "\"Every curse that I hear, I plant a flower,\" she explained, referring to threats she's endured for criticizing the Islamic Republic. \"That's why I have a massive garden. A lot of cursing and threats.\"",
      "The man in her garden, Khalid Mehdiyev, had been directed to kill Alinejad by fellow members of a Russian mob organization known as Thieves-in-Law, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, prosecutors said. In his car was an AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition. Prosecutors said that Iran's government had offered Amirov and Omarov a $500,000 bounty.",
      "On July 28, 2022, this murder-for-hire scheme involving Russian mobsters and the Iranian regime targeting a defiant dissident was foiled in Brooklyn. Alinejad, who has wild curls and often wears a white flower in her hair, is also an activist and leader of the movement to free Iran's women from the compulsory hijab.",
      "This was only one of the Iranian regime's several attempts to assassinate or kidnap Alinejad. One alleged assassination planner targeted not just Alinejad, but also President Trump during his 2024 campaign last fall. Farhad Shakeri is accused of being an \"asset\" of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who was tasked with devising a plan to kill Mr. Trump and recruiting two men to \"silence and kill, on U.S. soil, an American journalist,\" according to the indictment.",
      "While it was not the first attempt on her life, Amirov and Omarov were the first attempted assassins to go to trial in New York last week in a criminal case that provided a rare look into Iran's assassination attempts on U.S. soil. Prosecutors said high-ranking members of the IRGC were instructing Amirov and Omarov in the scheme. FBI agents detailed their analysis of devices and internet search histories tying Iranian intelligence officers to the plot. Through photographs, videos and messages, they illustrated the global network behind the attempted murder, with Medhiyev reporting his surveillance progress to Omarov and Amirov as he updated them from Brooklyn.",
      "\"We blocked it from both sides, it will be a show once she steps out of the house,\" messaged Medhiyev to Omarov, who then forwarded it to Amirov. \"God willing,\" he replied. In another plan, Medhiyev went to ask Alinejad for flowers from her garden, but she did not come to the door. Her Ring camera surveillance at one point showed him pacing back and forth on her porch before trying to open the door. Medhiyev was later stopped by police, who found the rifle and bullets in the backseat of his car.",
      "Last week, a federal jury found Omarov and Amirov guilty on all charges, including murder-for-hire and attempted murder in aid of racketeering. They face over 50 years in prison.",
      "\"I am being bombarded with emotion,\" Alinejad told CBS News over the phone shortly after the verdict, sounding tearful. \"I just need to cry now, I need to laugh, I need to dance. I just got the news now.\"",
      "\"The real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,\" she said. \"I am waiting for the day when Ali Khamenei and his terrorist Revolutionary Guards face justice, I want them to be punished.\"",
      "Despite the attempts on her life, Alinejad said she will not be silenced in her fight against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"She has a mission,\" her husband Kambiz Foroohar told CBS News. \"And that mission is that the Islamic Republic is like ISIS. It's an evil regime. She feels like she's compelled to challenge it. Compulsory hijab is just one way of challenging the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "\"Next: Masih Alinejad\"",
      "In Iran, Alinejad struggled to keep her wild curls hidden under a hijab.",
      "\"I have a lot of hair. It was not easy,\" she testified in court.",
      "She was a political journalist there for over a decade but admitted she was always crossing the \"red lines\" of what Iran's government would allow people to write about. In 2009, she fled Iran.",
      "\"I'm a journalist, so I couldn't just keep quiet,\" she said. \"I had no option but to leave Iran.\"",
      "Once in the United States, she took off her hijab. She posted a photo of herself jumping in the air on social media, reveling in the feeling of the wind in her hair. In Iran, she \"felt like a hostage.\"",
      "That was the beginning of her campaign against the compulsory hijab, which evolved into the White Wednesday movement. Every Wednesday, women in Iran would film videos of themselves walking unveiled, a peaceful protest against compulsion.",
      "\"Social media is like my weapon,\" Alinejad testified. \"My social media expos\u00e9.\"",
      "The Iranian regime reacted by calling her and unveiled women \"prostitutes,\" she said. They arrested hundreds of women.",
      "Iran's Revolutionary Court has threatened women with up to 10 years in prison for sharing protest videos with her. \"It's become a crime,\" she said, her voice cracking.",
      "The government has also accused Alinejad of being a foreign agent. \"Oh, all of them,\" she testified listing intelligence agencies: \"Agent of the CIA, agent of Mossad, Agent of MI6, agent of President Trump.\"",
      "In court, Alinejad broke down when the prosecution displayed a cartoon published in Iran's state-controlled newspaper depicting two dissidents hanging in the air and an image of Alinejad looking up at them fearfully. Both men, who held citizenship in Europe (one also had a U.S. green card) were kidnapped and executed by the Iranian regime. She testified in court that the caption read: \"Next: Masih Alinejad.\"",
      "\"Did you understand that to be about you?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied tearfully.",
      "By proxy, Alinejad's family in Iran has also become a target. In 2018, Iranian government officials tried to coerce relatives to lure her to Turkey, where they planned to capture her, offering a payment in exchange. The relatives did not accept.",
      "In 2019, her brother was arrested on charges of associating with her. He was sentenced to eight years in prison but released after two years.",
      "\"They can't reach her. They can reach her family.\" said Foroohar. \"So that's always a big concern. But the family is also brave. They're enduring it.\"",
      "In July 2021, four Iranian intelligence officials were charged with a kidnapping conspiracy \u2013 for developing plans to kidnap Alinejad and bring her back to Iran. They allegedly explored slipping her out of the U.S. by travel routes from Alinejad's home to the waterfront in Brooklyn, a maritime evacuation route involving speed boats, and maritime travel from New York to Venezuela, according to the indictment. The conspirators live in Iran, where they remain at large.",
      "The assassination attempts",
      "It is \"chilling\" how close Mehdiyev came to carrying out the plan to kill his wife, said Faroohar.",
      "Medhiyev testified at trial about seeing Alinejad on the porch as he walked by her home, but his gun was in the car. By the time he went back for it, she had left.",
      "\"I was there to try to kill the journalist,\" he admitted.",
      "Medhiyev was a key witness for the prosecution, but the defense tried to undermine his credibility, dubbing him the \"pizza delivery hitman\" after Medhiyev admitted on the stand that he had once planned a kidnapping while working at a pizza shop.",
      "\"As you're coordinating an international kidnapping you're also working at a pizza shop?\" asked Omarov's defense attorney, Elena Fast. \"That's correct,\" he replied.",
      "On the day of his arrest, Mehdiyev had approached the door of Alinejad's home. At the time she was on a Zoom call with Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo Lopez and Russian chess player Garry Kasparov. She heard someone on the porch but did not go downstairs.",
      "\"She said, 'I don't know who that is but this call is more important,'\" Lopez recounted over Whatsapp.",
      "\"It was the Zoom call that saved her life,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, Medhiyev had sent Omarov a video of him opening a suitcase in the back of his car with an AK-47 style rifle inside. A caption read, \"we are ready.\" Amirov replied, \"keep the car clean.\"",
      "Police arrested Mehdiyev nearby that day after he ran a stop sign. In the back of his car, they discovered the AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition.",
      "Foroohar received a call at work from the FBI asking to \"whisk me away to a safe location.\" He and Alinejad were later told that a man with an AK-47 had been arrested outside their home.",
      "\"It's quite stressful. It's quite scary,\" admitted Foroohar, when asked what it felt like to live under threat. \"At the same time if you think about it too much, you are just paralyzed. So you compartmentalize.\"",
      "\"It's not easy. Sometimes you look over your shoulder,\" he added. \"Sometimes you just learn how to trust.\"",
      "Alinejad and her husband have lived in so many safe houses that they lost track. She has only been back to their Brooklyn home once to make sure the neighbors are watering her garden.",
      "In 2024, it was under surveillance again.",
      "On Nov. 7, Shakeri \u2014 the man assigned to assassinate both Mr. Trump and Alinejad \u2014\u00a0along with Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt were indicted for their alleged involvement in a second murder-for-hire plot on Alinejad's life. Rivera and Loadholt are accused of surveilling her Brooklyn home for months, with the intent to locate and kill her. The Justice Department charged Shakeri with directing \"a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets.\"",
      "\"It was very shocking and surprising,\" said Foroohar. \"We thought the whole thing was over and done with. And we don't know when the next one is. We had a conversation with members of the Biden administration, and they said, you better get used to this because Iran is very determined to get rid of Masih, and they're not going to give up.\""

The remains were described as partially skeletal, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. They had also been scattered, police said, suggesting animal activity.

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has quietly paused the processing of green card applications filed by certain individuals, including approved refugees, as part of a broader effort to more aggressively vet immigrants, multiple sources familiar with the move told CBS News.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, recently directed officials to suspend processing of requests for legal permanent residency submitted by immigrants granted refugee or asylum status, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss an action that has not been publicly reported.",
      "The move will, for the time being, place in legal limbo immigrants who were granted refuge in the U.S. because they proved they could be persecuted in their home countries.",
      "Refugees are granted entry into the U.S. after an overseas and exhaustive process of security checks, medical screenings and interviews that typically takes years to complete. Asylees are foreigners in the U.S. who are granted protection by immigration judges or asylum officers. Both populations have to prove they could face persecution because of certain characteristics, such as their political views, race or religion.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted both congressionally enacted programs, suspending the refugee process and closing the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border through executive orders that are currently facing federal court challenges.",
      "In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the green card processing pause is needed to comply with two executive actions issued by President Trump, including one that questioned immigration vetting procedures under the Biden administration.",
      "\"USCIS is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment\" with Mr. Trump's executive actions, DHS said in the statement. \"Adjustment of status\" is the official name of the green card process.",
      "In one of the presidential proclamations cited by officials, Mr. Trump instructed federal agencies to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States.\"",
      "The other executive order cited by officials paved the way for the State Department to designate Mexican cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The pause on some green card applications is the latest action taken by the Trump administration to restrict, tighten and, in some cases, suspend legal immigration procedures on the basis of concerns about national security and fraud.",
      "Last month, the administration, citing vetting and fraud concerns, paused all immigration applications filed by immigrants from Latin America and Ukraine who arrived in the U.S. under two Biden-era programs that relied on an authority known as humanitarian parole. The government did not announce that move publicly, but CBS News disclosed it on Feb. 19.",
      "The administration said last week it would give over half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came to the U.S. under one of the programs 30 days to self-deport or face arrest and deportation.

      "Trump administration officials have also announced plans to more heavily scrutinize and review the social media accounts of immigrants applying for legal status, including U.S. citizenship, green cards and asylum. USCIS said the vetting of social media accounts is required for \"the enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening.\"",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

      "The National Park Service determines the cherry blossoms' \"peak bloom\" date by predicting when 70% of the blossoms on the Yoshino cherry trees, which are the most common type of cherry tree planted along the Tidal Basin, will be open.",
      "Typically, peak bloom occurs between the last week of March and the first week of April, according to the park service, which notes that forecasting the peak is impossible to do more than 10 days ahead of time. The average peak bloom date falls on April 3, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which similarly advises that the exact timing varies from year to year because warmer temperatures can encourage an earlier bloom.",
      "Peak bloom is expected to happen sooner than the average date in 2025, with the park service estimating it will occur at some point between this Friday, March 28, and next Monday, March 31. The Yoshino trees usually bloom over the course of multiple days.",

      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state.

      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

      "The U.S. and Russia were expected to release a joint statement early Tuesday morning after discussions in Saudi Arabia aimed at achieving a Black Sea maritime ceasefire deal, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The statement was expected to come out at 4 a.m. in Washington, D.C., which is 11 a.m. in Moscow, two of the sources said, but that time came and went without any word from American officials.",
      "While the details of the expected statement were not clear, reports shared with the Trump administration from the U.S. technical team in Riyadh seemed optimistic, the sources had said.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters more than an hour after the statement had been expected, however, that Russian officials were still analyzing the information relayed back to Moscow by the Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"The content of the technical negotiations will definitely not be 'published.' This should not be expected,\" he said, characterizing the talks as \"negotiations with a deep dive into details.\"",
      "\"The reports made in the capital [by Russia's negotiators to the government] are being analyzed, and only then will it be possible to talk about some understandings,\" Peskov told reporters, adding that the dialogue between Russian and American officials would continue.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by Russia's state-run TASS news agency later Tuesday as saying Moscow would consider a new version of a previous Black Sea ceasefire deal with Ukraine, which was crafted to enable the safe shipment of grain products from Ukraine and Russia, but only with \"clear guarantees\" that he said could \"only be the result of an order from Washington\" to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Russian negotiator Grigory Karasin, in Riyadh, was cited earlier by TASS as saying Moscow would continue the \"useful\" talks with the U.S., and would seek to involve the U.N. and other nations.",

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify about global threats facing the U.S. However the annual hearing, which typically focuses on threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, largely concentrated on the lapse.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",

Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",

      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",

      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",

Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 16:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance said he \"didn't want her to have all that fun by herself.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance is joining his wife, second lady Usha Vance, on her visit to Greenland this week, he announced, a trip that will now focus on a U.S. Space Force base there.",
      "The White House\u00a0previously said\u00a0the second lady would arrive in Greenland Thursday and return on Saturday, and that she would\u00a0 visit \"historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.\"",
      "But the vice president's office now says the Vances will travel Friday to the Pituffik Space Base   in Greenland to receive a briefing on Arctic security issues and meet with U.S. service members, and the base visit will take place in lieu of the second lady's attendance at the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.",
      "The vice president's decision comes after Greenland's prime minister said planned trips there by top Trump officials are \"highly aggressive,\" and as President Trump isn't backing down on his hopes to acquire the semiautonomous territory of Denmark. National security adviser Mike Waltz has also been expected to visit Greenland soon.",
      "\"Hey guys, It's JD Vance, the vice president,\" Vance said in a video\u00a0posted to social media. \"And you know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her.\"",
      "\"I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland, and also just check out what's going on with the security there of Greenland,\" Vance continued. \"As you know, it's really important. A lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways, to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and, of course, to threaten the people of Greenland. So we're going to check out how things are going there.\"",
      "Vance didn't explicitly mention Mr. Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland, but said they want to \"reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland, because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, despite being rebuffed by local officials.",
      "Heather Conley, an expert on Arctic geopolitics and former deputy assistant secretary of state, told CBS Mornings the Trump administration is \"absolutely right\" that Greenland is strategic for the U.S. in protecting against Russian missiles and protecting U.S. airspace and maritime space, \"but if we're not careful, we're going to, unfortunately, have our allies fear us and resist increasing our security and prosperity right now.\"",
      "Conley said multiple U.S. administrations have contemplated purchasing Greenland, so Mr. Trump isn't the first. But NATO and a bilateral defense agreement with Denmark rendered that less necessary. And she's concerned the Trump administration's rhetoric will backfire.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, and this is what is really backfiring, this type of rhetoric,\" she said. \"Again, we have a phenomenal ally in the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlandic officials, that we have this rich history of defense cooperation. They are ready to increase defense spending. The Danish government has increased defense spending. They're going to probably do it again. Very focused on \u2014 on the Arctic, Arctic security. They're open for business for the United States. So that door is open. But when we sort of drop in private visits, we use this aggressive language now, officials are saying, you're provoking us. You are threatening our territorial integrity, our national security. What is going on here?\"",

    "summary": "As top Trump Cabinet members sent texts in a Signal group chat, CBS News analysis shows one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic.",
      "The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report on Tuesday, saying on X that no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday for a pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats. Ratcliffe acknowledged at the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however, and the Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

      "Russia and Ukraine have agreed to \"ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,\" the Trump administration said Tuesday, claiming a limited advance in efforts to broker a peace deal between the two countries.",
      "The agreements were announced in separate statements by the White House after U.S. officials held separate bilateral talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was his country's understanding that the Black Sea agreement was in effect immediately, and Russia's government also released a statement confirming that it had agreed to the terms.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the White House statement did not specify any actions to be taken if Russia violates the terms of the agreement, and he said Ukraine would appeal directly to the Trump administration for more weapons and more sanctions against Russia in such a case.",
      "\"In accordance with the agreement between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, the Russian and American sides agreed to ensure the implementation of the 'Black Sea Initiative,' which includes ensuring the safety of navigation in the Black Sea, the non-use of force and the prevention of the use of commercial vessels for military purposes while organizing appropriate control measures through the inspection of such vessels,\" the Kremlin said in a statement published by the Russian state-run news agency TASS.",
      "It said that in return for the Black Sea deal, the U.S. would \"help restore access for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports to the world market, reduce the cost of shipping insurance, and expand access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"",
      "The terms of the deal, as described by the Kremlin, appeared to be based largely on the previous Black Sea Grain Initiative, a limited ceasefire brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that Russia walked away from in 2023. Moscow claimed the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners weren't keeping up their end of the agreement in 2023, by blocking the export of some Russian agricultural products.",
      "The White House statements on Tuesday also said the U.S. agreed with Russia and Ukraine to \"develop measures for implementing\" agreements between President Trump and the two countries' leaders \"to ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine.\"",
      "On Sunday, national security adviser Mike Waltz said on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a ceasefire on \"aerial infrastructure\" went into effect immediately after Mr. Trump had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. The details of the agreement reached during that call haven't been confirmed, but Moscow has said it involved an agreement to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, which it almost immediately accused Ukraine of breaching.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0said Putin agreed\u00a0during their call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine, offering a different version of the deal from the Kremlin. Hours after the deal was announced, Ukraine\u00a0accused Russia\u00a0of breaching the agreement as described by Mr. Trump.",
      "Waltz had said on Sunday that a maritime ceasefire to allow the movement of grain, fuel, and other goods was next on the agenda.",
      "\"And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines, and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are. And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace,\" Waltz said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

Russia exited that agreement in 2023, claiming the U.S. and Ukraine's other international partners had not allowed Moscow to export some agricultural products in violation of the terms. Lavrov's remarks on Tuesday appeared to confirm that a new version of that limited agreement was being discussed, at least between the Russian and U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The State Department's Michael Anton and the White House National Security Council's Andrew Peek are among the U.S. officials who have been meeting with the Russian negotiators in Riyadh.",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a ceasefire on \"aerial infrastructure\" went into effect immediately after Mr. Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The details of the agreement reached during that phone call have never been confirmed, but Moscow has said it involved an agreement to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, which it almost immediately accused Ukraine of breaching.\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0said Putin agreed\u00a0during their call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine, offering a different version of the deal from the Kremlin. Ukraine accused Russia within hours of breaching the agreement as described by Mr. Trump.",
      "Next on the agenda, Waltz said Sunday, was a maritime ceasefire to allow the movement of grain, fuel, and other goods.",
      "\"And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines, and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are. And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace,\" Waltz said.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A number of lawmakers expressed outrage Monday after the editor of The Atlantic reported that he was accidentally included in a group chat\u00a0involving top Trump administration officials about the United States' highly sensitive war plans in Yemen.",
      "Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation. It is likely to become a topic of questioning as leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to testify about global security threats facing the country.",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the breach represents \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense\" he has ever seen.",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately,\" Reed's statement said.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"It's definitely a concern, and it appears that mistakes were made.\"",
      "\"There are likely to be classified briefings about this soon,\" Wicker said, adding that his committee will \"absolutely\" look into it.",
      "In a\u00a0piece\u00a0published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.",
      "The Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.",
      "The National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "Hegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"",
      "Asked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"",
      "He added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"",
      "\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"",
      "House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"",
      "Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act.",
      "Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans.",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",
      "\"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\"",
      "\"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.",

      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",

      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada and is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. The largest island in the world, but home to only around 60,000 people, it is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

But Han was impeached by the assembly as well in late December following political strife with opposition lawmakers.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country's top two officials intensified a domestic division and deepened worries about the country's diplomatic and economic activities. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, had since serving as acting president.",
      "On Monday, seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment. They ruled the accusations against him weren't against the law or weren't serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.",
      "Dismissing Han would have needed the support of at least six court justices.",
      "Following his reinstatement, Han told reporters he would focus on the \"most urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies. He also called for a national unity, saying \"there's no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\"",
      "The court has yet to rule on Yoon's impeachment. If the court upholds Yoon's impeachment, South Korea must hold a election for a new president. If it rules for him, Yoon will be restored to office and regain his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon was impeached about two weeks earlier than Han. Observers earlier predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon's case in mid-March but it hasn't done so.",
      "Yoon has been separately arrested and charged with rebellion in connection with his martial law decree. If convicted of that charge, he would face the death penalty or a life sentence. On March 8, Yoon was released from prison, after a Seoul district court allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing Yoon or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon's martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "At the center of squabbling over Yoon is why he sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after declaring martial law. Yoon says he aims to maintain order, but senior military and police officers sent there have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted it down unanimously.",
      "Han, a career diplomat who was appointed by Yoon, had attempted to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets, when he served as acting president. A major trigger for the opposition's push for his impeachment was Han's refusal to fill three vacancies on the nine-member Constitutional Court bench.",
      "Restoring the court's full membership was sensitive because a ruling upholding Yoon's impeachment requires support from at least six justices.",
      "Han's successor, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Both Han and Choi cited needing bipartisan consent to add justices to the court, but their critics suspected they were siding with Yoon's People Power Party, which wanted to increase Yoon's chances of returning to power. On Friday, the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion on Choi.",

      "Venezuela accepted the deal to guarantee the \"the return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their Human Rights,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",

      "\"Migrating is not a crime and we will not rest until we achieve the return of all those who require it and until we rescue our brothers kidnapped in El Salvador,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",

      "Maduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \"We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\" Maduro said.",
      "The Venezuelan leader also said that he held the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, responsible for the well-being of the Venezuelans deported to that country.",
      "\"You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\" Maduro said.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Documents obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.",
      "Maduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "In recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
      "The Trump administration said that the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo are members of Tren de Aragua, but offered little evidence to back this up.",

      "Sponges grow very slowly \u2014 sometimes less than two centimeters a year. To get this big, the scientists say, the ecosystem has been thriving for a long time \u2014 possibly even centuries.",
      "The remotely operated vehicle explored the seafloor for eight days, the institute said. It also discovered large corals and more sponges, which were supporting species including icefish, giant sea spiders and octopi.",
      "Esquete said that researchers are now studying how the ecosystem has been getting enough energy to function. Virmani suggested that ocean currents could be bringing nutrients to the area.",
      "Since January, scientists have confirmed the existence of at least six new species, Virmani said, but there are \"many more yet to be analyzed.\"",
      "Because Schmidt Ocean Institute makes all of its research, data and livestreams open access, the information is available for other scientists to explore and analyze.",

    "story": [
      "London's\u00a0Heathrow Airport \u2014 one of the busiest airports in the world \u2014 resumed some flights after being closed for most of Friday after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. An estimated 200,000 travelers were affected by the shutdown.",
      "The first plane landed around 6:30 p.m. local time, the Associated Press reported.",
      "\"We're running all flights as scheduled, including additional flights to support with reconnecting passengers and repositioning aircraft,\" a statement on Heathrow's website read early Saturday morning.",
      "British Airways, whose main hub is Heathrow, said eight long-haul flights were cleared to depart Friday evening.",
      "The airport said the fire late Thursday night at an electrical substation supplying the airport had caused a \"significant power outage,\" but on Friday afternoon, an airport spokesperson said teams had \"worked tirelessly since the incident to ensure a speedy recovery\" and that the facility was \"safely able to begin some flights later today.\" After the announcement, at least one plane could be seen taxiing.",
      "\"Please do not travel to the airport unless your airline has advised you to do so,\" the statement said. \"We will now work with the airlines on repatriating the passengers who were diverted to other airports in Europe. We hope to run a full operation tomorrow and will provide further information shortly.\"",
      "The spokesperson noted that, \"as the busiest airport in Europe, Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, therefore getting back to a full and safe operation takes time.\"",
      "Heathrow had initially said no flights would go in or out until the end of Friday, warning that it expected \"significant disruption over the coming days.\"",
      "At around 9 p.m. local time on Friday, approximately 5% of the fire near the airport was still burning, the London Fire Brigade said.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police said there was \"currently no indication of foul play,\" but that counterterrorism police would lead the investigation into the substation fire that shut down Europe's busiest airport.",
      "The London Fire Brigade said Friday that the fire was believed to be \"non-suspicious\" and that its investigation will \"now focus on the electrical distribution equipment.\"",
      "\"Given the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met's Counter Terrorism Command is now leading enquiries. This is due to the specialist resources and capabilities within that command that can assist in progressing this investigation at pace to minimize disruption and identify the cause,\" the police said in a statement.",
      "Tracking services showed flights being diverted to London's Gatwick Airport, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and Ireland's Shannon Airport. British Airways\u00a0had earlier said the closure would have a significant impact on its operations and customers, adding that it was working as quickly as possible to update travelers on their options for the \"next 24 hours and beyond.\"",
      "The FlightRadar24 live tracking website showed at least 1,350 flights into and out of Heathrow were affected. According to the online service, the top route to and from Heathrow is the connection with New York's JFK International Airport, with 146 flights every week.",
      "\"I saw the time on the screen started to increase,\" passenger Tori Dunzello, who had been on a flight to the U.K. to attend her father's funeral, told CBS News partner network\u00a0BBC News. \"I turned on my world map, and I started seeing a big U-turn, and I turned around and said to my husband: 'I think we're turning around.'\"",
      "Dunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.",
      "The impact of the Heathrow power outage was likely to last several days, leaving thousands of passengers forced to find alternate travel plans.",
      "\"We're talking about several days' worth of disruption to get the planes recovered and start using them again to move planned and disrupted passengers,\" Aviation consultant John Strickland told The Associated Press, comparing the outage to \"a contained version of 9/11 or, to an extent, the Icelandic volcanic eruption\" in 2010 that shut down European airspace.",
      "\"Heathrow being such a busy airport and full, there's no kind of wriggle room for getting out of these kind of things,\" Strickland told the AP.",
      "Britain's National Rail service canceled services to and from Heathrow for the day, though some passengers could still be seen attempting to enter the airport on foot on Friday. They were turned away by police.",
      "The London Fire Brigade said 10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at a substation near the airport in the west London town of Hayes. It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was \"under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day.\"",
      "The power outage affected \"a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a\u00a0statement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated.",
      "Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a social media post that the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes, but by Friday afternoon, the National Grid power distributor said the network had \"been reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to\" the substation in Hayes.",
      "\"This is an interim solution while we carry out further work,\" National Grid said, adding: \"We are continuing to work closely with all stakeholders to manage this incident, and are focused on returning to normal resilience levels as soon as possible.\"",
      "Authorities said it wasn't clear what had sparked the blaze at the substation, but local residents reported hearing explosions.",
      "\"I was about 100 yards from the explosion,\" local resident Vaneca Sinclair told the BBC. She said she had been getting ready for bed in her home at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday evening (7:30 p.m. Eastern) when \"suddenly there was this huge bang and the house just shook.\"",
      "\"When the first explosion went off... I literally just ran out of the house,\" another local resident, Savita Kapur, told the BBC. She said she got her elderly mother in her car to drive her to her sister's house. \"When I was driving up my road the second explosion went off and the whole ground shook.\"",
      "\"We will have to look hard at the causes, and also the protection and the resilience that is in place for major, major institutions like Heathrow,\" U.K. energy secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC earlier Friday.",
      "The latest numbers from travel data provider OAG Aviation show Heathrow is the fifth busiest airport in the world this month. Earlier this year, it reported its busiest January on record, serving over 6.3 million passengers and averaging over 200,000 passengers a day. More than 1.2 million of those passengers traveled between the U.K. and the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Some Europeans are becoming leery of visiting the U.S., as reports of U.S. immigration authorities detaining them while traveling, for reasons that are not clear, swirl.",
      "A number of tourists from Europe say they have been stopped at U.S. border crossings and held at U.S. immigration detention facilities for weeks, despite holding tourist permits, work visas, or otherwise believing that they are authorized to travel to the U.S.",
      "A backpacker from Wales was detained at the Canadian border for close to three weeks, before being permitted to fly home. A Canadian woman with a work visa was detained for 12 days at the Tijuana border, before returning to Canada.",
      "And German tourist Lucas Sielaff, who drove to Mexico from Las Vegas, where he was visiting his American fianc\u00e9, was locked up while returning from Tijuana. Immigration authorities accused him of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said, despite being just 22 days into it. Sielaff was held for 16 days before he was permitted to fly home to Germany on his own dime.",
      "Sielaff and others who were detained said it was never made clear why they were taken into custody.",
      "\"What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol's power,\" his fianc\u00e9, Lennon Tyler, told the Associated Press.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, agreed that \"the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.\"",
      "\"The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios told the Associated Press.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on the number of tourists that have been held at detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the AP that Sielaff was deemed \"inadmissible\" by Customs and Border Protection, without providing more specifics. Generally speaking, they said that \"if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\"",
      "Consider \"delaying personal travel\" abroad",

      "Could trade war weigh on tourism to U.S.?",
      "A recent analysis shows that President Trump's trade war could also dissuade tourists from visiting the U.S. just by alienating key allies and trade partners.",
      "Data from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025.",
      "International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:35:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Under pressure from Trump and with Russia menacing, Germany's incoming leader plans to revamp the country's defense posture. Can he deliver?",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0In a landmark shift, Germany is set to embark on its most ambitious defense spending initiative since World War II. Lawmakers have embraced plans unveiled by\u00a0Friedrich Merz, soon to take the reins as Germany's new chancellor, for an enormous boost to the country's military budget, signaling a dramatic transformation in its post-World War II defense posture.",
      "On Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, approved a 1 trillion euro spending package that effectively lifts a decades-old \"debt brake\" measure in the nation's laws that has capped military spending at less than 1% of national GDP. The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.",
      "The package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.",
      "Merz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.",
      "At the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:",
      "First is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"",
      "The other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.",
      "Can Merz make good on his defense spending plans?",
      "There are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "Economic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.",
      "Christian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"",
      "But for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution \u2014 and even a clear commitment to one \u2014 could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.",
      "President Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.",
      "The planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.",
      "Germany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.",
      "The success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

The \"Argo\" star noted that while people have speculated about the issues that led to his divorce from JLo, the real reason is much more ordinary than anyone might believe. Affleck and Lopez's different approaches to fame have been mentioned as the cause of their split after the premiere of Lopez' documentary, \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told,\" but the \"Air\" director emphasized it \"wasn't the cause of some major fracture.\"",

      "\"This distinction is crucial because visceral fat, which accumulates around the abdominal organs, is more metabolically active and has been implicated in adverse health outcomes, including insulin resistance, inflammation and abnormal blood fat levels. Consequently, individuals with similar BMIs may have distinct cancer risks due to differences in fat distribution.\"",
      "Why the difference between men and women?",
      "One potential reason for the gender discrepancy, according to the researchers, is that men are more likely to store fat viscerally (in the belly), while women generally accumulate more subcutaneous fat (under the skin) and peripheral fat (in the arms and legs).",
      "ALZHEIMER\u2019S AND PARKINSON\u2019S RISK IS HIGHER FOR PEOPLE WITH BODY FAT IN TWO SPECIFIC AREAS",

      "Strength training three times per week is ideal, one doctor advised. \"Resistance training reduces visceral fat and inflammation.\" (iStock)",

      "Minimizing risk",
      "To reduce cancer risk, Osborn recommends that men measure their waistlines to ensure they're in a healthy range. People can also track their visceral fat score on a medical-grade anthropometry scale, he said.",
      "\"Understand that belly fat isn\u2019t just cosmetic \u2014 it\u2019s carcinogenic.\"",

      "Gantenerumab, a monoclonal antibody designed to target and remove amyloid plaques in the brain, was in development by Roche in Switzerland and its U.S. affiliate, Genentech.",
      "Development was stopped in 2023, however, after Roche/Genentech\u2019s own clinical trials found that the drug did not meet their \"primary endpoint\" for slowing cognitive decline in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease, according to the release.",
      "HIGHER DEMENTIA RISK SEEN IN WOMEN WITH COMMON HEALTH ISSUE",
      "\"Everyone in this study was destined to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease and some of them haven\u2019t yet,\" said Bateman in the release.",
      "\"We don\u2019t yet know how long they will remain symptom-free \u2013 maybe a few years or maybe decades. In order to give them the best opportunity to stay cognitively normal, we have continued treatment with another anti-amyloid antibody in hopes they will never develop symptoms at all,\" he went on.",
      "The hope is that if late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s trials have similar results, prevention methods could ultimately be available to the general population, according to the researchers. (iStock)",
      "\"What we do know is that it\u2019s possible to at least delay the onset of the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and give people more years of healthy life.\"",

      "\"One day soon, we may be delaying the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease for millions.\"",
      "Howard Fillit, M.D., co-founder and chief science officer at the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation in New York, noted that the study shows for the first time that early treatment to clear the plaques before symptoms arise can delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 \"similar to how we treat and prevent other chronic diseases.\"",
      "Although gantenerumab is no longer being developed, researchers are evaluating other anti-amyloid drugs \u2014 such as remternetug, which is made by Eli Lilly \u2014 to determine whether they may prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease. (iStock)",
      "\"We\u2019ve entered into a new era of Alzheimer\u2019s research where we can not only modify the course of the disease, but where prevention is possible with therapeutic intervention,\" Fillit, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Potential limitations, risks",
      "There were several main limitations to the research, Bateman told Fox News Digital.",
      "The number of people was limited due to the rarity of Alzheimer\u2019s disease caused by mutations, the use of external controls, and the fact that the study started with lower doses, he said.",
      "TWO ALZHEIMER\u2019S DRUGS HELP PATIENTS LIVE INDEPENDENTLY AT HOME FOR LONGER PERIODS",
      "\"Many of the participants are still cognitively normal and near or past their expected age of onset even after more than eight years of treatment, so the effects could be larger or smaller with continued treatment and follow-up,\" Bateman noted.",
      "The researchers said that anti-amyloid medications like gantenerumab have been shown to cause amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).",
      "Amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and can interfere with cognitive function, is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "These appear on brain scans as \"tiny spots of blood in the brain or localized swelling of the brain,\" the release stated.",
      "The majority of these side effects do not cause symptoms and resolve without treatment, but in rare cases ARIA can cause serious medical issues or can even be fatal.",
      "This most recent study showed that 30% of participants experienced ARIA, likely due to the higher doses of the drug.",
      "Although two participants had to stop using gantenerumab due to severe ARIA, there were no \"life-threatening adverse events and no deaths,\" the researchers noted.",
      "\"Overall, the safety profile of gantenerumab in the extension was similar to that in the original trial and in other clinical trials of gantenerumab,\" they stated.",
      "More research needed, experts agree",
      "Dr. Chris Vercammen, a board-certified internal medicine physician who specializes in geriatrics and palliative care, said that while these initial findings are \"encouraging,\" more research is needed on the effects of these medications.",
      "\"Large, randomized trials, including diverse populations and individuals with late-onset Alzheimer's, are needed to validate these early results and determine the full potential of these treatments,\" Vercammen, who is also medical director at Remo Health in California, told Fox News Digital.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

The iOS 18.2 update, released in December, patched the vulnerability by enforcing HTTPS for all network communications within the Passwords app, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or redirect traffic.",
      "If you\u2019re using an iPhone or iPad with the Passwords app, ensure your device is updated to iOS 18.2 or later. This ensures you\u2019re protected from this vulnerability. If you haven\u2019t updated yet and used the app on public Wi-Fi between September and December 2024, consider changing passwords for any accounts you accessed during that period, just to be safe.",

      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6) Regularly monitor all your accounts:\u00a0Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and report any unusual transactions or login attempts to Apple.",
      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

The IRS has been sending out COVID-19 stimulus payments worth up to $1,400 to around 1 million tax filers who missed them. Initially, these payments were self-claimed, but now the IRS is automatically issuing them to ensure eligible taxpayers get what they\u2019re owed.",

Payments will be deposited directly using the banking information listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or sent as a paper check.",

These fake texts claim that recipients will receive an Economic Impact Payment from the IRS and often ask for sensitive personal information, like bank account details or your Social Security number. Scammers use this information to steal your identity or financial data.",

Antivirus software can detect and block suspicious links, warn you about potentially harmful websites and prevent malware from being installed on your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always verify the authenticity of unsolicited communications:\u00a0If you receive an unexpected email, text or phone call claiming to be from a government agency, it's essential to confirm its authenticity. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to trick you into taking immediate action. To verify, always use official contact details from government websites. Avoid clicking any links in the message and reach out to the agency directly to confirm whether the communication is legitimate.",
      "3. Reach out directly if you're unsure:\u00a0When you\u2019re unsure about the legitimacy of a message or request, contact the government agency directly using verified contact details. Never respond to the message or click on any links within it. By calling or visiting the agency\u2019s official website, you can ensure you\u2019re communicating with authorized representatives and avoid scammers impersonating government officials.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts:\u00a0One of the best ways to protect your sensitive information from scammers is by using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like \"password123\" or \"qwerty.\" Instead, create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.",

      "5. Monitor your tax account: Regularly check your IRS account at\u00a0www.irs.gov to confirm the status of your tax return, verify that no unauthorized tax filings have occurred and update personal and contact information as needed.",
      "6. Report suspicious tax-related activities immediately: If you suspect a scam or fraudulent activity, it\u2019s crucial to report it to the relevant authorities right away. Whether you\u2019ve received a suspicious message or believe your information has been compromised, reporting it helps prevent further harm. The IRS and other agencies have dedicated channels for reporting fraud, so take action as soon as you can to protect yourself and others from these schemes.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: Use a personal data removal service to remove your personal information from data broker and people-finder sites, which scammers often use to find phone numbers and email addresses. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "9. Be wary of spoofed websites: Type the address of your actual tax prep site rather than clicking on a link from an email or advertisement. Investigate the domain before entering any confidential information.",
      "10. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0An identity theft protection service provides personal and financial monitoring and will try to help you if your identity is ever compromised. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader Monday while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his shocking imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Many observers said the 7-1 ruling in Han's case did not signal much about the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn\u2019t a key figure in imposing martial law. But the ruling could still embolden Yoon\u2019s staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Speaking with reporters following his reinstatement, Han thanked the court for what he called \"a wise decision\" and promised to focus on tackling \"urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive tariffs policy. He also called for national unity, saying: \"There\u2019s no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\"",

      "South Korea has been thrown into political turmoil since Yoon, a conservative, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and sent hundreds of troops to the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly and other places in Seoul. Yoon's decree lasted only six hours as enough lawmakers managed to enter an assembly hall where they quickly voted down the decree.",
      "The impeachment arguments",
      "The assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, alleging he violated the Constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities and trying to detain politicians. Yoon's impeachment made Han acting president until he was impeached in late December.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country\u2019s top two officials intensified domestic division and deepened worries about South Korea's diplomatic and economic activities.",
      "South Korean acting President Han Duck-soo speaks during a briefing at the Government Complex in Seoul, South Korea, on March 24, 2025. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, Pool)",
      "A major trigger for the opposition\u2019s push to impeach Han was his refusal to fill three vacant seats at the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench. That was a highly explosive issue because the court needed support from at least six justices to approve Yoon's impeachment and filling its empty posts could make such a decision more likely.",
      "After Han was suspended, his successor as acting president, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Han was also accused in the impeachment motion of abetting Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration and obstructing efforts to open independent investigations into Yoon\u2019s alleged rebellion in connection with his martial law decree.",
      "On Monday, seven of the Constitutional Court's eight justices ruled to overturn or dismiss Han's impeachment. They ruled that his alleged actions weren\u2019t against the law or weren\u2019t serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even meet a required quorum when it passed through the assembly. One justice upheld Han\u2019s impeachment.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party expressed regret over the court\u2019s decision to reinstate Han and urged it to dismiss Yoon quickly. Yoon\u2019s office welcomed Monday\u2019s ruling, saying it shows again the opposition\u2019s repeated uses of impeachment motions were \"reckless, malicious political offensive.\"",
      "What's next?",
      "Observers earlier had predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon\u2019s case in mid-March, but it hasn\u2019t done so, sparking varied speculation on possible reasons.",
      "\"Today\u2019s verdict will give hope to Yoon\u2019s supporters for a similar fate and hope for Yoon\u2019s opponents for his ouster,\" said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \"But it\u2019s too soon to predict the court\u2019s verdict on Yoon because the specific details of both cases and allegations are different.\"",
      "Kim said the reinstatement of Han, a career bureaucrat, will bring more stability to South Korea compared to when his powers as acting president were suspended.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon\u2019s martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "Yoon argues that his martial law introduction was a desperate attempt to bring attention to the \"wickedness\" of the Democratic Party which obstructed his agenda and filed many impeachment motions against senior officials. Yoon critics counter he likely tried to use military rule to frustrate possible special investigations into scandals involving him and his wife.",

      "Yet, King's organization isn't as hopeful. \"Since HTS toppled the Assad regime in December 2024, the environment has been precarious at best. But the bloodshed that unfolded March 6-10 in Latakia and Tartous represents a frightening escalation.

      "King's organization noted that the new interim Syrian constitution states, \"The religion of the President of the Republic is Islam,\" Article III declares, and \"Islamic jurisprudence is the principal source of legislation.\" The group says that \"this language is slightly starker than Syria\u2019s previous constitution, which cited Islamic law as simply one source among others.\"",

      "Francis began his written message by telling the faithful that the parable in this Sunday's Gospel \"tells us about the patience of God, who urges us to make our life a time of conversion.\"",
      "\"Jesus uses the image of a barren fruit tree which has not born the anticipated fruit and which nevertheless the farmer does not want to cut down. He wants to fertilize it again in that it may bear fruit in the future, and this patient farmer is the Lord who works the soil of our lives with care and waits confidently for our return to Him,\" the pope wrote. \"In this long period of my hospitalization, I've had the opportunity to experience the Lord's patience, which I also see reflected in the tireless care of the doctors and healthcare workers, as well as in the care and hopes of the relatives of the sick. This trusted patience anchored in God's unfailing love is indeed necessary in our lives, especially when facing the most difficult and painful situations.\"",
      "Doctors, who announced his planned release at a Saturday evening news conference, have said the Holy Father should refrain from meeting with big groups of people or exerting himself, but that eventually he should be able to resume all his normal activities. It was Francis' longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy and the second-longest in recent papal history.",

      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive order attempting a major overhaul of American elections, requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote.",
      "The order \u2014 which also includes an array of other changes, from mail-in ballot deadlines to election equipment \u2014 could risk disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans. Election law experts questioned whether Trump had the authority to make the changes, saying the order is all but certain to be met with legal challenges.",
      "Federal law currently requires that voters swear under penalty of perjury that they are citizens and eligible to vote when they register, and courts have prevented states from adding documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters in federal races because of such laws.",
      "Trump's order directs the Election Assistance Commission, an independent, bipartisan commission that supports election officials, to redo its voter registration form and require voters to show U.S. passports or other government ID that shows citizenship to register to vote.",
      "Roughly half of Americans had U.S. passports last year, according to the State Department, and a birth certificate is not listed as an acceptable proof of citizenship under the order. Some of the other eligible ID records Trump's executive order suggests \u2014 like REAL IDs and military identification cards \u2014 do not always show citizenship, either.",
      "The order says the actions are designed to prevent noncitizens from voting, though there is no evidence they do in significant numbers in the United States. Voting as a noncitizen is a serious crime that creates a paper trail that must be routinely reviewed by election officials.",
      "Trump has long railed against noncitizen voting as part of his unfounded election fraud claims.",

      "The Constitution gives Congress and the states power to regulate the \"times, places and manner of holding elections.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have introduced a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement bill, called the SAVE Act. It would allow voters to use their birth certificates to prove their citizenship, though election officials and advocates warn it would still disenfranchise many eligible voters who do not have ready access to these documents.",
      "The executive order makes a number of other sweeping changes, including prohibiting certain election equipment that uses QR codes. Those changes would force states to buy and install new election equipment at significant cost. The order also requires that all ballots must be received by Election Day, an attempt to override states that allow mail ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be received afterward.",
      "It also asks the Department of Government Efficiency and federal agencies to hunt through state voter rolls in pursuit of ineligible voters, which Levitt said has not been possible for Republicans seeking out voter fraud in the past."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, got an earful from Senate Democrats at his confirmation hearing Tuesday, in the wake of early actions by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to downsize the agency.",
      "Democratic senators pressed Bisignano on whether he was involved in discussions about DOGE operations regarding onboarding personnel, which he denied. They grilled him on whether he agrees with Musk\u2019s rhetorical attacks on the program, which he sidestepped. They asked him to reassure them that Trump is telling the truth when he says he doesn\u2019t want to slash benefits for seniors, and that he\u2019d protect the program if confirmed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bedlam out there in Social Security,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Finance Committee.",
      "\u201cThe urgency for today\u2019s hearing couldn\u2019t be greater. Since Donald Trump took office, Social Security has experienced the most chaos in its history,\u201d he said. \u201cMass personnel layoffs, eliminating phone service for basic help, sending seniors to overcrowded and understaffed field offices that have also been put on the chopping block for closure, political appointees poking around your most sensitive private information.\u201d",
      "Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., asked Bisignano whether he agrees with Musk\u2019s claim that Social Security is a \u201cPonzi scheme.\u201d The nominee didn\u2019t directly answer, saying twice that it\u2019s \u201ca promise to pay.\u201d",
      "Bisignano told Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., that his objective is to continue and improve Social Security. When asked if it should be privatized, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe anybody\u2019s thinking about that.\u201d",
      "Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said Trump \u201chas Elon Musk ... running rampant through Social Security, and he\u2019s laying off staff and making it much more difficult for people to get benefits.\u201d She asked if he\u2019d stand up to Musk and DOGE if they come for benefits.",
      "Bisignano promised to \u201clead the agency in the manner that this Senate Finance Committee wants me to do\u201d and said he has no thought about slashing benefits. He made clear he reports to Trump amid questions about Musk.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, largely avoided the issue of DOGE and its actions on Social Security, which have prompted concerns from a few House GOP lawmakers in swing districts, too.",
      "\u201cThe president of the United States has said very clearly that we are not going to cut Social Security benefits,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chairman of the committee. \u201cAnd no matter what folks \u2014 whether it\u2019s the media or whether it is those who want to attack the administration \u2014 want to say, the reality is that it is scare tactics.\u201d",
      "Other Democrats accused Trump of lying.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of a plot afoot here. Step one is to lie about not intending to damage Social Security and to protect Social Security benefits,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., leaned on his private sector experience to emphasize the importance of customer service, telling Bisignano it is weak at Social Security. He said he has sought to call the line and experienced unacceptably long wait times while forcing customers to listen to \u201cD-grade elevator music.\u201d",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked Bisignano whether he will make sure the staffing at the Social Security Administration is sufficient to ensure beneficiaries can effectively use the services.",
      "\u201cI will commit to have the right staffing to get the job done,\u201d Bisignano replied.",
      "\u201cTo get the job done, meaning delivering the benefits people are entitled do?\u201d Warren said, to which the nominee responded yes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to that,\u201d Warren said.",
      "While Musk has taken a dim view of federal workers, Bisignano lauded them.",
      "\u201cMy father, a 46-year Department of Treasury employee, worked in Customs Enforcement, boarding ships early in the morning, and sometimes when I come home for days, he took pride in his job, and he was awarded the Albert Gallatin award,\u201d the nominee told the committee. \u201cI view federal workers from that vantage point.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A federal judge ruled Tuesday that a Columbia University student who took part in campus protests against Israel's military offensive in Gaza cannot be detained as she fights orders for her deportation.",
      "Lawyers for Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old permanent U.S. resident, say their client was a victim of \"shocking overreach\" by the government, which is seeking to deport her because of her political views and constitutionally protected protest activities.",
      "The attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to stop the deportation and the \"pattern and practice of targeting individuals associated with protests for Palestinian rights for immigration enforcement,\" adding that Chung's detainment came around the time Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was arrested this month.",
      "\"The government\u2019s actions are an unprecedented and unjustifiable assault on First Amendment and other rights, one that cannot stand basic legal scrutiny,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald on Tuesday granted a temporary restraining order against the government preventing Chung from being detained in her immigration case, according to the court order.",
      "Buchwald said at the hearing that the government had not provided enough evidence to support its claims, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Attorney Ramzi Kassem, a member of Chung's legal team, told reporters outside the court that the ruling was \"the just and fair thing.\" He described the government's actions as \"outrageous\"",
      "\"The court did the sensible thing \u2014 it is a temporary restraining order,\" Kassem said. \"Until further order of the court, ICE will not be able to take further steps to detain her, and we will continue to fight as hard as we need to to vindicate her constitutional rights in court.\"",
      "Originally from South Korea, Chung and her family have lived in the United States since she was 7 years old. The lawsuit says immigration officials signed an administrative arrest warrant for Chung on March 8, the day Khalil was arrested. Like Khalil, she does not need a student visa because of her permanent resident status.",
      "However, unlike Khalil, Chung was not arrested or detained by immigration officials, and her lawyers are seeking to ensure it remains that way.",
      "Joshua Colangelo-Bryan of Human Rights First, one of the groups legally representing her, said Tuesday that federal officers had simply not managed to find Chung to carry out a warrant for her arrest.",
      "\"The government has been very clear that it intends to expel people who have green cards if they express ideas, particularly relating to Gaza, that it doesn\u2019t agree with,\" he said.",
      "Colangelo-Bryan said he was not aware of other students with green cards who were in that situation but added, \"I would not be remotely surprised if we find out that there are other people being targeted by the government, even though they've done nothing except voice concern about civilians being killed.\"",
      "The suit names President Donald Trump and other Cabinet members as defendants, as well as acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons and acting ICE New York Field Office Director William P. Joyce. It accused the government of using the threat of deportation as \"a tool to punish non-citizen speakers who express political views disfavored by the current administration.\"",
      "ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump, who called Khalil a \"Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\" and promised more arrests of student protesters, has yet to publicly mention Yunseo's case.",
      "Chung's legal team filed a petition for habeas corpus, which means that an authority is compelled to bring someone before a court to determine the legality of the person\u2019s detention.",
      "The lawsuit says Chung, a promising student who was valedictorian in high school and excelled at college, took part in campus protests beginning in 2023. However, Chung did not have a high-profile, public role in the pro-Palestinian movement or speak to the media.",
      "On March 5, she was arrested but not detained as she was participating in a protest at Columbia against what activists believed were unfair punishments given to student protesters. The lawsuit says Chung only received a \"desk appearance ticket\" from the New York Police Department, a citation given to many protesters, which the courts are still deciding.",
      "She also faced college disciplinary proceedings twice \u2014 once for putting up posters accusing Columbia of \"complicity in genocide.\" She was found not to have violated university policy, but the lawsuit says she has been suspended since March 7.",
      "Days later, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials signed a warrant for her arrest, and on March 9, officials appeared at her parents' house seeking her.",
      "On March 10, an assistant U.S. attorney, Perry Carbone, messaged one of Chung's attorneys to say her visa had been \"revoked.\" When Chung's attorney explained that she has a green card and doesn't require a visa, Carbone replied: \"The secretary of State has revoked that too,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "On March 13, Department of Homeland Security agents executed search warrants at two Columbia residents, including Chung's dorm, the lawsuit says. The search was an attempt to find occupancy or lease agreements and travel and immigration records, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Chung's attorney said that the secretary of state doesn't have the authority to unilaterally revoke permanent resident status and that Carbone \"could not explain the justification for the government's purported action.\"",
      "Khalil\u00a0and seven other students filed suit against Columbia to keep it from sharing private disciplinary records with a GOP-led House committee. There was a hearing on the matter in federal court Tuesday.",
      "Khalil was sent to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center after he was arrested in New York this month. The case is in a jurisdictional battle as his attorneys filed a habeas petition in New York but the Trump administration is trying to hold the proceedings in Louisiana.",
      "The administration filed new allegations Monday, claiming Khalil withheld information in his permanent residency application. The filing described Khalil's First Amendment concerns as a \"red herring,\" which his legal team pushed back against.",
      "\"These late-breaking, after-the-fact allegations, silly as they are, primarily show that the government must know the supposed 'foreign policy' grounds for Mahmoud\u2019s removal are absurd and unconstitutional,\" attorney Baher Azmy said."

      "\u201cAs a veteran herself, she listens with empathy,\u201d read her October 2024 performance review, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.\u00a0 \u201cShe is the first person our clients come into contact with.\u201d",
      "Her manager also wrote that her customer service with veterans was \"always exceptional.\"",
      "Nelson was at work Feb. 24 when she received an email informing her that she was terminated. \u201cNobody was pre-warned about any of this,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cNobody knew.\u201d",
      "A federal judge has ordered probationary employees like Nelson to be reinstated, but for many the situation remains unclear.",
      "VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz did not respond to specific questions about Nelson's status.",
      "\u201cVA is complying with the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland\u2019s March 13 temporary restraining order and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California\u2019s March 13 preliminary injunction related to probationary employees,\" he said in a statement. \"We cannot comment further due to pending litigation.\u201d",
      "VA Secretary Doug Collins has sought to reassure those who are worried about how the cuts will impact veterans directly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to accomplish this without making cuts to healthcare or benefits to veterans and VA beneficiaries,\u201d he said in a YouTube post March 5.",
      "Tripp, of the VFW, said he agrees that the VA could benefit from some streamlining. But he believes that terminating someone like Nelson will have consequences for veterans in need of help.",
      "\u201cI would be concerned with positions that are front-line positions that touch veterans every day,:\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d want to make sure that somebody\u2019s at the front door so if a veteran walked in in a crisis, they would be there to help.\u201d",

    "summary": "As measles cases rise, some parents are giving their children the measles vaccine earlier. This bonus dose can be given to kids as young as 6 months.",
    "story": [
      "More measles cases have been reported in the first three months of 2025 than in all of 2024.",
      "Most of the 420-plus cases have been centered around the West Texas outbreak, which has spilled over to neighboring New Mexico and Oklahoma. Other cases in people returning from travel abroad have been reported in a handful of states.",
      "Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection, but the first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine usually isn\u2019t given until a child is 12 to 15 months old. A second dose is given from ages 4 to 6.",
      "That schedule leaves children under 1 vulnerable. Some parents, however, are opting to give their young children a dose of the vaccine ahead of schedule.",
      "Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock \u2014 an epicenter of the current outbreak \u2014 said that parents are calling to request an early dose of the MMR vaccine.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve almost doubled the amount of vaccine we administer on a typical month,\u201d Montanez said.",
      "Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics say that, in the case of an outbreak or international travel, children as young as 6 months can get a dose of the vaccine, and children under 4 years old who have gotten one dose can get their second one earlier. All doses must be separated by at least four weeks.",
      "Dr. Shilpa Patel, a pediatrician at New Jersey Hackensack Meridian Health Medical Group Northern Valley Pediatrics, said that an early dose before 12 months is essentially a bonus dose, and doesn\u2019t take the place of either of the two standard doses.",
      "\u201cIt does not count for the total,\u201d Patel said. \u201cYou still need two doses after the age of 12 months.\u201d",
      "Montanez said that\u2019s because, \u201cat this age of development, their immune system isn\u2019t quite developed to where the vaccine would provide prolonged or lifelong immunity.\u201d",
      "\u201cTherefore, we would have to give another dose at a year and essentially a third dose at 4 to 6 years,\u201d she said.",
      "While early doses are typically recommended when traveling abroad with children, Patel said she\u2019s also starting to recommend the vaccine for kids traveling to some parts of the U.S., including Texas and Disney World in Florida. Theme parks have been the sites of measles outbreaks in the past.",
      "Don Gibson, 36, and his wife considered early vaccinations for their two sons, now ages 2 years and 4 months, as they prepared in January to travel from California to Texas for an April wedding.",
      "\u201cWe were really excited to go, and they invited our kids, too, so we were going to take the whole family, but, then, after we booked our travel, including lodging, flights, we saw the outbreak happening in Texas,\u201d Gibson said.",
      "This prompted a conversation with the family pediatrician, who said they could give an early second dose for their 2-year-old and a dose for the infant when he reached 6 months.",
      "The wedding, however, would occur before the infant hit 6 months, and ultimately the family decided to cancel their plans.",
      "Patel said that she\u2019s even started offering an early dose to families who aren\u2019t traveling, but who are concerned about rising measles counts in their neighborhood, pointing to the three measles cases recently identified in her home state, New Jersey.",
      "For now, doses for domestic travel and for patients in places without active outbreaks are being given at the discretion of individual doctors and parents.",
      "There\u2019s currently no official recommendation for people traveling domestically to places experiencing outbreaks.",
      "Some are calling for changing that to include a flexible third dose.",
      "In an article earlier this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, former CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and several other experts proposed codifying an extra dose for high-risk domestic travel.",
      "Montanez noted that it\u2019s unclear whether insurance will cover an extra dose of the MMR vaccine.",
      "She said that 80% of her patients are on Medicaid and have their regular immunizations covered by the Texas Vaccines for Children program. But, because these particular doses are given outside of the standard schedule, it remains unclear whether they will be reimbursed.",
      "Ultimately, the extra dose is the parents\u2019 choice.",
      "\u201cIf you decide you want to do this, you are welcome to,\u201d Montanez said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to do this, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved the first drug in a new class of antibiotics for treating urinary tract infections \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened in nearly 30 years.",
      "The drug, a pill called Blujepa from drugmaker GSK, was approved for women and girls 12 and up with uncomplicated UTIs \u2014 the most common type of the infection in women, often caused by bacteria including E. coli.",
      "Most UTIs are easy to treat, usually clearing up within a few days or weeks after a short course of antibiotics.",
      "But the bacteria that commonly cause them are increasingly becoming resistant to the standard antibiotics, making treatment more difficult, said Dr. Sovrin Shah, an associate professor of urology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.",
      "More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the U.S. each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2019 study found resistance to at least one drug in more than 92% of bacteria that can cause UTIs. Around 80% showed resistance to at least two.",
      "Developing new antibiotics that attack bacteria in different ways reduces the risk of drug resistance, helping to keep treatment options open, said Dr. Candace Granberg, a pediatric urologist and surgeon-in-chief at Mayo Clinic Children\u2019s in Rochester, Minnesota.",
      "UTI symptoms include a burning feeling when urinating, blood in the urine, a strong urge to urinate and urinating more often. Untreated, they can lead to complications including bladder infections and kidney damage.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need new antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs,\u201d Granberg said.",
      "Blujepa is part of a new class of antibiotics called triazaacenaphthylenes, which work by targeting two key enzymes that E. coli bacteria need to copy itself and survive.",
      "\u201cIn simple terms, this new antibiotic works its magic by using a novel binding method to block a bacteria\u2019s ability to replicate,\u201d Granberg said.",
      "According to GSK, the last time the FDA cleared a new class of antibiotics for uncomplicated UTIs was in 1996, with the approval of fosfomycin. (Last year, the agency approved the drug Pivya for UTIs, which belongs to the penicillin drug class.)",
      "In two phase 3 clinical trials of 3,000 adults and teens, Blujepa was shown to successfully treat 50% to 58% of patients\u2019 infections when taken twice a day for five days, compared to 43% to 47% in a group that received the antibiotic nitrofurantoin.",
      "More than half of women will experience at least one UTI in their lifetime, according to a 2019 report, and around 30% will experience a recurring infection.",
      "GSK is also studying whether the drug can treat gonorrhea, according to Tony Wood, the company\u2019s chief scientific officer.",
      "Blujepa is expected to be available in the second half of the year. Wood didn\u2019t disclose how much it would cost \u2014 although, as a brand-name drug, its cost is expected to be higher than other antibiotics that have been on the market for years and have generic options.",
      "Shah, of Mount Sinai Hospital, said that cost is an important consideration, noting that physicians would likely gravitate toward generics. Still, the overuse of the same antibiotics can promote drug resistance, so a new option is helpful, he added."

      "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Utah on Tuesday added new protections for the children of online content creators following the child abuse conviction of Ruby Franke, a mother of six who dispensed parenting advice to millions on YouTube before her arrest in 2023.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox signed a law under the encouragement of Franke\u2019s now ex-husband that gives adults a path to scrub from all platforms the digital content they were featured in as minors and requires parents to set aside money for kids featured in content. Kevin Franke told lawmakers in February that he wished he had never let his ex-wife post their children\u2019s lives online and use them for profit.",
      "\u201cChildren cannot give informed consent to be filmed on social media, period,\u201d he said. \u201cVlogging my family, putting my children into public social media, was wrong, and I regret it every day.\u201d",
      "The Frankes launched the now-defunct \u201c8 Passengers\u201d channel on YouTube in 2015 and began chronicling daily life as a seemingly tight-knit Mormon family in Springville, Utah. With its large nuclear families and religious lifestyles, the state is a hotbed for the lucrative family blogging industry. The reality show \u201cThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\u201d brought widespread attention to a group of Utah-based Mormon moms and TikTok creators known as \u201cMomTok\u201d who create videos about their families and faith.",
      "The content-creation industry is largely unregulated, but several states have added certain safeguards in recent years. Illinois, California and Minnesota have enacted laws protecting the earnings of young creators, and Minnesota\u2019s law includes a similar provision to Utah\u2019s that allows content featuring minors to be taken down.",
      "Son\u2019s escape from home leads to investigation",
      "The Franke children were featured prominently in videos posted up to five times a week to an audience of 2.5 million in 2010. Two years later, Ruby Franke stopped posting to the family channel and began creating parenting content with therapist Jodi Hildebrandt, who encouraged her to cut contact with Kevin Franke and move her two youngest children into Hildebrandt\u2019s southern Utah home.",
      "The women were arrested on child abuse charges after Ruby Franke\u2019s emaciated 12-year-old son Russell escaped through a window and knocked on a neighbor\u2019s door. The neighbors noticed his ankles wrapped in bloody duct tape and called 911. Officers then found 9-year-old Eve, the youngest Franke child, sitting cross-legged in a dark closet in Hildebrandt\u2019s house with her hair buzzed off.",
      "The women were each sentenced to up to 30 years in prison.",
      "In handwritten journal entries, Ruby Franke insists repeatedly that her son is possessed by the devil and describes months of daily abuse that included starving her children and forcing them to work for hours in the summer heat without protection. The boy told investigators that Hildebrandt had used rope to bind his limbs to weights on the ground and dressed his wounds with cayenne pepper and honey, according to the police report.",
      "Hoping to strike \u2018content gold\u2019",
      "In a memoir published after her mother\u2019s arrest, Shari, the eldest child, described how Ruby Franke\u2019s obsession with \u201cstriking content gold\u201d and chasing views led her to view her children as employees who needed to be disciplined, rather than children who needed to be loved. Shari wrote that her mother directed the children \u201clike a Hollywood producer\u201d and subjected them to constant video surveillance. She has called herself a \u201cvictim of family vlogging\u201d and alluded in her book to early signs of abuse from her mother, including being slapped for disobedience when the now 22-year-old was 6.",
      "Under the Utah law, online creators who make more than $150,000 a year from content featuring children will be required to set aside 15% of those earnings into a trust fund that the kids can access when they turn 18. Parents of child actors appearing in TV or film projects will also be required to place a portion of their earnings in a trust.",
      "As the Utah Legislature was considering the measure, a new Hulu documentary titled \u201cDevil in the Family: The Fall of Ruby Franke\u201d reignited interest in the case.",
      "At a hearing last month, Kevin Franke read statements in support of the bill written by two of his daughters, ages 16 and 11. He filed for divorce shortly after his wife\u2019s arrest and petitioned to regain custody of his children from the state. His lawyer, Randy Kester, did not respond to email and phone messages over the past week seeking to confirm whether Kevin Franke had regained custody in the sealed case.",
      "Eve Franke, the youngest child who police found emaciated with her head shaved, wrote in a statement to lawmakers that they had power to protect other kids from exploitation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying YouTube is a bad thing. Sometimes it brings us together,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut kids deserve to be loved, not used by the ones that are supposed to love them the most.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 A longtime, powerful former North Dakota lawmaker, who is scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday for traveling to Europe with the intent to pay for sex with minors, exploited vulnerable boys and young men for decades, a federal prosecutor said last week in court documents.",
      "The new details emerged as prosecutors outlined their reasons for the judge to impose a roughly three-year prison sentence and lifetime supervised release for former state senator Ray Holmberg, 81. He pleaded guilty last year to travel with the intent to engage in illicit sexual activity. He faces up to 30 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and lifetime supervised release.",
      "The new court documents say Holmberg used his positions as a high school guidance counselor and state lawmaker to exploit vulnerable youth and young men for decades, and cite numerous messages the prosecutor said show some of his countless arrangements to pay for sex with young men while traveling, often while on state business trips.",
      "Holmberg also manipulated a Canadian teenager, who later took his own life, into sending him sexually explicit images, and used an alias to email certain colleagues and friends about \u201chis sexual interest in adolescent-age boys, among other things,\u201d acting U.S. Attorney Jennifer Klemetsrud Puhl wrote.",
      "Holmberg has not been charged with any new crimes. He has been jailed in Minnesota since about early November awaiting sentencing.",
      "His attorney, Mark Friese, asked in a separate filing for a lighter sentence of time served plus an unspecified period of home detention, citing Holmberg\u2019s age and multiple physical ailments. Friese wrote that Holmberg had already spent nearly a year under house arrest and would have served 145 days in custody as of Wednesday\u2019s sentencing.",
      "The case mainly focuses on Holmberg traveling to Prague at least 14 times from 2011 to 2021 where he visited an alleged brothel for commercial sex with adolescent, often homeless boys, prosecutors said.",
      "In a plea agreement last year, Holmberg acknowledged that he had \u201crepeatedly traveled from Grand Forks, North Dakota, to Prague, Czech Republic with a motivating purpose of engaging in commercial sex with adolescent-age individuals under the age of 18 years.\u201d",
      "In his court filing asking for a lighter sentence, Holmberg\u2019s attorney wrote that while his client admits he violated federal law when he traveled to Prague with the intent to have commercial sex with a minor, the government failed to confirm any instance of him actually having sex for money with anyone under age 18.",
      "Records previously obtained by The Associated Press show that Holmberg made dozens of trips throughout the U.S. and to other countries since 1999. Destinations included cities in more than 30 states as well as Canada, Puerto Rico and Norway. At least one of Holmberg\u2019s trips to Prague was state-funded through a teacher exchange program, the prosecutor wrote.",
      "\u201cHolmberg\u2019s offending conduct over the course of decades ... can only be described as corruption,\u201d Klemetsrud Puhl wrote. \u201cThat is, he used his position to serve his own ends.\u201d",
      "In one example the prosecutor described, Holmberg brought a University of North Dakota student to the university president\u2019s suite for hockey games, representing \u201ca right to access some of the most influential people in the state\u201d \u2014 including the UND president, governor and congressmembers \u2014 with the expectation of him engaging in sexual activity with Holmberg, she wrote.",
      "In 2012 and 2013, Holmberg posed as a teenage boy in an online chatroom for teens who had undergone circumcision, and misled and manipulated a 16-year-old Canadian boy into sending him explicit photos, the new filing said.",
      "The full story of the relationship is unclear because the boy later took his own life in 2021, \u201cbut no doubt Holmberg\u2019s conduct contributed to his struggles,\u201d Klemetsrud Puhl said.",
      "Former U.S. Attorney Tim Purdon said the acts described in the prosecutor\u2019s filing paints a picture for the judge of Holmberg\u2019s overall character.",
      "\u201cWhat we see here is a defendant who has a decades-long track record of identifying extremely vulnerable young men, grooming them and eventually using them for sex,\u201d Purdon said.",
      "He said the filing raises the question of who in Holmberg\u2019s circle were aware of his behavior and \u201capproved of it or countenanced it by their silence.\u201d Investigators know who those people are, Purdon said.",
      "Holmberg served in the North Dakota Senate from 1976 to 2022. He resigned in the wake of The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead reporting on a number of text messages he exchanged with a man in jail in connection with child sexual abuse material.",
      "Holmberg chaired the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee for many years. He also had stints leading a panel that handles the Legislature\u2019s interim business between biennial sessions, a position that let him approve his own travel."

      "TOKYO \u2014 The Unification Church in Japan was ordered dissolved by a court Tuesday after a government request spurred by the investigation into the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.",
      "The South Korea-based church said it was considering an immediate appeal of the Tokyo District Court\u2019s revocation of its legal status, which would take away its tax-exempt privilege and require liquidation of its assets.",
      "The order followed a request by Japan\u2019s Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.",
      "In the ruling, the court said the church\u2019s problems were extensive and continuous, and that a dissolution order was necessary because it is not likely it could voluntarily reform, according to NHK television.",
      "\u201cWe believe our claims were accepted,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding that the government would continue efforts to support victims of the church.",
      "The Japanese branch of the church had criticized the request as a serious threat to religious freedom and the human rights of its followers.",
      "The church called the court order regrettable and unjust and said in a statement that the court\u2019s decision was based on \u201ca wrong legal interpretation and absolutely unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Tomihiro Tanaka, president of the church\u2019s Japanese branch, accused the government of \u201cfabricating damages.\u201d The church is \u201cnot a malicious group that should be dissolved,\u201d he told a news conference on Tuesday.",
      "The investigation into Abe\u2019s assassination revealed links over decades between the church and Japan\u2019s governing Liberal Democratic Party. The church obtained legal status as a religious organization in Japan in the 1960s during an anti-communist movement supported by Abe\u2019s grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi.",
      "The man accused of killing Abe resented the church and blamed it for his family\u2019s financial troubles.",
      "The church, which officially calls itself the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, is the first religious group subject to a revocation order based on violations of Japan\u2019s civil code. Two earlier cases involved criminal charges \u2014 the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which carried out a sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, and Myokakuji group, whose executives were convicted of fraud.",
      "To seek the church\u2019s dissolution, the Education Ministry had submitted 5,000 documents and pieces of evidence to the court, based on interviews with more than 170 people.",
      "The church tried to steer its followers\u2019 decision-making, using manipulative tactics, making them buy expensive goods and donate beyond their financial ability and causing fear and harm to them and their families, seriously deviating from the law on religious groups, officials and experts say.",
      "The Agency for Cultural Affairs said the settlements reached in or outside court exceeded 20 billion yen ($132 million) and involved more than 1,500 people.",
      "Lawyers representing those seeking damages from the church welcomed the court decision as a major first step toward redress.",
      "\u201cWe must pursue our effort to achieve redress and to prevent future problems,\u201d head lawyer Susumu Murakoshi told reporters, demanding that the church accept the dissolution order and offer an apology and compensation to all victims.",
      "The church was founded in Seoul in 1954 by the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who preached new interpretations of the Bible and conservative, family-oriented value systems.",
      "Nicknamed the \u201cMoonies,\u201d after its founder, the church developed relations with conservative world leaders including President Donald Trump, as well as his predecessors Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.",
      "The church faced accusations in the 1970s and 1980s of using devious recruitment tactics and brainwashing adherents into turning over huge portions of their salaries to Moon. In Japan, the group has faced lawsuits for offering \u201cspiritual merchandise\u201d that allegedly caused members to buy expensive art and jewelry or sell their real estate to raise donations for the church.",
      "The church has acknowledged excessive donations but says the problem has lessened since the group stepped up compliance in 2009.",
      "Experts say Japanese followers are asked to pay for sins committed by their ancestors during Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, and that the majority of the church\u2019s worldwide funding comes from Japan."

    "summary": "Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea\u2019s worst ever were ravaging the country\u2019s southern regions, killing 18 people, officials said Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea\u2019s worst ever were ravaging the country\u2019s southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.",
      "Officials also said a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain wildfires in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest-hit by the wildfires. The Korea Forest Service said rescue efforts were underway and it was presumed that the aircraft was operated by one pilot with no crew members.",
      "An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were among the structures destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 43,330 acres and injured 19 people, the government\u2019s emergency response center said.",
      "In a televised address, acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were causing worse damage than many other past wildfires.",
      "\u201cDamages are snowballing,\u201d Han said. \u201cThere are concerns that we\u2019ll have wildfire damages that we\u2019ve never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.\u201d",
      "Han said crews were struggling to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight. Han said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday to extinguish the wildfires with the help of about 130 helicopters. He said that \u201ca small amount\u201d of 5-10 millimeters of rain was expected Thursday.",
      "Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea in terms of land burned.",
      "Officials in several southeastern cities and towns had ordered residents to evacuate Tuesday as firefighters struggled to contain multiple blazes fueled by dry winds. The largest fires were in Andong, the neighboring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan, according to South Korea\u2019s Interior Ministry.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, officials had said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed the blazes to spread again. Efforts to fight the fires were partially suspended overnight as the winds strengthened.",
      "The blaze in Uiseong destroyed nearly half of more than 30 structures at Gounsa, a temple said to have been originally built in the 7th century. Among the destroyed structures were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d \u2014 a pavilion-shaped structure built on a stream in 1668 and a Joseon Dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",
      "The temple\u2019s other state-designated \u201ctreasure,\u201d a stone Buddha statue reportedly manufactured in the 8th century, was evacuated to a safe place, according to government and Buddhist officials.",
      "The Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention center in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility.",
      "The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest \u201cserious\u201d level nationwide Tuesday, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.",
      "The 18 dead include four firefighters and government workers who were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials.",
      "Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work."

      "A California woman's son is suing Trump International Hotels for alleged negligence, claiming a Trump Hotel Las Vegas door caused her to fall and later die.",
      "The wrongful death lawsuit says the woman, Diana Truschke of the San Francisco Bay Area, was in her 70s when she was struck from behind by a revolving door at the hotel that accelerated as she exited, \"violently\" ejecting her and causing her to fall and strike her face.",
      "The Las Vegas Review-Journal was first to report on the case.",
      "The fall caused unspecified but severe and permanent injuries that required ongoing and extensive treatment, the suit alleges. On Oct. 14, 2024, Truschke died \"due to complications from her injuries\" that stemmed from the hotel's alleged negligence, it said.",
      "She was 78 at the time of her death, it said.",
      "The Trump Organization, the family company led by President Donald Trump that is the corporate parent of Trump Hotels, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "The suit was filed on behalf of the woman's estate and its administrator \u2014 her son and sole heir, John Truschke \u2014 in Clark County, Nevada, civil court on March 18.",
      "It alleges the revolving door was not in compliance with laws and regulations and was in a dangerous state at the time. The hotel should have been aware it \"was not working properly,\" according to the suit.",
      "Diana Truschke was a real estate agent in San Mateo County, a coastal region just south of San Francisco.",
      "The suit said that at the time of her fall, she was a patron of Trump Hotel Las Vegas, a 64-story high-rise that opened in 2008 with lodging and condominiums at the north end of the city\u2019s famed Strip.",
      "The suit seeks damages for medical and funeral expenses, as well as damages for pain and suffering."

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 01:55:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Signal, the most secure widely available messaging app, has become a go-to resource. Its shortcomings are why its use by Pete Hegseth has rocked politics.",
    "story": [
      "Signal, the most secure widely available messaging app, has become a go-to resource for journalists, leakers and other people concerned about privacy. But it\u2019s not infallible. And its shortcomings and limitations are precisely why its use by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top Trump administration defense officials has rocked the worlds of politics and national security.",
      "The app made headlines Monday after Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg published the bombshell news that the Trump administration had accidentally added him to a Signal group chat this month to discuss military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "At first glance, it might not seem a major problem. Cybersecurity experts widely consider Signal to be the leading easy-to-use encrypted messaging service, and there are no public reports of its ever having been compromised by hackers.",
      "Signal\u2019s encryption protocol \u2014 the complicated algorithm that scrambles messages as they\u2019re sent, then descrambles them for recipients \u2014 is the basis for some of the most popular messaging apps, including WhatsApp and iMessage. In 2023, Signal began updating its encryption to address the hypothetical threat of a quantum computer that could break less complicated encryption codes.",
      "But Signal can\u2019t protect people, even Cabinet members, if they accidentally tell it to message the wrong person, said Mallory Knodel, the founder of the Social Web Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has helped social media networks in the fediverse implement encryption.",
      "\u201cSignal is as secure as it gets for end to end encrypted messaging, but this leak was because they added an untrusted party to the chat,\u201d she told NBC News over Signal.",
      "According to the Atlantic article, Goldberg was seemingly added to a Signal group chat that included sensitive national security discussions among Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Goldberg described the discussions\u2019 continuing for six days before he removed himself, all while the rest of the group appeared to be unaware that he was in the chat.",
      "Goldberg chose not to publish what appeared to be highly sensitive, classified information, including the name of a high-ranking CIA official included in the chat and some specific details about the military operation.",
      "A Signal spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Discussing sensitive military matters over smartphone group chats is far outside normal protocol, regardless of the messaging app. Military coordination is usually done over one of two government systems: a more routinely used system called the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet, for communications deemed to be secret, and one called the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, or JWICS, for top-secret ones. Both networks operate as isolated communications systems not connected to the larger internet, making them less vulnerable to hacks and attacks.",
      "Signal uses end-to-end encryption, which is designed for a specific threat: that someone, perhaps a government or law enforcement officer, might intercept a message as it travels between one person\u2019s phone to another\u2019s.",
      "End-to-end encryption scrambles information in transit so that receivers of that information can\u2019t unscramble it unless they have a specific code.",
      "The app doesn\u2019t rely on a single code to descramble information; instead, it creates a new code for every account. Even if Signal receives a court order to decrypt a user\u2019s message, it wouldn\u2019t be able to comply.",
      "When hackers who the United States says work for Chinese intelligence broke into telecommunications companies around the world last year, including the American companies AT&T and Verizon, they got access to conventional SMS text messages on some accounts. That led to the remarkable warning in December from some federal officials, including the FBI, that Americans should use encrypted messaging apps if they wanted to stay private.",
      "But that\u2019s where the usefulness of Signal \u2014 or of any encrypted messaging app \u2014 ends.",
      "Just because Signal protects messages in transit doesn\u2019t mean it protects its users from other types of snooping.\u00a0 A person who gains full access to a person\u2019s unlocked phone, either remotely with sophisticated hacking software or by physically acquiring it, can simply read a decrypted Signal message.",
      "That\u2019s the root of the concern of the commercial spyware industry, in which companies lease powerful malicious software, like Pegasus, that hacks entire phones. While companies that offer that technology often say they lease it to governments only for national security uses, researchers have long documented that authoritarian regimes use the technology to spy on activists, journalists and political opponents.",
      "While such spyware isn\u2019t widely deployed against most people, top government officials are some of the biggest targets for governments and intelligence agencies engaged in espionage.",
      "Last year, for example, a Chinese hacking campaign targeted the phones of Donald Trump, Vance and then-Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "\u201cSignal protects against outside snoops listening in on your private conversations,\u201d Riana Pfefferkorn, an encryption policy expert at Stanford University, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect against the risk of outsiders accessing the device where you\u2019re using the app. If a phone has been hacked and has spyware implanted on it, then your messages and other files on the device could be getting read without your knowledge,\u201d she said.",
      "A memo sent to Defense Department staff members last week warned about using Signal, citing a Google report last month that Russian intelligence has increasingly tried to trick Ukrainian Signal users into sharing personal information or giving the spies access to their Signal accounts.",
      "Signal offers a feature whereby users can sync their accounts with other devices, like second phones or laptops. One method that Google said Russian intelligence services have deployed is to systematically try to trick Ukrainians into syncing their Signal accounts with phones controlled by the Kremlin.",
      "The report cited no examples of Signal\u2019s being compromised."

Randy Fine in the 6th District, according to a report filed with the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday night, which was first reported by The New York Times.",

But it is a sign that Musk may be paying attention to the contests, as he continues to ramp up his political engagement while he serves as a key White House adviser. America PAC has also spent millions of dollars on next week\u2019s state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s special elections in Florida are taking place in deeply Republican territory. President Donald Trump carried the 1st District by 37 points in November and the 6th District by 30 points, according to election result calculations from the NBC News Decision Desk.",
      "Yet House Republican leaders have been sounding the alarm about the 6th District race to replace former GOP Rep. Mike Waltz, who resigned in January to become Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Fine recently filed a lackluster fundraising report, significantly trailing his Democratic opponent, Josh Weil, a public school teacher.",
      "Patronis was also outraised by his Democratic opponent in the 1st District, gun control activist Gay Valimont, but not as dramatically.\u00a0The winner of the 1st District race will replace GOP former Rep. Matt Gaetz.",

      "President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive order attempting a major overhaul of American elections, requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote.",
      "The order \u2014 which also includes an array of other changes, from mail-in ballot deadlines to election equipment \u2014 could risk disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans. Election law experts questioned whether Trump had the authority to make the changes, saying the order is all but certain to be met with legal challenges.",
      "Federal law currently requires that voters swear under penalty of perjury that they are citizens and eligible to vote when they register, and courts have prevented states from adding documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters in federal races because of such laws.",
      "Trump's order directs the Election Assistance Commission, an independent, bipartisan commission that supports election officials, to redo its voter registration form and require voters to show U.S. passports or other government ID that shows citizenship to register to vote.",
      "Roughly half of Americans had U.S. passports last year, according to the State Department, and a birth certificate is not listed as an acceptable proof of citizenship under the order. Some of the other eligible ID records Trump's executive order suggests \u2014 like REAL IDs and military identification cards \u2014 do not always show citizenship, either.",
      "The order says the actions are designed to prevent noncitizens from voting, though there is no evidence they do in significant numbers in the United States. Voting as a noncitizen is a serious crime that creates a paper trail that must be routinely reviewed by election officials.",
      "Trump has long railed against noncitizen voting as part of his unfounded election fraud claims.",

      "\u201cThe president\u2019s got almost no power over federal elections,\" said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law scholar at Loyola Law School. \u201cAs the senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the last administration, one of the things that was very clear is how little power the president has over federal elections \u2014 by design.\"",
      "The Constitution gives Congress and the states power to regulate the \"times, places and manner of holding elections.\"",
      "Republicans in Congress have introduced a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement bill, called the SAVE Act. It would allow voters to use their birth certificates to prove their citizenship, though election officials and advocates warn it would still disenfranchise many eligible voters who do not have ready access to these documents.",
      "The executive order makes a number of other sweeping changes, including prohibiting certain election equipment that uses QR codes. Those changes would force states to buy and install new election equipment at significant cost. The order also requires that all ballots must be received by Election Day, an attempt to override states that allow mail ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be received afterward.",
      "It also asks the Department of Government Efficiency and federal agencies to hunt through state voter rolls in pursuit of ineligible voters, which Levitt said has not been possible for Republicans seeking out voter fraud in the past."

      "Ben Affleck has opened up about his divorce from Jennifer Lopez for the first time.",
      "Affleck spoke about the divorce in an interview with GQ published on March 25, when he was talking about how he presents himself to the public.",
      "\"My life is actually pretty drama-free,\" Affleck said. \"And so even if I have the same events that people have \u2014 I\u2019m sure in your mind you\u2019re thinking, Oh, well, you just got divorced. That\u2019s not drama-free.",
      "\"And I understand that instinct, but all of this is pretty adult, and for all the sensational stuff that gets written, if somebody sat down and talked to me about it, and I said, 'Well, this is really the experience,' their eyes would glaze over with boredom,\" he continued.",
      "The interviewer said he was thinking about Lopez's documentary \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told,\" in which the premise was about the idea that Lopez and Affleck are private people but have public dimensions, and that Lopez was going to put more of herself and Affleck out there in the documentary.",
      "Affleck's response to the assertion was captured on camera, which the interviewer noted.",
      "\"Part of it was, 'Okay, if I\u2019m going to participate in this, I want to try to do it in an honest way and in a way that\u2019s interesting.' Because I thought it was an interesting examination,\" Affleck told GQ.",
      "\"Like I mentioned to you before, there are a lot of people who I think have handled celebrity more adeptly and more adroitly than I have, Jennifer among them,\" he continued. \"My temperament is to be a little bit more reserved and private than hers.\"",
      "Affleck said that he and his ex-wife didn't always have the same attitude toward fame.",
      "\"And so I thought, Oh, this is interesting because how do you reconcile that? Because exactly what you said is true. I love and support this person. I believe in them. They\u2019re great. I want people to see that,\" he said.",
      "Affleck referenced a line he said in the documentary: \"You don\u2019t marry a ship captain and then say, 'Well, I don\u2019t like going out in the water.'\"",
      "\"You\u2019ve got to own what you knew going into any relationship,\" he said. \"And I think it\u2019s important to say that wasn\u2019t the cause of some major fracture. It\u2019s not like you can watch that documentary and go, 'Oh, now I understand the issues that these two had.'\"",
      "Affleck and the interviewer met again a few days later, and Affleck brought up his comments about Lopez again when asked how he felt about the previous conversation.",
      "\"Well, on the one hand there\u2019s the first feeling, which is like, well, I hope I was clear about, when you asked me about Jen and the documentary and I talked about that and my sort of personal life a little bit, which I don\u2019t mind doing as long as my actual feelings and intentions and beliefs are communicated, which I hope I was clear that really this is somebody I have a lot of respect for,\" he said.",
      "\"And I get wanting to divine or explore the kind of differences in perspective that we have in terms of how a person feels comfortable approaching the line between public and private life,\" he continued. \"But I really hope that whatever you use doesn\u2019t suggest that I have any negativity or judgment or anything regarding that. I have nothing but respect.\"",
      "Affleck said there can be a tendency to look at a breakup and want to identify \"root causes.\"",
      "\"But honestly, like I said, the truth is much more quotidian than probably people would believe or would be interesting,\" he said.",
      "The interviewer asked to clarify that there wasn't one major thing that led to their breakup, which Affleck confirmed.",
      "\"Yeah, there\u2019s no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue,\" he said. \"The truth is, when you talk to somebody, 'Hey, what happened?' Well, there is no: 'This is what happened.' It\u2019s just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do.",
      "\"And as you get older, this is true for me, I assume it\u2019s true for most people, there is no 'So-and-so did this' or 'This was the big event.' It\u2019s really, it sounds more like a couple\u2019s therapy session, which \u2014 you would tune out of someone else\u2019s couple\u2019s therapy after a while,\" he added. \"For one thing, you start going, 'Okay, clearly this person has got\u00a0these\u00a0issues. Clearly they have\u00a0these\u00a0issues.' And the reason I don\u2019t want to share that is just sort of embarrassing. It feels vulnerable.\"",
      "Lopez, 55, filed for divorce from Affleck, 52, in August 2024, two years after they married. Lopez cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split, according to court documents obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Lopez addressed the divorce in an October 2024 Interview magazine piece, saying she was \u201cexcited\u201d to be single again.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking for anybody,\u201d she noted, saying that the summer of 2024 was a lesson in learning she had to be \u201cgood on (her) own.\u201d",
      "Lopez and Affleck first met and got engaged in 2002, but broke up in 2004, before reconnecting in 2021 after multiple engagements and marriages to other people. The pair finalized their divorce in January 2025."

    "story": [
      "Trisha Yearwood made sure to thank someone near and dear to her heart when she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 24.",
      "Yearwood noted early in her speech that there are \u201ca lot of Garths in my life\u201d before singling out her husband, fellow country star Garth Brooks.",
      "\u201cThe first Garth that I met is here, and the one that has really been a cheerleader and, who, as many accolades and awards as he has won, I\u00a0never see him get more excited than he does when I receive something,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for all the people that want this for me, nobody wants it more than you. And I just appreciate you for being my support.\u201d",
      "The \"Walkaway Joe\" singer then joked about where her star is in relation to Brooks\u2019.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re down a few stars from each other, but we\u2019re going to figure out something. We\u2019ll put some breadcrumbs or something,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s my person. He\u2019s the love of my life,\u201d Yearwood told \u201cExtra\u201d\u00a0at the ceremony, which also featured speeches from Carly Pearce and Reba McEntire.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s accomplished so much in his career, but he really is happiest when other people win, and I think he just believes in me so much and he believes that I deserve more than I believe I deserve. And so I genuinely believe he\u2019s the happiest person here today.\u201d",
      "Brooks previously gushed about his wife after she received the ACM Honors Icon Award during the ACM Honors last August.",
      "\u201cI was just so proud,\u201d he wrote on his website at the time. \u201cI\u2019m always proud of her, but to see and hear her recognized like that \u2014 and to hear people use the word \u2018icon\u2019 in the same breath as her name \u2014 just took me someplace new.",
      "\u201cShe\u00a0is\u00a0an icon. I know what a world-class talent and force she is\u2026and we all know what an incredible vocalist she is\u2026but I love it when others really take notice, too.\u201d",
      "Yearwood and Brooks, who married in 2005, performed together at last week's \"Opry 100,\" which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Grand Ole Opry. The couple also teamed up at the funeral for former President Jimmy Carter in January. The pair sang John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine,\u201d which they also performed at the 2023 funeral for Carter\u2019s late wife, Rosalynn Carter.",
      "Last October, Brooks was sued by a plaintiff identified as \u201cJane Roe,\u201d who alleged the \u201cFriends in Low Places\u201d singer sexually assaulted and battered his former hair and makeup artist.",
      "\u201cA lot\u2019s happened in the last two weeks. Let\u2019s address the elephant in the room, shall we?\u201d Brooks said during\u00a0\u201cInside Studio G\u201d fan chat\u00a0on TalkShopLive on Oct. 7.",
      "\u201cThis thing is on, it\u2019s going to happen, and people are telling me, it could be up to two years. OK?\u201d he continued.",
      "\u201cSo, my suggestion is, well, take a deep breath, we all just kind of settle in and let\u2019s hold hands and take the trip together, because it is something that you cannot talk about. That\u2019s all we can say about it.\u201d"

      "Dan cautions Mark that this line of work can be pretty dangerous, but Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) suggests that they might've hired Mark to be a decoy. Mark proceeds to tell them that he got the job because of his computer skills and explains that a car's computer system needs to be cleared of personal data when it's repossessed.",
      "Dan and Jackie agree to go to work with Mark and they all get nervous when they run into the owner of a car Mark is repossessing. The group sympathizes with the woman, who has a young child, and lets her keep the car.",

      "Mark is touched but frustrated since he doesn't want to be a burden to his family. He visits a classmate who says he can make him money hacking computers.

      "During the three-hour live finale, which aired Monday, March 24, Grant\u2019s parents, Renee and Robert, and sister, Taylor, met his final two: Litia Garr, a 31-year-old venture capitalist from Salt Lake City, Utah, and Juliana Pasquarosa, a 28-year-old client service associate from Newton, Massachusetts.",
      "Although both ladies impressed Grant\u2019s family, his mother seemed to favor Litia. \u201cI would be very happy with Litia. She\u2019d make a great daughter-in-law,\u201d Renee gushed in her confessional interview. But, she told her son to prioritize his happiness and to not let her opinion impact him.",
      "After getting to know Juliana, Renee was more cautious when speaking to Grant. She said she asked Juliana some tough questions and she wasn\u2019t \u201cquite there yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t tell you she loves you, I\u2019m asking you to walk away from that,\u201d Renee pleaded with her son.",

      "\u201cIn spite of my madness, you\u2019re still my son, you still love me,\u201d Robert said. \u201cI love the man that you have become.\u201d",
      "After the second family visit, Grant told Juliana he loved her. She replied, \u201cFor so long I\u2019ve debated on what it would mean to actually know that I love you. I think I\u2019m finally realizing after meeting your family it\u2019s not one particular moment.\u00a0I think I\u2019ve known that I love you, too,\u201d she added.",
      "Despite getting advice from his family, Grant remained conflicted. He had already told Litia in the penultimate episode that he was in love with her, but he expressed his strong feelings for Juliana, as well.",
      "Grant had romantic final dates in the Dominican Republic with both women, hoping it would bring him clarity. But on the day of the final rose ceremony, he awoke still unsure who to choose.",
      "\u201cFor me to not know what I\u2019m going to do is tearing me up inside. Both of these women are equally amazing and I\u2019m so close to both of them,\u201d he said in a confessional interview.",

      "Litia arrived and took a deep breath as she stepped out of the car. But, she immediately smiled when she saw Grant. She told him she was nervous before speaking. \u201cI started falling for you on Week 2 but I didn\u2019t tell you because I don\u2019t like to express it,\u201d she said. \u201cOn our one-on-one in Scotland, I knew that I loved you.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love you so much and I feel so lucky to be loved by you. You just have shown me how I want to be loved, forever,\u201d she shared.",
      "He told her he was looking for an emotional connection and he found it with her. \u201cYou are one of the most amazing, beautiful women that I\u2019ve ever met. You deserve love and you deserve to be treated right \u2026 This is hard for me.\u201d",

      "After the tearful breakup, Juliana met Grant and reflected on their journey together.",
      "\u201cGrant, not too long ago, there was a part of me that believed I may not be deserving of true love,\u201d she began. \u201cBut today, I stand in front of a man who gave me a reason to fight those beliefs.\u201d",
      "She recalled them laughing about her basketball skills on an early group date and falling for him in Scotland. Juliana said she felt like a woman deserving of his love. She promised to create a \u201csafe space\u201d for him on his tough days.",

      "He replied, \u201cThrough this whole journey, you have been someone that has inspired me. You keep me laughing with your contagious smile.\u201d",

      "Are Grant and Juliana still together?",
      "During the \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d segment of the finale, Grant and Juliana updated Palmer on what has happened since the day they got engaged. She walked out and greeted Grant with a kiss, marking their first public appearance as a couple, as the audience crowd cheered.",

      "Grant chimed in and said he chose Julianna for her \u201coutlook on life, her demeanor and her character.\u201d He said they developed a solid foundation for both a friendship and a relationship.",

      "In a March 21 Instagram video, the 43-year-old actor and comedian described having a \"really good experience\" on Mounjaro after previously not being able to \"handle\" the side effects of Wegovy, a popular weight loss drug.",
      "\u201cI wanted to share, and keep it 100 with you, that years ago \u2014 and yes, this is completely unsafe to be driving and making a video \u2014 years ago, three years ago,\u00a0I tried Wegovy\u00a0and I was like puking,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t handle it. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve changed the formula or whatever,\" she added.",
      "After her unsuccessful experience with Wegovy, the \"Kinda Pregnant\" star arranged a telehealth meeting with Midi Health, a virtual care clinic specializing in perimenopause and menopause. (Schumer later disclosed that she ended up investing in the company after the appointment.)",
      "\u201cThey put me on estrogen and progesterone because I realized I was in perimenopause and my symptoms of being in perimenopause have disappeared,\u201d she said, adding that she also has been taking Mounjaro.",
      "\"My hair is fuller, my skin is better, I have more energy. I want to 'get down' more, if you know what I mean,\u201d said Schumer, adding, \u201cI\u2019m talking about sex.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m having a really good experience, so I wanted to keep it real with you about that,\u201d said Schumer.",
      "Many have turned to telehealth sites to obtain a prescription for drugs that can help with weight loss. Anyone seeking a prescription for a weight loss drug online should first speak with a trusted health care provider.",
      "Schumer's health update comes more than a year after she described the side effects she experienced on Ozempic during a June 2023 episode of \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\"",
      "\u201cI was one of the people that felt like sick, I couldn\u2019t like play with my son,\u201d she said, noting that the drug succeeded in making her \"so skinny.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018OK this isn\u2019t livable for me,\u2019 but I immediately invested because I\u2019m like, \u2018Everyone and their mom is going to try it,\u2019\u201d she added."

In it, they discussed their relationship and the fallout from the documentary series \u201cQuiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV.\u201d",
      "In \u201cQuiet on Set,\u201d which aired on ID in April 2024, Bell came forward as the unnamed minor in the 2004 sexual abuse case against former acting and dialogue coach Brian Peck (no relation to Josh Peck).",
      "Brian Peck pleaded no contest to two charges of sexual abuse in October 2004 and was found guilty of both. He spent 16 months in prison and was made to register as a sex offender.",
      "During the first episode of the podcast, released March 24, Bell situated the abuse case within his relationship with Josh Peck and his larger Nickelodeon career.",
      "Bell said he told his mom about Brian Peck\u2019s abuse, kicking off the investigation, between the end of \u201cThe Amanda Show\u201d in 2002 and the premiere of \u201cDrake & Josh\u201d in 2004.",
      "The pending investigation with Brian Peck impacted Bell\u2019s ability to be present on the set of \u201cDrake & Josh,\u201d he said. In the show, Bell and Josh Peck play stepbrothers and polar opposites.",
      "\u201cThe whole time I\u2019m working with doing the pilot I know that there\u2019s an investigation happening. I know that this guy\u2019s (Brian Peck) about to get arrested. I know that s\u2013t is about to hit the fan, and nobody in here knows it,\u201d Bell said.",
      "Meanwhile, Josh Peck said he perceived Bell\u2019s behavior as distance \u2014 that is, until he saw the recent documentary.",
      "\u201cI was just looking at it through the prism of a 14-year-old\u2019s brain like, \u2018He doesn\u2019t want much to do with me,\u2019\u201d Josh Peck explained. \u201cIn watching the documentary at 38, as a father, as a grown-up, so much was revealed to me of what you had to go through. I can\u2019t even imagine that.\u201d",
      "Bell, at the time, was afraid the investigation would go public and impact \u201cDrake & Josh.\u201d While filming, Bell said he lost his hair and got scabs on his head, which Bell\u2019s doctor attributed to stress.",
      "\u201cIt was ever present,\u201d Bell told Peck about the investigations when filming \u201cThe Amanda Show.\u201d",
      "Bell also discussed his worries about how the investigations would affect \u201cDrake & Josh.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing the thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to do, and I\u2019ve got my partner to do it with,\u201d Bell disclosed. \u201cWhen this drops, is Josh (Peck) going to look at me like, \u2018Bro, you took our dream away.\u2019\u201d",
      "Despite his fears, Bell\u2019s identity wasn\u2019t revealed until he came forward in 2024.",
      "\u201cDrake & Josh\u201d ended in 2007. The two co-stars made public reunions, like at Nickelodeon events and in Josh Peck\u2019s show \u201cGrandfathered.\u201d",
      "They had a fallout in 2017, however, when Josh Peck did not invite Bell to his wedding, and Bell fired off a series of since-deleted tweets. According to E! News at the time, Bell wrote, \u201cWhen you\u2019re not invited to the wedding the message is clear.\u201d",
      "Josh Peck said in a 2022 \u201cBFFs\u201c podcast episode that he didn\u2019t invite Bell to his wedding \u201cbecause I hadn\u2019t really talked to him in many, many years.\u201d",
      "\u201cCut to: I\u2019m getting married that night and I see these text messages from him cursing me out, coming for me on the night of my wedding. And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yo.\u2019 And it\u2019s delusional because I\u2019m like, \u2018Bro, we worked at Coffee Bean when we were 16. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m 31 now. I might\u2019ve lost your number,\u2019\u201d he continued.",
      "At the time, Josh Peck made it seem like he and Bell were not on good terms.",
      "\u201c\u2018Drake & Josh\u2019 is something I\u2019ll be synonymous with forever and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want to like the guy that my name is attached to forever, but unfortunately, it just sort of worked out the way that it did.\u201d",
      "He also asked Bell to apologize to his wife at the MTV Video Music Awards after the wedding.",
      "Bell reacted to Josh Peck\u2019s comments in an interview with \u201cHollywood Raw\u201d in 2023, saying that he \u201cnever texted him, cursing him out the night of his wedding because I didn\u2019t know that there was a wedding until he posted about it the next day.\u201d",
      "The two don\u2019t address the wedding in the first part of the podcast. However, they speak about \u201cDrake & Josh\u2019s\u201d legacy.",
      "Bell said when supporters say they\u2019ll never watch\u00a0\u201cDrake & Josh\u201d again, he tells them to do otherwise.",
      "\u201cThat was actually where I was comfortable and happy and stoked, and I\u2019m very proud of what we did,\u201d Bell said to Josh Peck while tearing up.",
      "\u201cIt was very special and you can\u2019t recreate it,\u201d Josh Peck replied.",
      "The second part of the conversation drops March 27."

      "The contestant, named Lola, appeared with her dad, Rob, who was holding a guitar, prompting judge Carrie Underwood to guess Lola came \u201cfrom a musical family.\u201d",
      "After Underwood asked what song she would be singing, Lola said she had to bring in some family members to help her out. A few moments later, Lola came back in with her mom, Carnie Wilson, and her aunt, Wendy Wilson. Both women, of course, are the daughters of Beach Boys legend Brian Wilson and were in Wilson Phillips, along with Chynna Phillips.",

      "\u201cYou might know this song,\u201d Carnie Wilson joked beforehand.",
      "After they wrapped up, Carnie and Wendy Wilson both said they love singing as a family, but \u201clove Lola by herself even more,\u201d which prompted Underwood to say she would like to hear Lola sing by herself.",
      "Her family then walked off to the side, setting the stage for Lola, 19, to audition on her own by covering Kacey Musgraves\u2019 \u201cRainbow.\u201d",
      "Lola certainly didn\u2019t need any family to help make an impression, either.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got everything you need,\u201d Richie said after she finished, while encouraging her to sing some notes longer.",
      "\u201cThe tone and the pureness and the quality of your voice, that\u2019s a perfect song for you. But this competition is going to require you to belt, too, and kind of let loose a little bit, fill up the room a little more and using your dynamics. But you got a really, really beautiful voice,\u201d Bryan said.",
      "\u201cYou have an honesty in your voice and in your presence. I want to see you own your talent and everything that you have to offer, because you have a lot to offer. And it makes me really excited to get to potentially bear witness to that,\u201d Underwood said.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m on the show, I will push myself. That\u2019s why I want to be on \u2018American Idol.\u2019 I want to grow,\u201d Lola said.",
      "The three judges didn\u2019t need much convincing \u2014 they all voted yes, sending Lola to Hollywood for the next round.",
      "This marks the second time this season a pop star has joined a child for an \"American Idol\" audition. Earlier this month, Backstreet Boys star Brian Littrell teamed up with his son, Baylee, who also made it to the next round.",
      "Time will tell how far Lola makes it in the competition, but mom Carnie Wilson was delighted that she wanted to try out because she's growing as an artist.",
      "\"She's got something so honest and pure and lovely,\" she told \"Entertainment Tonight.\"",
      "\"I could not be more excited for her,\" she added.",
      "For those keeping score, \"Hold On\" was one of Wilson Phillips' biggest hits. It spent one week atop the Billboard Hot 100, joining \"Release Me\" and \"You're in Love\" as tracks that went to No. 1 on the chart for the group."

I looked at them as my mum and dad. It made me think I was all on my own and I was just isolated from all my parents. So I don\u2019t really think of it as\u00a0being\u00a0Jamie.

      "Cooper's first day on set was filming Episode 3, a conversation between Jamie and therapist Briony Ariston (Erin Doherty).",
      "The scene took 11 takes and resulted in a harrowing performance from Cooper. In the scene, Jamie appears to unmask himself and show how he might be capable of taking someone's life. Doherty called the performance \"genuinely scary.\"",

To think about that kid versus the one that turned up in that 11th take, and push those buttons and pushed himself, I\u2019m just so proud.\"",

      "This was just an exercise, intended to keep the crew of the Hinn\u00f8y sharp as they focused on their real mission: confronting a quiet and stealthy form of Russian aggression.",
      "Even as Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin negotiate the fate of the war in Ukraine \u2014 and express hope for better relations between Washington and Moscow \u2014 America\u2019s NATO allies say there has been no letup in Russian sabotage operations across Europe.",
      "One of the Kremlin\u2019s newest threats, according to NATO, is targeting undersea cables carrying vast quantities of data and power beneath the Baltic Sea to countries in northern Europe.",
      "Defending the cables \u2014 some of which are no thicker than garden hoses \u2014 is the task of a NATO naval patrol known as Baltic Sentry, which started in January. NBC News joined the flotilla last week as it sailed the icy sea off Poland, playing cat-and-mouse with suspected Russian saboteurs.",
      "It\u2019s a game in which the rules are murky and the geopolitical stakes are high.",
      "\u201cWe are the safety cameras of the Baltic Sea region, and anything that is undertaken unlawfully against critical underwater infrastructure will be seen,\u201d said Cmdr. Erik Kockx, a Belgian naval officer leading the task force.",
      "As he spoke, crew members of the Dutch ship HNLMS Luymes were scanning the horizon with binoculars while computer screens displayed sonar imagery of the cables hundreds of feet below alongside wrecks from World War II.",
      "NATO has accused Russia of waging \u201chybrid warfare\u201d on both land and sea \u2014 covert acts of sabotage big enough to damage European economies but small enough to avoid triggering a Western military response. \u201cIt is really state-sponsored sabotage, and in some cases even state-sponsored terrorism,\u201d Mark Rutte, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said at a summit last month.",
      "In the Baltic, analysts say, the threat is not from clearly flagged Russian military vessels but from the \u201cshadow fleet,\u201d merchant vessels that are secretly acting on orders of the Kremlin.",
      "One suspected member of the shadow fleet, according to Finland\u2019s government, is the Eagle S, an aging oil tanker that set sail near St. Petersburg on Christmas Day on a lumbering course through the Baltic.",
      "By 1 p.m. (7 a.m. ET) the ship had crossed over the Estlink-2 power cable connecting Finland to Estonia, according to tracking data provided by MarineTraffic, a maritime analytics firm.",
      "Shortly afterward, authorities detected damage to the Estlink, along with three other cables on the Eagle S\u2019s route.",
      "When Finnish commandos boarded the tanker from a helicopter, they discovered an immediate cause for suspicion: The ship\u2019s anchor was missing. Investigators said they believed it broke off as it was dragged along the seabed \u2014 slicing through cables as it went.",
      "The Kremlin had denied any involvement in the Eagle S incident or several other recent cases of damage to undersea infrastructure. Finnish prosecutors have barred three members of the ship\u2019s crew from leaving the country as they weigh bringing criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThe events in the Baltic Sea are connected to and must be viewed within the same prism of that escalating sabotage campaign by Russia across Europe,\u201d Matthew Mooney, director of the threat research division at the U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said in an interview.",
      "Lt. Cmdr. Sjoerd Knoop, captain of the Luymes, said dragging an anchor along the seabed was an obvious sign of suspicion as the crew searched for saboteurs. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal behavior,\u201d he said. Other possible warning signs include sudden changes of speed by the ships in the area around the undersea cables.",
      "Since the launch of Baltic Sentry in mid-January, there have been no clear examples of sabotage. It\u2019s not clear what exactly the warships would do if they did come across an attack. NATO has no law enforcement powers and would most likely have to rely on authorities in its member states to carry out arrests and prosecutions once the suspect ship passed through their territorial waters.",
      "\u201cNATO is here in the first place to deconflict and to deter, and we hope with our mere presence anybody who would think about inflicting damage to critical underwater infrastructure will think twice,\u201d Kockx said."

      "This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.",
      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0 roots in the Soviet era, when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.",
      "As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.",
      "\u201cLike most politics, this is mostly posturing.\u201d"

      "The order followed a request by Japan\u2019s Education Ministry in 2023 to dissolve the influential sect, citing manipulative fundraising and recruitment tactics that sowed fear among followers and harmed their families.",
      "In the ruling, the court said the church\u2019s problems were extensive and continuous, and that a dissolution order was necessary because it is not likely it could voluntarily reform, according to NHK television.",
      "\u201cWe believe our claims were accepted,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding that the government would continue efforts to support victims of the church.",

      "The church tried to steer its followers\u2019 decision-making, using manipulative tactics, making them buy expensive goods and donate beyond their financial ability and causing fear and harm to them and their families, seriously deviating from the law on religious groups, officials and experts say.",
      "The Agency for Cultural Affairs said the settlements reached in or outside court exceeded 20 billion yen ($132 million) and involved more than 1,500 people.",

      "In an exchange with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Gabbard said she did not remember discussion of specific weapons, targets or timing.",
      "The intelligence officials both testified Tuesday that Hegseth was the \u201coriginal classifying authority\u201d on the chat.

      "The hearing frequently grew heated. Democrats asked aggressive questions and accused the witnesses of jeopardizing national security.",
      "Wyden said he believes Hegseth and Waltz should resign. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said it was \u201cmind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody even bothered to check\u201d whether a journalist or another unauthorized person was in the chat.",
      "In his opening statement, Warner had blasted the Trump administration for what he characterized as a \u201ccavalier attitude towards classified information,\u201d describing it as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201csloppy.\u201d",

      "He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve been to the Court of Arbitration on our DSD (differences in sex development) regulations. They have been upheld, and they have again been upheld after appeal. So we will doggedly protect the female category, and we\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to do it.\u201d"

      "Her trademark is the triple Axel. She\u2019s the only woman in the world championships field who has successfully landed the jump this year.",
      "\u201cIt has been a whirlwind of a season,\u201d she said after the Grand Prix Final in France. \u201cI kind of struggled with this imposter syndrome. I\u2019m just happy my hard work is finally showing.\u201d",
      "All three U.S. women at worlds are capable of making the podium. Glenn is joined by 2024 silver medalist Isabeau Levito, who missed three months this season due to a foot injury, and 2022 bronze medalist Alysa Liu, who ended a two-year retirement to compete this season.",

      "Back in 2011, an 18-year-old Chock went looking for a new ice dance partner after her previous partner retired. She spoke to and tried out with several men before ultimately choosing Bates, a 2010 Olympian whose own partnership had just ended.",
      "\u201cLooking back on it, I can\u2019t believe she picked me to skate together,\u201d Bates said in 2023. \u201cI\u2019m sure I would have kept skating (if Chock chose somebody else) because I loved it, but it worked out this way, gratefully.\u201d",
      "Chock and Bates have since made three Olympic teams together, won a record-tying six U.S. ice dance titles and five world championships medals, including gold at the last two.",
      "After getting married last June, these could be the last worlds for Chock and Bates. They\u2019re trying to become the first ice dancers to win three consecutive world titles in 28 years.",
      "Next year, they hope to earn their first Olympic medals of any color in the dance competition, having already won gold in the team event.",
      "What happens in Boston will determine whether they go into the Olympic season as the outright favorites or one of several medal contenders.",
      "This season, Chock and Bates won the biggest event so far \u2014 December\u2019s Grand Prix Final \u2014 but also were defeated at other events by top couples from Canada and Great Britain.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to treat it like it\u2019s our last shot,\u201d Bates said of the next 11 months. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for a really long time, both in our 30s. We\u2019re a married couple. There are things in our lives that we would love to also accomplish, like grow a family and things like that.\u201d"

      "Authorities in Belize are taking a closer look at the possibility that carbon monoxide poisoning may have played a role in the deaths of three Americans last month.",
      "As the families of the dead released a statement Monday seeking answers one month since their bodies were discovered in their hotel room, the country's top police official said the resort has temporarily ceased operation.",
      "\"It was agreed a second round of testing be done at the hotel,\" Police Commissioner Chester Williams said last week at an impromptu news conference captured on video by television station 7 News Belize.",
      "He said previous guests came forward to report they suspected carbon monoxide levels were notable during their own visits to Royal Kahal Beach Resort.",
      "\"While they were here, they had done some carbon monoxide testing and they had detected some carbon monoxide,\" Williams said.",
      "Carbon monoxide is produced in the combustion process of gas-engine vehicles, gas- and oil-burning furnaces, generators and charcoal grills. Unscented, it stealthily kills hundreds every year in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The three women, identified as Wafae El Arar, 26; Imane Mallah, 24; and Kaoutar Naqqad, 23, were found dead in their hotel room Feb. 22 after two days of unsuccessful door knocks prompted hotel staff members to go inside, Williams has said.",
      "The women\u2019s families said in Monday\u2019s statement, provided by their spokesperson: \"We are deeply alarmed by news reports which suggest that carbon monoxide levels in the hotel could have been at dangerously high levels and that the resort has now suddenly closed without public explanation. We believe the families of all guests \u2014 past and future \u2014 deserve a clear explanation for this action.\"",
      "Williams initially said that alcohol and \"gummies\" were found in the room and that each body was discovered next to vomit. He didn't specify the type of gummies; the confection is popular as a concentrated cannabis product in states where it's legal. Researchers have noted very few overdose deaths from marijuana.",
      "On Monday, the families said in their statement that they believe the deaths are \"suspicious\" and want authorities on the case to find the \"full truth.\"",
      "It wasn't clear whether the hotel, the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in San Pedro, has reopened.",
      "Belize Tourism Minister Anthony Mahler told Channel 5 Belize that the hotel shut down voluntarily and was implementing \"remedial actions.\"",
      "The resort could reopen with permission from government authorities, he said.",
      "The general manager of the Royal Kahal, police and other Belize officials didn't respond to requests for comment Monday night.",
      "Bert Nowak, the resort's general manager, said in an interview last month that the women were in their second day of a weeklong stay and expressed condolences to their families.",
      "After Williams, the police commissioner, initially said the Belize National Forensic Science Service would determine the cause and manner of death in the case, the bodies were transferred to the women's home state, Massachusetts.",
      "A spokesperson for the Massachusetts chief medical examiner\u2019s office said by email Monday that cause and manner of death were pending and could take more than two more months to determine."
