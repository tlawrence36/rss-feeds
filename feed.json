      "He collaborated with John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, and many others",
      "NEW YORK -- Jack DeJohnette, a celebrated jazz drummer who worked with Miles Davis on his landmark 1970 fusion album and collaborated with Keith Jarrett and many other greats of the genre, has died at 83.",
      "The acclaimed drummer died Sunday in Kingston, New York, of congestive heart failure, surrounded by his wife, family and close friends, his assistant, Joan Clancy, told The Associated Press.",
      "A winner of two Grammy awards, the Chicago-born DeJohnette began his musical life as a classical pianist, starting training at age 4, before taking up the drums with his high school band. He was in demand in his early years as both a pianist and a drummer.",
      "He achieved international recognition in the 1960s through his involvement with the Charles Lloyd Quartet. Over the years he collaborated not only with Davis and Jarrett but also with John Coltrane, Sun Ra, Thelonious Monk, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Eddie Harris, Herbie Hancock, Betty Carter and many others, according to biographical material provided by representatives.",
      "In 1968, DeJohnette joined Davis and his group to work on music leading up to Davis' 1970 studio album, \u201cBitches Brew.\u201d",
      "In a Sessions Panel interview, DeJohnette spoke of how he he'd been freelancing in New York when he had an opportunity to join Davis in the studio, at a time when experimentation with genres had become \u201cthe new frontier, so to speak.\u201d",

      "\u201cDays and days and days of this would go on,\u201d DeJohnette added. \u201cWe never thought about how important these records would be, it was just we knew it was important because Miles was there and he was moving forward with something different.\u201d",
      "Rolling Stone, which listed DeJohnette as one of the top 100 drummers of all time (at No. 40), cited the drummer\u2019s \u201cown innate knack for turning a memorable tune.\u201d",
      "DeJohnette recorded on various labels but mostly on ECM. In addition to his own many projects and bands, he was a member for more than 25 years of a trio with Jarrett and Gary Peacock.",
      "His two Grammys were for new age album (\u201cPeace Time\u201d) in 2009 and for jazz instrumental album (\u201cSkyline\u201d) in 2022.",

      "More than 100 investigators are racing to solve a daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris",
      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "Additional arrests may follow as the investigation continues.",
      "The more than 100 investigators that Beccuau said are assigned to the case are combing through 150 DNA samples, surveillance footage and evidence left behind in the thieves\u2019 wake.",
      "Those assigned include the Brigade for the Repression of Banditry, the special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts.",
      "Recovering the jewels could be among the most difficult parts of investigators' work. French authorities have added the jewels to Interpol\u2019s Stolen Works of Art Database, a global repository of about 57,000 missing cultural items.",
      "Interpol, the world\u2019s largest international police network, does not issue arrest warrants. But if authorities worry a suspect may flee, Interpol can circulate the information using a color-coded notice system.",
      "The French investigators can also work with European authorities if required. They can turn to the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, or its law enforcement agency, Europol. Eurojust works through judicial cooperation between prosecutors and magistrates, while Europol works with police agencies.",
      "Both can help facilitate investigations and arrests throughout the 27-member bloc. Requests for help must come from the national authorities, and neither organization can initiate an investigation.",
      "Beccuau said more details would be released once the suspects' time in custody expires. How long that lasts depends on what they\u2019re accused of. If, as French media have reported, they\u2019re being investigated for criminal conspiracy, they can be held for up to 96 hours before charges are filed.",
      "But don\u2019t expect a flood of updates. Indictments and verdicts are not routinely made public in France. French trials are not televised, and journalists are not allowed to film or photograph anything inside the courtroom during a trial.",

      "This draw, which runs through 11 a.m. Eastern Friday, includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Fans from those countries, whose entries are selected out of this draw, will have the opportunity to buy single-match tickets for games taking place inside their home nation.",
      "The phase is open to all fans, regardless of which country they live.",
      "\u201cWe already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,\u201d said Heimo Schirgi, the tournament\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cThis second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.\u201d",
      "Those fans from the U.S, Canada and Mexico who enter the draw before it closes Friday have a chance to receive, through what FIFA says is a randomized process, a time slot during which they can buy tickets starting on Nov. 12. Those slots will be issued through Nov. 15. Fans who win those chances will receive word at least 48 hours before their time slot opens.",
      "Residents of the three host countries \u2014 the U.S., Canada and Mexico, in that order \u2014 purchased more tickets than those from any other nation in the initial phase of ticketing. England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in that order, rounded out the top 10.",
      "Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a purchasing slot starting on Nov. 17. Additional tickets will be made available in subsequent phases, FIFA said.",
      "FIFA announced earlier this month that more than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year\u2019s World Cup, with people from 212 different countries and territories having already purchased. So far, 28 of the 48 spots for teams in the field have been filled.",

An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina \u2014 featuring Lionel Messi \u2014 and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown.",

Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. The opening match for the U.S., to be played at Inglewood, California, had prices ranging from $560 to $2,735 when sales opened. On the resale site, at least one ticket for that opening U.S. match on June 12 was listed for more than $60,000 earlier this month.",
      "Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums.

      "June Lockhart, beloved for her roles in \u201cLassie\u201d and \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died at 100",
      "LOS ANGELES -- June Lockhart, who became a mother figure for a generation of television viewers whether at home in \u201cLassie\u201d or up in the stratosphere in \u201cLost In Space,\u201d has died. She was 100.",
      "Lockhart died Thursday of natural causes at her home in Santa Monica, family spokesman Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, said Saturday.",
      "\u201cShe was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.\u201d",
      "The daughter of prolific character actor Gene Lockhart, Lockhart was cast frequently in ingenue roles as a young film actor. Television made her a star.",
      "From 1958 to 1964, she portrayed Ruth Martin, who raised the orphaned Timmy (Jon Provost), in the popular CBS series \u201cLassie.\u201d From 1965 to 1968, she traveled aboard the spaceship Jupiter II as mother to the Robinson family in the campy CBS adventure \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",
      "Her portrayals of warm, compassionate mothers endeared her to young viewers, and decades later baby boomers flocked to nostalgia conventions to meet Lockhart and buy her autographed photos.",
      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

Always a political animal, he didn't shy away from criticizing the left and its illusions, especially on his 1989 album \u201cThe Haircut,\u201d whose sleeve showed him beardless with long locks. A few of his songs drew the enmity of some of his longtime admirers. The beard grew back but his politics remained moderate.",

      "LONDON -- Bon Jovi will embark on their first tour in four years in 2026 \u2014 and it's more than just a victory lap.",
      "In 2022, singer Jon Bon Jovi saw a doctor who said one of his vocal cords was atrophying. He had major surgery and has been in extensive rehab since. These new shows \u2014 kicking off with four nights at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden in July before heading to Edinburgh, Scotland; Dublin and London \u2014 are the result of all the work.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press at Wembley Stadium, where Bon Jovi will close their \u201cForever\u201d Tour in September 2026, frontman Jon Bon Jovi discusses the forthcoming gigs, his band and their latest collaborative album, \u201cForever (Legendary Edition).\u201d",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "BON JOVI: It\u2019s a lot of hits that you know. But I think more than ever, I\u2019m really in touch with the idea of gratitude and joy, and this idea of this energy that happens between me and that audience. And it\u2019s been so long since I've done it that I can really re-appreciate how much that means to me. And that\u2019s really the only motivation for me to want to do it anymore. It\u2019s just to go out there and say, \u201cTouch.\u201d You know? It\u2019s gonna be good.",
      "BON JOVI: I agree with you. I agree. You know, that optimism and tribalism but with joy as the underlying thing, you know, that fact that brings you together.",
      "BON JOVI: Well, it\u2019s home. I get to sleep in my own bed at night, which was integral to this equation, that I would play a bunch of nights there to start it as long as I was going home at night. And then we\u2019ll go and do these ( U.K. and Ireland shows) and that\u2019s going to be it. That\u2019s it for the year. Just get my feet back in the pool, you know, and get in there slowly, wait around, and after I have that joy and good health then we could talk about doing some work. But this should be about, don\u2019t even bring a suitcase. We\u2019re just going out for the weekend.",
      "BON JOVI: Really, really good. I could go tonight. I can tell that I woke up this morning at 7 a.m. and you\u2019re ready to talk and you go, \u201cYeah, it just works.\u201d",

We are going to go and do solo projects.

      "BON JOVI: It\u2019s amazing, and each of 'em\u2019s contribution has been unique. And from the newest member, Everett Bradley to Phil X, who\u2019s just that guy that wants to play seven nights a week, doesn\u2019t care where he plays, the guy\u2019s nuts. He truly would play seven days a week if he could. And to see him just going, \u201cI\u2019m here, I am here, I\u2019m not going anywhere else,\u201d it\u2019s unbelievable.",
      "BON JOVI: Well, the thing about the \u201cForever\u201d album is that we were very proud of it, and it was coinciding with the documentary and the 40th anniversary. When I wasn\u2019t up to it physically, I thought we could reimagine the record by having features on it. In this day and age, people know what features are. I learned about that the hard way. But in doing so, I think they took a great record and made it better. And, you know, I called Robbie Williams. He was the first call I made. He said yes, which made it easier for me to call number two, three, four, seven, eight, nine, 10. Because at first, it\u2019s daunting. You call even your dear friends and go, \u201cHey, would you do this for me?\u201d Each one of them did it. I think that joy in the record is felt and even just raised the level of the bar.",
      "BON JOVI: Oh, it\u2019s fantastic. I mean, I\u2019ve looked up to him my whole life. The E Street Band are our Beatles. They were just 25 miles away from where I was as a kid. You know, Highway 9 was out my window. You know, these are, these are my streets, too. And so, it was fabulous because he loved that song (\u201cHollow Man.\u201d) Even when it was a demo, he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s a really special song.\u201d So, when I called him on that one instead of the obvious single, he was like, \u201cYou know, yeah, I get it, I can do that.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Samara Joy\u2019s voice has the ability to transform listeners to the early jazz clubs, filling them with warm nostalgia for legends like Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "At 25, Joy is a five-time Grammy winning recording artist, whose album, \u201cLinger Awhile\u201d won her best new artist and best jazz vocal album in 2023. She\u2019s been praised by artists like Chaka Khan, Regina King and Quincy Jones and has amassed a large following of her Gen-Z peers on TikTok, introducing a new generation to jazz.",
      "Last year, Joy released \u201cPortrait,\u201d her third and most personal studio album allowing listeners into the tension between excitement and feeling overwhelmed that often follows a whirlwind of accolades and success. Her first original song \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d fully captures this moment.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a time where I was really questioning whether I could continue or not because I was so exhausted,\u201d said Joy. \u201cI reminded myself through that Sun Ra composition that I have experienced something wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t have to be the end all be all. This is just the beginning \u2026 this is just a springboard for all of the other creative ideas that I have and what I feel like I have to offer.\u201d",
      "For Joy, releasing \u201cPortrait\u201d was a creative challenge and a turning point toward trusting her creative instincts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about what I can do and to stand firm in the creative vision and the direction that I see for myself,\u201d she said.",

      "This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "JOY: This album was a turning point. Because I feel like it was the first time I really had to make a decision about what my path was going to be. With the first two albums, it was just songs that I loved and felt like I could interpret as my own. And this album, \u201cPortrait,\u201d was the first time I felt like I took the reins of creative direction and band mates and songs. And honestly kind of opened up even more to my band mates and said, arrange. I want you guys to orchestrate this next era.",

And I think this album taught me the importance of patience and not rushing to stay relevant or spark up a moment or just stay in that moment. It taught me to just take my time and really wait until you have something you feel like you have to say.",
      "JOY: I never expected to be nominated. I never thought that that was a possibility, at least so early on in my career.",

      "JOY: A couple years ago I did the Hollywood Bowl and it was a birthday celebration for Quincy Jones \u2014 Patty Austin, I got the chance to sing alongside of her. And backstage, you know, she was funny and sharp and quick, but she was just very supportive and very honest. And that meant a lot to me from somebody who has been in the industry for as long as she has and collaborated with Quincy Jones and George Benson and James Ingram and all these people to be so encouraging on this new journey as I kind of embark on it.\u201d",
      "JOY: I guess I never thought about it that way. There are so many wonderful artists that I draw inspiration from \u2014 Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington through the course of their lives contributed to the changing to the evolution of the music that we call jazz. I know that there\u2019s always gonna be a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain artist or song that people can connect to or relate to easily because jazz is not mainstream, at least to me, I don\u2019t think unless it is really, really, really, really watered down, I don\u2019t think it will be.",
      "But it\u2019s an opportunity for me to once again be authentic and show people like, \u201cHave you ever heard of this Abby Lincoln song?\u201d Or maybe this Thelonious Monk song doesn\u2019t have lyrics, but I can put lyrics to them and share a different, you know, a different compositional style. And a different voice in jazz. And so I guess that\u2019s my way of reclaiming it and educating in a way and just introducing people to the sound that they may not recognize at first, but good music is good music.",
      "JOY: I feel very honored and sometimes undeserving because of how new my relationship to their music was initially. I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first author who has now had censorship occur in two different types of media,\u201d Picoult says. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not out here to be salacious. I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical.

      "Picoult noted that the same Indiana high school has previously produced \u201cGrease,\u201d where the sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse is much greater, including a pregnancy scare, sex-mad teens and the line \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d",
      "\u201cBetween the Lines\u201d centers on Delilah, an outsider in a new high school, who finds solace in a book and realizes she has the power to write her own story and narrate her own life. \u201cIt is a very benign message. And it\u2019s actually a really important one for adolescents today,\u201d says Picoult.",

The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer. It played off-Broadway in 2022.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The union representing Broadway's musicians reached a tentative labor agreement with commercial producers on Thursday, averting a potentially crippling strike that would have silenced nearly two dozen musicals.",
      "The American Federation of Musicians Local 802 \u2014 which represents 1,200 musicians \u2014 had threatened to strike if they didn\u2019t have a new contract by the morning, after going into mediation Wednesday.",
      "Early Thursday, the union said it had struck a tentative deal that includes wage increases and contribution increases to the health fund.",
      "\"This three-year agreement provides meaningful wage and health benefit increases that will preserve crucial access to healthcare for our musicians while maintaining the strong contract protections that empower musicians to build a steady career on Broadway,\u201d AFM Local 802 President Bob Suttmann said in a statement.",
      "The 23 shows that could have gone silent ranged from megahits like \u201cHamilton\u201d and \u201cThe Lion King\u201d to newcomers like \u201cQueen of Versailles\u201d and \u201cChess,\u201d which are still in previews. Plays would not have been automatically impacted.",
      "It was the second Broadway labor deal in less than a week. Labor tensions had already seemed cool after Actors\u2019 Equity Association \u2014 which represents over 51,000 members, including singers, actors, dancers and stage managers \u2014 announced a new three-year agreement with producers over the weekend.",

      "Then there\u2019s the other baby \u2014 Morgan\u2019s daughter Clara (Mckenna Grace), about to turn 17, lovely, smart and aiming for drama school.

      "Yorgos Lanthimos' movies are farces, fables and experiments that reside in surreal worlds of their own",
      "The twisted filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos has by now trained us to expect darkly comic visions of contemporary life, both savage and mundane. His movies have perhaps inspired the most \u201cWhat?!\u201d reactions of the last decade, partly because they\u2019ve tried so hard to do so.",
      "His movies \u2014 farces, fables, experiments \u2014 reside in surreal worlds of their own. But his latest, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is thrillingly, if tragically, tied to our reality. It might even be his best film. Though I\u2019ve been apprehensive about the flamboyant severity of Lanthimos\u2019 movies, I found \u201cBugonia,\u201d a chamber-piece gut punch, hard to shake. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to resist any movie with a line in it like: \u201cThere\u2019s Andromedan code all over your Instagram.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s one of the things that Teddy (Jesse Plemons), an incel eco-terrorist, says to Michelle (Emma Stone) after kidnapping her with his neurodivergent cousin Donny (newcomer Aidan Delbis) and tying her up in their basement. Teddy and Donny live together in fairly remote, rundown old house. There, Teddy tends to both his bees and to unhinged conspiracy theories.",
      "But as Plemons so deftly plays him, Teddy doesn\u2019t seem like a lunatic. He might reach wildly insane conclusions, such as that Michelle, a pharmaceutical company chief executive, is an alien. But he\u2019s thoughtful in nature and sweetly cares for his cousin. It\u2019s a feat of Plemons\u2019 innate good nature that we kind of like Teddy, even as he shaves Michelle\u2019s head, to prevent \u201cit,\u201d as he calls her, from contacting the mothership.",
      "The opening moments of the script by Will Tracy (\u201cThe Menu,\u201d episodes of \u201cSuccession\u201d) cast these demented shenanigans in an apocalyptic light. The fate of bees is much on Teddy\u2019s mind; colony collapse disorder, often caused by pesticides, is one of his talking points. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, in \u201cBugonia\u201d \u2014 a movie reckoning with, or maybe just lamenting, humanity\u2019s fate \u2014 isn\u2019t just for the bees.",
      "While Stone\u2019s abilities alone might legitimize extraterrestrial suspicions, there\u2019s more to why Teddy has pinpointed Michelle. She\u2019s a lauded corporate leader; her office includes a framed Time magazine with her on the cover and a photograph with Michelle Obama. Her company, Auxolith, operates out of a sleek office building where Michelle presides over her workforce like a queen bee. She has the corporate lingo of \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d down pat, but whether she actually adheres to any of those ideals is dubious, at best. Before Teddy and Donny jump her, she announces a \u201cnew era\u201d at Auxolith where employees leave at 5:30 p.m. But not if they haven\u2019t met their quota, she adds. And not if they\u2019re, you know, busy.",
      "In that way, Michelle is a camera-ready cover for whatever Auxolith is up to, which, as the movie goes along, teases out a poisonous history, including opioid manufacturing that affected Teddy\u2019s mother (Alicia Silverstone).",

Understanding each other is futile. Watching Stone, as Michelle, attempt to reason with Teddy is part of the movie\u2019s dark fun, just as is seeing Plemons\u2019 Teddy resolutely stick to his certainty that Michelle is part of an alien infiltration of Earth that he wants gone by the next lunar eclipse.",
      "The source of such a wild narrative can only come, of course, from South Korea. \u201cBugonia\u201d is loosely based on the 2003 Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d All of Lanthimos\u2019 most notable films before have been written with either Efthimis Filippou (\u201cDogtooth,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d) or Tony McNamara (\u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite\u201d).

      "Yet what could easily be mistaken for a tossed-off, in-between movie \u2014 there are only a handful of characters and a few scene locations \u2014 ends up feeling like a culmination-slash-nadir for Lanthimos. Having made a dozen films darkly satirizing the sad, primal folly of humankind, it\u2019s comeuppance time in \u201cBugonia.\u201d",
      "The movie drags in the middle, when it\u2019s locked in a prisoner drama that grows a little tiresome and predictable. But the payoff is immense. Teddy calls his torture chamber \u201cthe headquarters of the human resistance.\u201d By the time \u201cBugonia\u201d reaches its unforgettable finale, it's made chillingly clear just how feeble any such movement might be, and the movie's apocalyptic air of resignation, of fait accompli, sounds a chastening death knell.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny\u2019s music, along with backlash.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s carefully thought through,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever selected an artist where we didn\u2019t have some blowback or criticism. It\u2019s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to be a great show,\u201d Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \u201cHe understands the platform that he\u2019s on, and I think it\u2019s going to be exciting and a united moment.\u201d",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \u201cnever heard of\u201d Bad Bunny.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Trump said. \"I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we try to achieve. It\u2019s an important stage for us. It\u2019s an important element to the entertainment value.\"",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if something does evolve. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re really focused on during the season.\u201d",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get more fouls. You\u2019re going to get different sets of fouls. You\u2019re going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\u201d",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\u201cThe negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThere are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I\u2019m certain that the players will raise, and that\u2019s what it should be. That\u2019s what collective bargaining is all about. They\u2019re going to need time to make sure that they\u2019re prepared, that they\u2019re ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\u201d",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and \u201829 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.",
      "Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company\u2019s 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.",
      "Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisty didn\u2019t just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\u201d",
      "In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.",
      "Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",

      "For a future professional dancer, she came to ballet relatively late \u2014 at 13 \u2014 but soon excelled and went on to study at the San Francisco Ballet School and ABT on scholarship opportunities. After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.",
      "In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer.

There\u2019s only so much that visual representation \u2026 can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\u201d",

      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",
      "Two of Pierre Bonnard's major works are prominently displayed \u2014 the lively and playful \u201cPlace Clichy,\u201d depicting a Paris square close to his studio, and \u201cThe Large Bathtub,\u201d portraying the artist's wife. They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "A prominent figure on the Greek cultural and intellectual scene, Savvopoulos died Tuesday night, his family announced on his official social media account. The musician had been hospitalized in recent days, and had been battling cancer for several years.",
      "Known by his nickname Nionios \u2014 a commonly used nickname for Dionysis \u2014 Savvopoulos rose to prominence in the 1960s, gaining national fame with his subtly revolutionary songs during the 1967-1974 military dictatorship. He was briefly imprisoned by the junta, and his songs became anthems of resistance for youths and dissidents in Greece.",

Because with his work and stance, he proved that he was a wonderful songwriter. A sensitive Greek.\u201d",

      "He wrote both the music and lyrics for most of his songs, which had deeply political, romantic and humorous content. His debut album, \u201cFortigo,\u201d meaning Truck, was released in 1966 and became a major success, propelled him to fame with its combination of political commentary, rock influences and Greek folk idioms.",
      "He solidified his success with is second album, \u201cThe Fool\u2019s Garden,\u201d released three years later in 1969, during the military dictatorship. Savvopoulos quickly became one of Greece\u2019s leading voices of artistic dissent, and by the time the junta fell in 1974, he was considered one of the most important and original Greek songwriters of his generation.",

      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Hurricane season can be stressful for anyone near the potential path of a storm, as powerful winds and heavy rain can cause widespread damage, cut power for days or weeks and otherwise upend people's lives.",
      "But the stress can be reduced if people have a plan for preparing their homes and for deciding whether to stay and ride out a storm or evacuate, according to emergency management officials. That preparation, which includes putting together a kit of essential supplies, should begin long before a storm is approaching.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, take preparedness seriously, spend the time now to do the little things that will make a big difference for you and your loved ones when something does happen,\u201d said Brian Mason, director of Houston\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.",
      "Anything in the backyard that isn\u2019t tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.",

      "Mason recommends that homeowners get their roofs inspected before each hurricane season and know how to turn off their utilities in case of damage.",
      "Well before a storm is brewing, people should trim or remove dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over their homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance.",
      "Hinote also urged people to review what type of insurance coverage they have and to make a home inventory of their possessions by taking photos of them in case an insurance claim needs to be made after a storm.",

      "Every family should have an emergency kit with supplies to meet its basic needs.",
      "For people who stay, a kit should include at least 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of water per day per person, with enough for up to seven days, Mason said. One way to have enough water is to fill a bathtub.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Sara from Middleville, Michigan, told Rep. John Moolenaar during his town hall that if health insurance premiums go up by as much as 75%, most people will probably go without heath care. \"So how do you address that?\u201d she asked.",
      "Moolenaar, who represents a district he handily won last year, responded: \u201cWe have time to negotiate, figure out a plan going forward and I think that\u2019s something that could occur.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans have shown urgent concern. In a letter sent to Johnson, a group of 13 battleground House Republicans wrote that the party must \u201cimmediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of health care affordability\u201d once the shutdown ends.",
      "\u201cWhile we did not create this crisis, we now have both the responsibility and the opportunity to address it,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",
      "Some Republicans dismiss projections that ACA premiums will more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law has fueled fraud and abuse that must be curbed.",
      "Many Democrats credited their ability to flip the House in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first term to the GOP\u2019s attempt at repealing Obamacare, and they\u2019re forecasting a similar outcome this time.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",
      "\u201cAt least among Republicans, there\u2019s a growing sense that just maintaining the status quo is very destructive,\u201d said Brian Blase, the president of Paragon Health Institute and a former health policy adviser to Trump during his first term.",
      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",
      "David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative group Club For Growth, told reporters Thursday that the group has \u201curged the Republicans not to extend those COVID-era subsidies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a big spending problem,\u201d McIntosh said.",

      "State officials in a report published in August said some of the chemicals can linger in the blood for several years after exposure. Research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also found it can take weeks to years for levels of many PFAS to decrease by half in human blood, assuming exposure isn't ongoing.",
      "It's not easy to draw a bright line between exposure and health effects, said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist with the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Working Group.",
      "\u201cThere are so many different factors that affect individual health outcomes and also affect what levels you will see in your blood,\u201d she said, explaining that a person's age, where they live, what they eat and drink and where they work can all play a role.",
      "According to slides shared with the audience, the tests in Curry County showed PFAS levels tend to increase with age, that males had higher levels, and those who had military or aviation careers had higher concentrations \u2014 all things consistent with national data.",
      "Watchdog groups that track PFAS nationwide say contamination is more widespread than previously thought. They're using data released by the EPA and states to compile maps showing spots across the country where drinking water systems report levels above what's recommended. Contamination has also been confirmed at hundreds of military bases around the country.",
      "That includes a base in southern New Mexico, where state officials are embarking on another health survey to gauge exposure at a nearby lake where scientists documented some of the highest PFAS levels in wildlife and plants worldwide.",
      "In Clovis, Thursday's audience was sparse but outspoken. They voiced frustrations that properties have been devalued and rural livelihoods threatened due to the contamination.",
      "New Mexico is among hundreds of plaintiffs that are part of multi-district litigation in a South Carolina federal court that aims to hold producers and users of PFAS-laden firefighting foam accountable for contamination at sites across the country.",
      "Separate from the legal front, some states have adopted their own PFAS rules while the focus of federal regulations have been narrowed. New Mexico just this week held a webinar on a new state law that calls for phasing out and ultimately prohibiting the sale of products containing intentionally added PFAS.",

      "It also comes during a moment of uncertainty for Affordable Care Act enrollees, with Congress deadlocked on how to handle expiring subsidies that have made marketplace health insurance less expensive for millions since 2021.

The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov.

      "Being pregnant changes many of the processes that allow the body to stay cool during extreme heat",
      "Doctors have long known that heat puts a strain on the heart, kidneys and other organs. Those risks are exacerbated for pregnant people, as the body's processes for staying cool are altered.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening. Intensifying extreme heat events, high temperatures well into the night and shattering weather records means more exposure for pregnant people, particularly in developing countries.",
      "Here's what to know about the science of pregnancy and extreme heat:",
      "Pregnancy changes the body in myriad ways, which can make it more difficult and uncomfortable to dissipate heat.",
      "\u201cAn obvious thing is, pregnant people have a belly bump, depending how far along they are, and that\u2019s a change in their surface to volume ratio,\u201d said Anna Bershteyn, an associate professor at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and director of Project HEATWAVE, an initiative aimed at improving research on preventing extreme heat deaths. Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "One way the body cools itself is by shunting blood toward the skin and away from the central organs, which is why a person's skin may flush and turn red when they get hot. Emerging research indicates that reduced blood flow to the placenta can affect the development of the fetus.",
      "For pregnant people handling potent substances like pesticides, increased blood flow can also increase chemical absorption, said Dr. Chris Holstege, chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.",
      "Research is beginning to show exposure to extreme heat even in the months before getting pregnant may affect a future pregnancy, said Cara Schulte, a researcher with the University of California Berkeley and the nonprofit Climate Rights International studying maternal health and heat.",
      "During pregnancy, even short-term exposure to heat can increase the risk of severe maternal health complications, such as high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy, according to the EPA. That includes preeclampsia, a condition that can be fatal for both mother and child.",
      "Heat can also worsen anxiety, depression and feelings of isolation and once the baby is born, \u201call of those things are compounded by this difficulty that postpartum women have in caring for their children in the heat,\u201d Schulte said.",

      "Aged between 41 and 60, some of the defendants are very active on the social media, with posts sometimes cumulating dozens of thousands of views.

      "Others include an elected official, a teacher and a computer scientist.",
      "The Macrons have for years been dogged by conspiracy theories that Brigitte was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux, who supposedly then took the name Brigitte as a transgender woman. Jean-Michel Trogneux is the name of Brigitte\u2019s brother.",
      "The two-day trial in Paris comes after the Macrons filed a defamation suit in July in a Delaware court as their lawyer said they\u2019ll be seeking \u201csubstantial\u201d damages from U.S. conservative influencer Candace Owens if she persists with claims that Brigitte is a man.",
      "Owens is a right-leaning political commentator whose YouTube channel has about 4.5 million subscribers. In 2024, she was denied a visa from New Zealand and Australia, citing remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II.",

      "Imams around Morocco have read government-written sermons urging parents to involve their children in public affairs",
      "RABAT, Morocco -- Worshippers sat shoeless on the red-carpeted floor of a mosque in Morocco's capital in silence, listening to a preacher in a raised pulpit reading a government-written sermon urging parents to involve their children in public affairs.",
      "The sermon, heard in mosques across the kingdom Friday, came after Morocco was shaken by an unprecedented and deadly youth uprising in recent weeks that demanded better social and economic conditions. The sermon didn\u2019t directly address the protests, but was seen by some as an effort by the government to send a message to demonstrators in the movement, known as Gen Z 212.",
      "Preachers traditionally chose the topics of their sermons that precede congregational prayers. But in recent years, governments in countries including Morocco, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have dictated sermon content. Officials say the move aims to curb extremist speech, but critics argue it turns sermons into tools for promoting the state\u2019s vision and backing its policies.",
      "In a mosque in the Moroccan capital of Rabat, the imam, dressed in a white djellaba robe and speaking on a microphone to hundreds of worshippers from different ages, social and economic backgrounds, urged the faithful to fulfill their duty to the nation by participating in civic life.",
      "\u201cOne of the most important things we should care about is raising children to participate in the managing of public affairs (...) and participation in serving the nation, loving the homeland and watching over its security and stability,\u201d the imam said.",
      "\u201cA true citizen is the one who serves his nation and does it well,\u201d he added, citing verses from the Quran, his voice echoing outside the mosque. Imams in Morocco are government employees, and sermons are standardized. The same sermon heard in Rabat is delivered across the country\u2019s 53,000 mosques and aired live on public television.",
      "The protests stemmed from anger over government spending in sports infrastructure for the 2030 World Cup while public services were perceived as neglected. They were organized on social media platforms like Discord by an anonymous group that rejects any affiliation to political parties and called for toppling a government it views as corrupt.",
      "Government officials said they heard the young activists\u2019 grievances and called on them to engage in dialogue and debate with institutions and in the public sphere. Several new measures, announced in a Cabinet meeting chaired by King Mohammed VI last week, are aimed at boosting youth political participation and job opportunities.",
      "They include a draft bill that would simplify election candidacy requirements for people younger than 35 and provide financial support covering 75% of their campaign fees. Many observers drew a direct link between the measure and the content of Friday\u2019s sermon.",
      "The government also said the 2026 budget draft will allocate a record $15 billion (140 billion dirhams) on health and education, billions more than what was spent this year, will create 27,000 jobs in the two sectors, upgrade 90 hospitals and improve the overall quality of education.",
      "In Friday's sermon, the imam cited examples of how disciples of Mohammed involved their children in councils to discuss public affairs.",

The appeal court of Agadir, a coastal city 296 miles (477 kilometers) from Rabat, sentenced 33 defendants to a total of 260 years in prison for vandalism, local media reported.",
      "\u201cI sincerely hope the real purpose behind these sermons is to support young people\u2019s participation in public affairs, not to guide or restrict them,\u201d said Soufiane, an 18-year-old college student at a weekend protest in Casablanca. He spoke on condition his last name not be used because of fear of retribution.",
      "He said Friday's sermons should be backed by real and transparent action, but also noted that they could be a powerful way to positively influence young people to engage in political life.",
      "After the government's promises and Friday's sermons, weekend protests drew fewer than expected participants. Only dozens appeared at Saturday's Casablanca gathering.",
      "\u201cFriday sermons serve as a tool for practicing politics through mosques, whether to defend the state\u2019s positions ... or to address other issues,\u201d said Dr. Driss El Ganbouri, a researcher specializing in religious affairs.",

      "The lawmaker, who has lived under round-the-clock protection for more than 20 years due to death threats, triggered Wednesday's snap elections in June by hauling his Party for Freedom ministers out of a fractious four-party ruling coalition in a dispute over his far-reaching plans to crack down on immigration.",

      "The outgoing government led by Dick Schoof, a career civil servant hand-picked by Wilders to become prime minister, went down in history as one of the shortest-lived in modern Dutch history and was notorious for infighting among its members.",
      "Wilders, whose party won 37 seats in the last election in late 2023, is unrepentant, arguing that he was left no choice but to bring down the government because other coalition parties balked at supporting his anti-immigration agenda.",
      "Most parties want to cut the number of migrants arriving in this often crowded nation of 18 million people. Other major issues are tackling a shortage of affordable housing and reining in soaring health care costs. Issues that have taken a back seat include the climate crisis and defense spending as Europe ramps up military readiness to counter Russian aggression.",

    "story": [
      "A report says at least 196 uncontacted Indigenous groups remain worldwide and face growing threats from logging, mining, missionaries and organized crime",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- From the depths of Brazil\u2019s Amazon to Indonesia\u2019s rainforests, some of the world\u2019s most isolated peoples are being squeezed by roads, miners and drug traffickers \u2014 a crisis unfolding far from public view or effective state protection.",
      "A new report by Survival International, a London-based Indigenous rights organization, attempts one of the broadest tallies yet, identifying at least 196 uncontacted Indigenous groups in 10 countries, primarily in the South American nations sharing the Amazon rainforest. Released Sunday, the report estimates that nearly 65% face threats from logging, about 40% from mining and around 20% from agribusiness.",
      "\u201cThese are what I would call silent genocides \u2014 there are no TV crews, no journalists. But they are happening, and they\u2019re happening now,\u201d said Fiona Watson, Survival's research and advocacy director, who has worked on Indigenous rights for more than three decades.",
      "The issue often receives little priority from governments, which critics say see uncontacted peoples as politically marginal because they don't vote and their territories are often coveted for logging, mining and oil extraction. Public debate is also shaped by stereotypes \u2014 some romanticize them as \u201clost tribes,\u201d while others view them as barriers to development.",
      "Survival\u2019s research concludes that half of these groups \u201ccould be wiped out within 10 years if governments and companies do not act.\u201d",
      "Uncontacted peoples are not \u201clost tribes\u201d frozen in time, Watson said. They are contemporary societies that deliberately avoid outsiders after generations of violence, slavery and disease.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t need anything from us,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy in the forest. They have incredible knowledge and they help keep these very valuable forests standing \u2014 essential to all humanity in the fight against climate change.\u201d",
      "Survival\u2019s research shows that more than 95% of the world\u2019s uncontacted peoples live in the Amazon, with smaller populations in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. These communities live by hunting, fishing and small-scale cultivation, maintaining languages and traditions that predate modern nation-states.",
      "Groups living in voluntary isolation have \u201cminimal to no contact with those outside of their own group,\u201d said Dr. Subhra Bhattacharjee, director general of the Forest Stewardship Council and an Indigenous rights expert based in Bonn, Germany. \u201cA simple cold that you and I recover from in a week \u2026 they could die of that cold.\u201d",
      "Beyond disease, contact can destroy livelihoods and belief systems. International law requires free, prior and informed consent \u2014 known as FPIC \u2014 before any activity on Indigenous lands.",
      "\u201cBut when you have groups living in voluntary isolation, who you cannot get close to without risking their lives, you cannot get FPIC,\u201d Bhattacharjee said. \u201cNo FPIC means no consent.\u201d",
      "Her organization follows a strict policy: \u201cNo contact, no-go zones,\u201d she said, arguing that if consent cannot be obtained safely, contact should not occur at all.",
      "The Associated Press reported last year on loggers killed by bow and arrow after entering Mashco Piro territory in Peru\u2019s Amazon, with Indigenous leaders warning that such clashes are inevitable when frontier zones go unpoliced.",
      "Watson, who has worked across the Amazon for 35 years, said early threats stemmed from colonization and state-backed infrastructure. During Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985, highways were bulldozed through the rainforest \u201cwithout due regard\u201d for the people living there.",
      "\u201cThe roads acted as a magnet for settlers,\u201d she said, describing how loggers and cattle ranchers followed, bringing gunmen and disease that wiped out entire communities.",
      "A railway line now planned in Brazil could potentially affect three uncontacted peoples, she said, but the rise of organized crime poses an even greater risk.",
      "Across Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, drug traffickers and illegal gold miners have moved deep into Indigenous territories. \u201cAny chance encounter runs the risk of transmitting the flu, which can easily wipe out an uncontacted people within a year of contact,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd bows and arrows are no match for guns.\u201d",
      "Evangelical missionary incursions have also caused outbreaks. Watson recalled how, under former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an evangelical pastor was placed in charge of the government\u2019s unit for uncontacted peoples and gained access to their coordinates. \u201cTheir mission was to force contact \u2014 to \u2018save souls,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat is incredibly dangerous.\u201d",
      "Protecting uncontacted peoples, experts say, will require both stronger laws and a shift in how the world views them \u2014 not as relics of the past, but as citizens of the planet whose survival affects everyone\u2019s future.",

But, she added, it must be done with extreme caution and from a distance to avoid contact that could endanger the groups\u2019 health or autonomy.",
      "Second, corporations and consumers must help stop the flow of money driving destruction. Survival\u2019s report calls for companies to trace their supply chains to ensure that commodities such as gold, timber and soy are not sourced from Indigenous lands.",
      "\u201cPublic opinion and pressure are essential,\u201d Watson said. \u201cIt\u2019s largely through citizens and the media that so much has already been achieved to recognize uncontacted peoples and their rights.\u201d",
      "Finally, advocates say the world must recognize why their protection matters. Beyond human rights, these communities play an outsized role in stabilizing the global climate.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

More than 24 million people were enrolled in the marketplace plans in 2025, up from about 11 million in 2020, according to an analysis from the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Sara from Middleville, Michigan, told Rep. John Moolenaar during his town hall that if health insurance premiums go up by as much as 75%, most people will probably go without heath care. \"So how do you address that?\u201d she asked.",

      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",

      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",

      "\u201cWe have a big spending problem,\u201d McIntosh said.",
      "\u201cI think most people are going to say, OK, I had a great deal during COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now it\u2019s back to business as usual, and I should be paying for health care.\u201d",

      "Efforts to back fill some of the cuts to U.S. foreign aid by the Trump administration raised over $125 million in eight months",
      "NEW YORK -- When the Trump administration froze foreign assistance overnight, urgent efforts began to figure out how to continue critical aid programs that could be funded by private donors.",
      "Multiple groups launched fundraisers in February and eventually, these emergency funds mobilized more than $125 million within eight months, a sum that while not nearly enough, was more than the organizers had ever imagined possible.",
      "In those early days, even with needs piling up, wealthy donors and private foundations grappled with how to respond. Of the thousands of programs the U.S. funded abroad, which ones could be saved and which would have the biggest impact if they continued?",
      "\u201cWe were fortunate enough to be in connection with and communication with some very strategic donors who understood quickly that the right answer for them was actually an answer for the field,\u201d said Sasha Gallant, who led a team at the U.S. Agency for International Development that specialized in identifying programs that were both cost effective and impactful.",
      "Members of Gallant's team, some of whom had been fired and others working outside of business hours, pulled together a list that eventually included 80 programs they recommended to private donors. In September, Project Resource Optimization, as their effort came to be called, announced all of the programs had been funded, with more than $110 million mobilized in charitable grants. Other emergency funds raised at least an additional $15 million.",
      "Those funds are just the most visible that private donors mobilized in response to the unprecedented withdrawal of U.S. foreign aid. It's possible private foundations and individual donors gave much more, but those gifts won't be reported for many months.",
      "For the Trump administration, the closure of USAID was a cause for celebration. In July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agency had little to show for itself since the end of the Cold War.",
      "\u201cDevelopment objectives have rarely been met, instability has often worsened, and anti-American sentiment has only grown,\u201d Rubio said in a statement.",
      "Going forward, Rubio said the State Department will focus on providing trade and investment, not aid, and will negotiate agreements directly with countries, minimizing the involvement of nonprofits and contractors.",
      "Some private donations came from foundations, who decided to grant out more this year than they had planned and were willing to do so because they trusted PRO's analysis, Gallant said. For example, the grantmaker GiveWell said it gave out $34 million it otherwise would not have to directly respond to the aid cuts, including $1.9 million to a program recommended by PRO.",
      "Others were new donors, like Jacob and Annie Ma-Weaver, a San Francisco-based couple in their late-thirties who, through their work at a hedge fund and a major tech company respectively, had earned enough that they planned to eventually give away significant sums. Jacob Ma-Weaver said the U.S. aid cuts caused needless deaths and were shocking, but he also saw in the moment a chance to make a big difference.",
      "\"It was an opportunity for us and one that I think motivated us to accelerate our lifetime giving plans, which were very vague and amorphous, into something tangible that we could do right now,\u201d he said.",
      "The Ma-Weavers gave more than $1 million to projects selected by PRO and decided to speak publicly about their giving to encourage others to join them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually very uncomfortable in our society \u2014maybe it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 to tell the world that you\u2019re giving away money,\u201d Jacob Ma-Weaver said. \u201cThere\u2019s almost this embarrassment of riches about it, quite literally.\u201d",
      "The funds that PRO mobilized did not backfill USAID's grants dollar for dollar. Instead, PRO's team worked with the implementing organizations to pare down their budgets to only the most essential parts of the most impactful projects.",
      "For example, Helen Keller Intl ran multiple USAID-funded programs providing nutrition and treatment for neglected tropical diseases. All of those programs were eventually terminated, taking away almost a third of Helen Keller's overall revenue.",

      "Shawn Baker, an executive vice president at Helen Keller, said as soon as it became clear that the U.S. funding was not coming back, they started to triage their programming. When PRO contacted them, he said they were able to provide a much smaller budget for private funders. Instead of the $7 million annual budget for a nutrition program in Nigeria, they proposed $1.5 million to keep it running.",
      "Another nonprofit, Village Enterprise, received $1.3 million through PRO. But they were also able to raise $2 million from their own donors through a special fundraising appeal and drew on an unrestricted $7 million gift from billionaire and author MacKenzie Scott that they\u2019d received in 2023. The flexible funding allowed them to sustain their most essential programming during what CEO Dianne Calvi called seven months of uncertainty.",
      "That many organizations managed to hold on and keep programs running, even after significant funding cuts, was a surprise to the researchers at PRO. Since February, the small staff supporting PRO have extended their commitment to the project one month at a time, expecting that either donations would dry up or projects would no longer be viable.",
      "\u201cThat time that we were able to buy has been absolutely invaluable in our ability to reach more people who are interested in stepping in,\u201d said Rob Rosenbaum, the team lead at PRO and a former USAID employee. He said they have taken a lot of pride in mobilizing donors who have not previously given to these causes.",
      "\u201cTo be able to convince somebody who might otherwise not spend this money at all or sit on it to move it into this field right now, that is the most important dollar that we can move,\u201d he said.",
      "Not all private donors were eager to jump into the chasm created by the U.S. foreign aid cuts, which happened without any \u201crhyme or reason,\" said Dean Karlan, the chief economist at USAID when the Trump administration took over in January.",
      "Despite the extraordinary mobilization of resources by some private funders, Karlan said, \u201cYou have to realize there\u2019s also a fair amount of reluctance, rightly so, to clean up a mess that creates a moral hazard problem.\"",
      "The uncertainty about what the U.S. will fund going forward is likely to continue for some time. The emergency funds offered a short term response from interested private funders, many of whom are now trying to support the development of whatever comes next.",
      "For Karlan, who is now a professor of economics at Northwestern University, it is painful to see the consequences of the aid cuts on recipient populations. He also resents the attacks on the motivations of aid workers in general.",
      "Nonetheless, he said many in the field want to see the administration rebuild a system that is efficient and targeted. But Karlan said, he hasn't yet seen any steps, \u201cthat give us a glimpse of how serious they\u2019re going to be in terms of actually spending money effectively.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Brazilian farmers are increasing soybean production as the U.S. and China engage in a trade fight",
      "SANTA CRUZ DO RIO PARDO, Brazil -- Brazilian farmer Andrey Rodrigues wasn\u2019t planning to beef up soybean production for next year\u2019s harvest until a couple of months ago, but now he\u2019s extra hopeful. What has him and his fellow Brazilian farmers planting more soybeans is the trade war between the Trump administration and China that has shut American soybeans out of the massive Chinese market.",
      "China is actively seeking out Brazilian producers and the local trading companies that buy Rodrigues' soybeans to sell to China have put the word out over the past two months that they will take all they can get, he said.",
      "Just how much China will buy from Brazil remains to be seen, but China's customs body said it did not import any soybeans from the U.S. in September. It's the first time that's happened since November 2018 when President Donald Trump launched his first trade war with China. Brazilian beans already accounted for more than 70% of China\u2019s imports last year while the U.S. share was down to 21% even before the current trade dispute began, World Bank data shows.",
      "Rodrigues, who chairs the soybean farmers association in Brazil\u2019s powerhouse Sao Paulo state, is ramping up production at his Morada do Sol farm in the city of Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo.",
      "The U.S.-China trade war \u201copens an opportunity for us here,\" said Rodrigues, as he kicked off the highly mechanized process on his farm on a recent sunny day. \"We need to be very aware in moments like this. Try to sell futures for the next harvest, seize this chance now.\u201d",
      "Brazil\u2019s government said that between January and August, 77 million metric tons of soybeans were exported to China. That represents most of the South American country's first season harvest.",
      "During that period, China imported 17 million metric tons from the U.S., according to China\u2019s customs data.",
      "As the U.S. soybean harvest begins, there's no indication that China is buying American.",
      "The number of cargo ships carrying U.S. grains and docking at a major Chinese grains port fell 56% between January and September this year over the same period the previous year, or from 72 to 32, according to a social media account of the state broadcaster China Central Television. The number has fallen to zero since July.",
      "By comparison, that port received an average of more than 40 cargo ships from countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay since May, and 90% of the cargo was soybeans, according to the state broadcaster\u2019s post.",
      "\u201cChina comes to us because of prices. Whenever they have higher tariffs in a given country, they come to us,\u201d said Rodrigues.",
      "The American Soybean Association said that China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on top of other taxes pushed the overall duties on U.S. soybeans to 34% in 2025, which has driven the price of American soybeans well above Brazil's.",
      "Brazil's Agriculture Ministry said in October it expected the next soybean harvest, the one that Rodrigues is planting now, to rise 3.6%, to almost 178 million metric tons in comparison with this year's. Now, government analysts are reviewing those figures as China's increased demand doesn't show signs of waning.",
      "But Livio Ribeiro, a partner at consultancy BRCG and a researcher at the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank and university in Rio de Janeiro, said the Chinese interest in Brazilian soybeans at this time of the year is a short-term move.",
      "\u201c(China) is retaliating against the U.S. and doing it with two alternative potential suppliers,\" Ribeiro said. Brazil has an edge over Argentina, because Lula is not ideologically aligned with the Trump administration like Argentina President Javier Milei, he added.",
      "\u201cThe West believed the U.S. was going to put its knee on China's neck and that they would capitulate quickly,\" Ribeiro said. \"I think people understand now that this is not the game, because China has much more bargaining power.\u201d",

He said when he traveled to China, buyers there told him that finding the lowest price was their priority.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s proved that they don\u2019t have a problem buying them someplace else,\u201d Cox said.",
      "The fear is that some farmers could go out of business as they deal with high costs and lower crop prices. But Minnesota farmer Glen Groth doesn't think that will happen. He said \u201closing the Chinese market isn\u2019t entirely unexpected nor is it seen as a complete catastrophe.\"",
      "\u201cWeather changes, politics changes, and you\u2019ve just got to deal with it,\u201d Groth said.",
      "Groth said he was able to sell his crop throughout the year at prices similar to last year with most of it floating down the Mississippi River about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from his farm.",
      "\u201cWe recognize that we\u2019re going to be an adversary at worst with the Chinese and in a contentious relationship at best with the Chinese,\u201d said Groth.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva is an ally of Chinese President Xi Jinping and has pushed for China to buy more Brazilian goods.",
      "But many soybean farmers like Rodrigues don't care that Lula has stood up to Trump. They credit their own work for their success, not Brazilian diplomacy trying to expand markets for their products.",
      "And while farmers are excited by China's interest at a time when they usually aren't selling, an official from Brazil's Industry and Trade Ministry cautioned that Beijing might wait before confirming purchases for the first half of 2026, because the price is higher now. That could be an incentive for Lula to seek other Asian buyers, said the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Rodrigues, the Brazilian farmer, says he doesn't want ideology to be part of the debate on tariffs.",
      "\u201c(American farmers) are being harmed and we have a temporary opportunity in Brazil. But let\u2019s think more broadly. Growing and doing well while others are being harmed is not nice. There needs to be harmony,\u201d Rodrigues said.",

      "China's ambition to rival Boeing and Airbus with its homegrown C919 passenger jet is hitting turbulent skies",
      "HONG KONG -- China\u2019s ambition to challenge Boeing and Airbus with its own homegrown passenger jet is running into turbulence, with deliveries of finished aircraft likely to fall far short of its target announced for this year.",
      "The C919 jet -- a single-aisle passenger plane aiming to rival Boeing\u2019s 737 and Airbus\u2019 A320 \u2013 is made by state-owned aircraft manufacturer COMAC. Beijing is showcasing it as evidence of China's technological advancement and progress in self-reliance, though it uses many Western sourced components.",
      "Trade friction with Washington threatens to prevent COMAC from securing core parts for the program that has been supported by huge Chinese government subsidies.",
      "\u201cCOMAC faces significant risk from the volatile policy environment, with its supply chains vulnerable to export restrictions and tit-for-tat measures between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Max J. Zenglein, Asia-Pacific senior economist at The Conference Board think tank.",
      "The C919 has 48 major suppliers from the U.S. -- including GE, Honeywell and Collins -- 26 from Europe and 14 from China, according to analysts at the Bank of America. Trump threatened to impose new export controls on \u201ccritical\u201d software to China after Beijing imposed stricter export controls on rare earths.",
      "\u201cExisting choke points are being exploited in the deal making process between governments,\u201d Zenglein said. \u201cThis is likely to continue as critical dependencies have become political bargaining chips.\u201d",
      "Beijing has high hopes for the C919, which made its maiden commercial flight in 2023. The mid-sized jet is meant to help fill vast domestic demand for new aircraft over the next few decades. China hopes to expand sales beyond its borders and fly globally, including in Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe.",
      "COMAC delivered 13 C919s to Chinese carriers last year and only seven as of October this year, despite plans to ramp up production and deliver 30 jets in 2025, according to the aviation consultancy Cirium.",
      "China\u2019s biggest state-owned airlines -- Air China, China Eastern and China Southern -- are the only commercial airlines currently flying a total of around 20 C919s.",
      "Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have \u201cdirectly affected\u201d delivery schedules for the C919, said Dan Taylor, head of consulting at aviation consultancy IBA. For one, output plans were disrupted when the U.S. suspended export licenses for the jet\u2019s LEAP-1C engines around May, resuming them in July, he said.",
      "U.S.-controlled technology that needs export licensing for the LEAP-1C engines -- jointly built by the U.S.\u2019s GE Aerospace and France\u2019s Safran -\u2014 means the C919's engines require U.S. export clearance, Taylor said, making it \u201cinherently sensitive to political shifts.\u201d",

      "Geopolitical tensions alone are not the only cause for slower than expected production of the C919s. The program has been \"marked by caution and prioritizing quality and safety, so there also may be some operational reasons for the slower production ramp up,\u201d said Zenglein from The Conference Board.",
      "While \u201cit has always been the aim to reduce the reliance on foreign components as quickly as possible\u201d for the C919, Zenglein said, many analysts say it is a challenging process. China's own engine alternative -- the CJ-1000A under development by state-owned Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) -- is still under testing, according to IBA.",
      "Several airlines outside of China, including AirAsia, have expressed interest in flying the C919, but a lack of international certification has so far prevented the C919 from flying beyond China. Certifications from the U.S. and the European Union\u2019s aviation regulators could take years.",
      "For the C919 to succeed, it \u201cneeds to have each one of three things: good economics, a prompt global product support network, and certification from safety agencies\u201d, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory. \u201cAny one of these three alone doesn\u2019t mean much,\u201d he said.",
      "China will need 9,570 new passenger aircraft between 2025 and 2044, according to Airbus\u2019 latest market forecast, more than 80% of them single-aisle jets like the C919.",
      "COMAC's faces a growing challenge from Airbus, which is expanding its manufacturing capacity in China. A second assembly line is due to begin operating in 2026, allowing Airbus to increase its production of A320 single-aisle jets in China \u2013 an aircraft model similar to the C919.",
      "Analysts expect that it will take years for COMAC to break the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in global aircraft share. By the late 2020s, COMAC will likely grow within China and possibly establish regional exports, said IBA\u2019s Taylor.",
      "In the near term, a lack of international certification will be \u201cdelaying any meaningful Western-market entry\u201d for the jet and export control volatility will likely continue to undermine its global expansion plans, Taylor added.",

      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Sunday that he\u2019s about make good on a threat to revoke millions in federal funds for California because he says the state is illegally issuing commercial driver\u2019s licenses to noncitizens.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d Duffy said California Gov. Gavin Newsom has refused to comply with U.S. Department of Transportation rules that require the state to stop issuing such licenses and review those already issued.",
      "\u201cSo, one, I\u2019m about to pull $160 million from California,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAnd, as we pull more money, we also have the option of pulling California\u2019s ability to issue commercial driver\u2019s licenses.\u201d",
      "Newsom\u2019s press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the matter Sunday, but California has defended its practices previously. When Duffy threatened to revoke funds last month, a spokesperson for Newsom dismissed the attack and noted that CDL holders from California have a significantly lower rate of crashes than both the national average and the Texas average, which is the only state with more licensed commercial drivers.",
      "Last month, the Transportation Department tightened commercial driver\u2019s license requirements for noncitizens after three fatal crashes that officials said were caused by immigrant truck drivers. Only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible for CDLs under the new rules and states must verify an applicant\u2019s immigration status in a federal database. The licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant\u2019s visa expires sooner.",
      "Duffy said last month that California should never have issued 25% of 145 licenses investigators reviewed. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver\u2019s work permit expired \u2014 sometimes years after. The state had 30 days to come up with a plan to comply or lose funding.",

It found licenses that were issued improperly in California, Colorado, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.",

      "\u201cSo you have 60,000 people on the roads who shouldn\u2019t have licenses,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cThey\u2019re driving fuel tankers, they\u2019re driving school buses, and we have seen some of the crashes on American roadways that come from these people who shouldn\u2019t have these licenses.\u201d",
      "Duffy said earlier this month that he would withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers. California defended its practices in a formal response to the Transportation Department, but federal officials were not satisfied.",
      "The investigation launched after the Florida crash found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.",

      "NEW YORK -- For nearly three years, JPMorgan Chase has picking up the legal tab of Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar, the two convicted fraudsters who sold their financial aid startup Frank to the bank.",
      "But the two have racked up an astronomical, nine-figure legal bill that far exceeds any reasonable amount the two may have needed for their defense, the bank said in a court filing late Friday. Chase shouldn't have to pay and its agreement as part of the startup purchase to shoulder the costs should end, the bank argued.",
      "According to the filing, Javice\u2019s team of lawyers across five law firms have billed JPMorgan approximately $60.1 million in legal fees and expenses, while Amar\u2019s lawyers have billed the bank roughly $55.2 million in fees.",
      "In total, the bank alleges Javice and Amar's lawyers have racked up legal fees of $115 million, with one law firm receiving $35.6 million in reimbursements alone. In comparison, Elizabeth Holmes, who was convicted of defrauding investors in the Theranos case, reportedly ended up with a legal bill of roughly $30 million.",
      "The bank would be \u201cirreparably injured\u201d if the court does not put an end to \u201cabusive billing,\" the bank said. Javice and her lawyers have treated the process \u201clike a blank check,\u201d Chase said.",
      "Javice, 33, was convicted in March of duping the banking giant when it bought her company, called Frank, in the summer of 2021. She made false records that made it seem like Frank had over 4 million customers when it had fewer than 300,000. Amar was convicted of the same charges.",

      "Jonathan Reckford shares insights from his 20 years as CEO of Habitat for Humanity International",
      "Jonathan Reckford jokes that before he became CEO of Habitat for Humanity International he couldn\u2019t really keep a job.",
      "In the two decades after he graduated from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Reckford had been a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs, coach of the Korean rowing team for the 1988 Olympics, and held executive and managerial positions at Marriott, Disney and Best Buy. He was executive pastor at Christ Presbyterian Church near Minneapolis, when he was recruited to lead Habitat in 2005.",
      "What Reckford did not expect was how the twin disasters of the Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina would make the global housing nonprofit expand its work so quickly. Or that they would make building affordable housing such a major priority.",
      "\u201cIt was an inflection point,\u201d Reckford, 63, told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cThose two giant disasters forced Habitat to change in some ways that I think had long-term benefits. We were designed as a grassroots movement to build a few houses in thousands of locations. Suddenly, we needed to work at scale in a few countries in Asia and then across the Gulf Coast. I\u2019m really proud of these enormous efforts.\u201d",
      "Reckford talked about other lessons learned in his 20 years leading Habitat, as he prepared for the annual Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project \u2014 the first since the death of Reckford's \u201chero and role model\u201d President Carter in December \u2013 which will build 25 sustainable homes in Austin, Texas, starting on Oct. 26. The interview was edited for clarity and length.",
      "Exactly. One thing we certainly see everywhere in the world \u2014 global North or global South \u2014 is it\u2019s 5 to 7 times cheaper to invest in mitigation than it is to fix stuff after the disaster. Another thing for the public to know is about 80% of the funds after a big disaster go to the relief effort. You certainly need all of that relief effort. But then there\u2019s very little left for long-term recovery. And the practical reality after these big disasters is that it\u2019s a 10-year cycle, a 15-year cycle to really come back.",
      "It does because we\u2019re seeing more extreme weather. It\u2019s not about politics. We\u2019re having more flooding events and we have an insurance crisis from an affordability perspective. We\u2019re investing in fortified housing. We always want to build relative to the risks in the area and we\u2019ve had a really good record. We\u2019re trying to do it to convince the insurance industry that families should get lower insurance payments because we\u2019ve created safer housing. It\u2019s just cost effective. It makes more sense to invest in lowering risk because it\u2019s incredibly expensive to do the rescuing afterwards.",
      "The day after I was announced, we drove and built the 200,000th Habitat home in Knoxville, Tennessee, and that meant Habitat had helped about a million people worldwide. As of last year, we\u2019ve helped another 61 million people. A big piece of that I would say was changing our framing question from \u201cHow many houses can we build?\u201d which was a really good question, to \u201cWhat would it take to actually address the housing need?\u201d",
      "What we found, especially in middle- and low-income countries, is that only about 5-10% of the population have access to a bank loan for housing. We started lending money to microfinance banks and training them on how to do home improvement lending.",
      "Those experiments went well enough that 12 years ago, we launched the MicroBuild Fund. We raised $100 million \u2014 borrowed $90 million of that, which was the first time we\u2019d ever taken on debt \u2014 and now, 12 years later, we\u2019re winding that fund down and getting ready to launch an even bigger fund.",
      "The fund has loaned out $230 million to 56 microfinance banks in 36 countries. Those banks found their home loan repayment rates have been as good or better than their small business loans, so it\u2019s created a new business channel for them. It\u2019s directly helped a million people make home improvements.",

      "And those banks have now put in $1.1 billion of their own capital, so we\u2019ve actually started to show proof that there is a market opportunity for giving small unsecured home improvement loans to very low-income families to do home upgrades. This is scalable on a level that we can\u2019t match. It\u2019s a much greater number than we could ever build.",
      "Yeah, I\u2019m sad to say you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll give you an oversimplified, quick version of how I\u2019ve seen this happen. We\u2019ve always had an affordability challenge. But what\u2019s really shocking in the last six years is how much worse it\u2019s gotten.",
      "If you go back to the housing crisis, lots has been written about what went wrong and how that sort of corrupted the whole housing value chain. But what really happened, in my view, is if you look at the small builders or the big builders after the housing crisis, the big builders got recapitalized and came back. The small builders didn\u2019t. And they represented, depending on the market, 50-60% of the housing supply.",
      "As we started under-building, initially, there was a ton of housing. But we had ten, 12 years of under-building by hundreds of thousands of units a year. The cumulative impact of that starts to add up. We need an \u201call of the above\u201d approach to address that.",

      "South Carolina's state-owned utility is negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management to revive a nuclear power project abandoned eight years ago",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's state-owned utility is looking to a private company to revive a project to build two nuclear power plants that was abandoned eight years ago, losing more than $9 billion without generating a watt of power.",
      "Santee Cooper's board agreed Friday to start six weeks of negotiations with Brookfield Asset Management that they hope will lead to a deal that lets the private company build the nuclear plants at the V.C. Summer site near Jenkinsville at their own risk to generate power that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers.",
      "Santee Cooper said Brookfield preliminarily agreed to provide the utility with some of the power generated. But that and probably thousands of other details will have to be negotiated. In a twist, Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building new nuclear reactors.",
      "Utility officials said the agreement gives hope the state can get something out of a debacle that led to four executives going to prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity.",
      "\u201cThe risk to the ratepayer is nil. The risk to the taxpayer is nil,\u201d Santee Cooper Board Chairman Peter McCoy said.",
      "There are still too many hurdles for the project to get past to consider this a win right now, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.",
      "After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, Clements said.",
      "\u201cI still believe that the cost, technical and regulatory hurdles are too big to lead to completion of the project,\u201d Clements said, adding the agreement appears to let Brookfield walk away if it decide it's not feasible.",
      "Santee Cooper heard from 70 bidders and received 15 formal proposals to restart construction of the reactors. Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.",

      "Some four years after players from the Afghanistan women\u2019s national team fled their homeland amid the Taliban\u2019s takeover, a number of the teammates are representing their country once more in an international soccer tournament",
      "Four years after players from the Afghanistan women's national team fled their homeland amid the Taliban's takeover, a number of the teammates are representing their country again in a soccer tournament. Only this time as refugees.",
      "The tournament represents a first major step in the fight to be officially recognized as a national team on the global stage. Collectively they call themselves Afghan Women United.",
      "\u201cIt's really exciting to see each other, hug each other and finally share and play together,\" said captain Fatima Haidari, who lives in Italy. \"As an athlete I say, you will face challenges and difficulties in your life, but you always can overcome and never give up. Never give up.\"",
      "FIFA, soccer's international governing body, is staging a four-team friendly tournament in Morocco that includes the refugee team along with Chad, Libya and Tunisia. The event dubbed FIFA Unites: Women\u2019s Series 2025, started Sunday.",
      "The tournament comes after years of lobbying by players, former captain and activist Khalida Popal, and human rights groups, to facilitate the team's return to competition.",
      "\u201cWith all the challenges that we have been through, all the barriers that we faced, finally, after four years and some months, the girls are playing football as the Afghan team,\" Popal said, \u201cbut with no title.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad the girls are playing. Is it enough? No. But it\u2019s a good start.\u201d",
      "The tournament was originally set for Dubai, and was to include Chad, Libya and the host United Arab Emirates. In Australia, where some members of the team have settled, there were media reports that the players were unable to obtain visas. FIFA didn't give a reason for the move.",
      "The Afghan women's national team played its last official competitive game in 2018. The Taliban regime's return to power in 2021 shut down all women's sports.",
      "But even before the demise of the team, the Afghan soccer federation was under investigation for misconduct involving the women's program, including allegations of rape and physical abuse. Keramuddin Keram, the federation president, was banned for life by FIFA.",
      "The players fled Afghanistan as the Taliban took over, fearing persecution. Some have spoken out about the harrowing ordeal, burning their kits to avoid detection and scrambling to get out.",
      "\u201cWe faced challenges or difficulties that I don\u2019t even want to remember because it was really bitter,\" Haidari said. \u201cIt is about leaving your homeland and all your friends, family and all the people that you know. What makes me sad is there are still some girls and women that are not playing, but they hope to be on the international pitch like us, like we are here now. We want to be their voice.\u201d",
      "While many ended up in Australia, there are Afghan players spread across Europe and some in the United States. FIFA held identification camps in Australia and England, calling in 70 players before whittling the roster down to 23 for the tournament, coach Pauline Hamill said.",

They\u2019ve been waiting a long time. And this tournament ... gives us the perfect chance to play matches together and then be really excited about the future.\u201d",
      "While the Afghan federation has obligations under FIFA statutes to avoid discrimination, it hasn't been suspended from international soccer despite failing to acknowledge the women's team.",
      "Players and their advocates have fought for official recognition. In May the FIFA Council approved the Strategy for Action for Afghan Women\u2019s Football. But the team cannot yet represent Afghanistan in Women's World Cup qualifying or Asian championships.",
      "While the tournament in Morocco is a first step, the goal is to become independent of FIFA, Popal said. But she wanted to emphasize that players are grateful to the organization for making this important move.",

      "Aaron Rodgers was solid but not spectacular in his first-ever game against the Green Bay Packers",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Aaron Rodgers spent the week insisting his first-ever game against the Green Bay Packers wasn't personal. That he wasn't looking for revenge against the team he defined for the better part of two decades.",
      "Good thing, because there was none to be had on Sunday night in Pittsburgh's 35-25 loss to Green Bay.",
      "Instead, there was only reminder after reminder that while the 41-year-old Rodgers can still compete at a high level, the team that surrounds him remains very much a work in progress. And maybe an iffy one at that.",
      "Rodgers threw for 219 yards and two scores in Pittsburgh's second straight loss, the first time he's ever looked across the field and watched the Packers celebrate victory on the other.",
      "\u201cDisappointed,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cDisappointed that I didn't play better, that we didn't play better, especially in the second half.\u201d",
      "Rodgers spent 18 years in Green Bay building a resume that will one day land him in the Hall of Fame. Four MVPs and a Super Bowl title will do that. Yet rather than retire as a Packer, Rodgers kept going.",
      "That journey eventually brought him to Pittsburgh, where he is serving as a highly skilled stopgap to whichever franchise quarterback might come next. Rodgers has shown flashes that he can still bring it when he has to in his 21st season. But the days when his brilliance can almost single-handedly overcome his team's considerable warts are over.",
      "After a promising 4-1 start, the Steelers have dropped two straight and while Rodgers has no interest in riding the weekly roller coaster that is the NFL season, he's also well aware there's too much for Pittsburgh to address for him to get caught up in playing \u201cremember when\u201d when talking about the Packers.",
      "Rodgers spent a chunk of the pregame catching up with old friends, many of them members of the Green Bay support staff who have remained following his departure.",
      "Yet when he was introduced to a loud and long ovation while wearing Pittsburgh's garish or inspired (depending on your perspective) throwbacks, Rodgers was all business. All Pittsburgh.",
      "He deftly guided the Steelers to four scoring drives in the first half while building a 16-7 lead. The problem is, three of those drives ended in long field goals by Chris Boswell instead of touchdowns.",
      "\u201cBos bailed us out on four incredible kicks, but when you're playing good teams, you need to score touchdowns, and we stalled out in the high red zone,\u201d Rodgers said.",

      "Pittsburgh's first five possessions in the second half went punt, field goal, punt, punt, fumble. A wholly unnecessary 15-yard penalty against wide receiver DK Metcalf blunted a late drive before it even started. A fumble by running back Kenny Gainwell set up a Green Bay field goal that effectively put the game out of reach.",
      "\u201cWe can't beat ourselves,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI think in the three losses, there's been times where we've had opportunities and we've hurt ourselves with turnovers or just negative plays. So we got to cut those out. We got to get on the same page on offense and defense and keep the faith.\u201d",
      "That faith will be tested in the coming weeks. Pittsburgh welcomes AFC South leading Indianapolis next week before a trip to Los Angeles to face the Chargers. There is plenty to clean up, particularly on a high-priced defense that has looked overmatched for long stretches and has now not produced a turnover in three straight games.",
      "If there is a saving grace for Rodgers, it's this: there are no longer any more former teams for him to face this season. Seven weeks after his tenure with Pittsburgh began with a four-touchdown masterpiece against the Jets, he watched Love put on a Rodgers-like performance while he and the Steelers sputtered at key times.",
      "Afterward, Rodgers and Love shared a brief embrace at midfield, with Love putting in a request to get a signed jersey from the man who showed him what it means to be a professional quarterback.",
      "And as discouraged as he might have been at the final score, Rodgers also couldn't help but take notice of his protege, the player who looks and plays at times an awful lot like his mentor.",
      "\u201cHe played great,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe played fantastic. He's had a really nice season. He's been really efficient with the football.\u201d",
      "All sentences that have been used to describe Rodgers at times during his career. Just maybe not on Sunday, when nostalgia gave way to the reality that there is work to be done if Rodgers wants his one-year coda in Pittsburgh to end on a more upbeat note than his time in Green Bay did.",

He thinks scientific innovation will curb it, and it\u2019s instead time for a \u201cstrategic pivot\u201d in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.",
      "A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said. In a memo released Tuesday, Gates said the world\u2019s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions in the world\u2019s poorest countries.",
      "If given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, Gates told reporters, \u201cI\u2019ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don\u2019t understand the suffering that exists today.\u201d",
      "The Microsoft co-founder spends most of his time now on the goals of the Gates Foundation, which has poured tens of billions of dollars into health care, education and development initiatives worldwide, including combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. He started Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to speed up innovation in clean energy.",
      "He wrote his 17-page memo hoping to have an impact on next month\u2019s United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. He\u2019s urging world leaders to ask whether the little money designated for climate is being spent on the right things.",
      "Gates, whose foundation provides financial support for Associated Press coverage of health and development in Africa, is influential in the climate change conversation. He expects his \u201ctough truths about climate\u201d memo will be controversial.",
      "\u201cIf you think climate is not important, you won\u2019t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",
      "University of Washington public health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi said she thoroughly agrees with Gates that the U.N. negotiations should focus on improving human health and well-being. But, she said, Gates assumes the world stays static and only one variable changes \u2014 faster deployment of green technologies \u2014 to curb climate change. She called that unlikely.",
      "Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, called the memo \u201cpointless, vague, unhelpful and confusing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no reason to pit poverty reduction versus climate transformation. Both are utterly feasible, and readily so, if the Big Oil lobby is brought under control,\u201d he wrote in an email.",
      "Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field said there is room for a healthy discussion about whether the current framing of the climate crisis is typically too pessimistic.",
      "\u201cBut we should also invest for both the long term and the short term,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cA vibrant long-term future depends on both tackling climate change and supporting human development.\u201d",
      "Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said he doesn't dispute the principle of making human well-being the primary objective of policy, but what about the natural world?",
      "\u201cClimate change is already wreaking havoc there,\" he wrote in an email. \"Can we truly live in a technological bubble? Do we want to?\u201d",

      "A decade ago, the world agreed in a historic pact known as the Paris agreement to try to limit human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. The goal: to stave off nastier heat waves, wildfires, storms and droughts.",
      "In a 2021 book, Gates laid out a plan for reducing emissions to avoid a climate disaster. But humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas by early 2028 that scientists say crossing that 1.5-degree threshold is now nearly unavoidable.",
      "Breakthrough Energy focuses on areas where the cost of doing something cleanly is much higher than the polluting way, such as making clean steel and cement. Gates concluded his memo by saying governments should work toward driving this difference to zero, and be rigorous about measuring the impact of every effort in the world\u2019s climate agenda.",
      "Gates said the pace of innovation in clean energy has been faster than he expected, allowing cheap solar and wind energy to replace coal, oil and natural gas plants for electricity and averting worst-case warming scenarios. Artificial intelligence is helping accelerate advances in clean energy technologies, he added.",
      "At the same time, money to help developing countries adapt to climate change is shrinking. Led by the United States, rich countries are cutting their foreign aid budgets. President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax.",
      "Gates criticized the aid cuts. He said Gavi, a public-private partnership started by his philanthropic foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years. Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000, he added.",
      "Vaccines become even more important in a warming world because children who aren\u2019t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply, he wrote.",
      "Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change, Gates said, citing research from the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab that found projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for the expected economic growth over the rest of this century.",
      "Under these circumstances, he thinks the bar must be \u201cvery high\u201d for what\u2019s funded with aid money.",
      "\u201cIf you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you\u2019re spending several million dollars on,\" he said, \u201cthat just doesn\u2019t make the cut.\u201d",

Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",

Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

      "Meta and TikTok can now file a response to the inquiry. Ultimately, the EU could fine the companies up to 6% of their annual profits \u2014 which could be in the billions.",

      "News stories in recent weeks about offensive or ill-advised text messages have blown up the careers of several young Republicans in a chat group, led a nominee for a White House job to drop out, threatened the campaign of a Democrat running for Virginia attorney general and embarrassed a federal prosecutor.",
      "Memories are still fresh of this spring's inadvertent inclusion of a journalist on a Signal chain where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other leaders discussed military strikes, possibly the second Trump administration's most embarrassing moment.",
      "For journalists, it's something else entirely. Bad smartphone behavior is fertile ground for reporters seeking insight into people who look to lead us \u2014 and presents a challenge to nail down stories when \u201cthat's fake\u201d looms as a default defense.",
      "Paul Ingrassia, who was President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration Tuesday. His Senate support had crumbled following Politico's Oct. 20 report that Ingrassia said in a text chain that he had a \u201cNazi streak\u201d and believed the federal holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. should be tossed into hell.",
      "Less than a week earlier, Politico exposed a Telegram chat group with leaders of youthful Republican groups across the country involved in casually racist and violent talk. So far, the outlet says seven people have lost jobs due to the story.",

      "He described texts as one of the few remaining frontiers of inadvertent authenticity. They recall past moments of infamy, like when President Richard Nixon made the ill-advised decision to tape his White House conversations, transcripts of which brought the phrase \u201cexpletive deleted\u201d into the American lexicon.",
      "There are countless cringeworthy moments caught on \u201chot\u201d microphones, such as during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, when President Ronald Reagan joked before a 1984 radio address that \u201cwe begin bombing in five minutes.\" Most public figures now know that virtually everyone around them carries a video camera-equipped smartphone.",
      "Some of the recently-unearthed text messages \u2014 Black people called monkeys or \u201cwatermelon people,\u201d images of gas chambers or urinating on the graves of opponents \u2014 are stunning and dark. You can't help but wonder: what were they thinking? Were they thinking?",
      "Probably not, in part because texting is such a ubiquitous, low-friction form of communication in today's world, said Cal Newton, professor of computer science at Georgetown University. Guards that people have up when talking with other people \u2014 be reasonable, civil, careful \u2014 are often missing.",
      "Some parts of our brain \u201cdon't recognize text on a glowing piece of glass as \u2018I\u2019m in a conversation with other people,'\u201d Newton said. Bad impulses, and the tendency to amplify or exaggerate, slip out because they can't see reactions.",
      "Still, it's not like people don't understand, on some level, that they're communicating on a medium where conversations can be saved on screen shots. There were nervous warning signs in some of the chats: \u201cIf we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked,\u201d one young Republican said.",

      "Beyond texts, Burns said Politico is in the market for other insightful open source reporting, such as audio, video or behind-the-scenes memos. He would not say whether the Ingrassia texts came as direct result of how Politico handled its previous story, but he believes his outlet has proven it has handled these stories responsibly.",

      "The Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote at length about how he handled being added to the Signal text chain about military operations. He, too, initially thought it was a hoax.

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

      "But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.",

      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",

      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",
      "Scientists have been uncovering dinosaur mummies for over a century. Some were buried quickly after dying, while others sank into bodies of water or dried out.",
      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

      "New research suggests that dinosaur populations were thriving in North America before the asteroid impact 66 million years ago that caused mass extinction",
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it\u2019s only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\u201cDinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that\u2019s been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\u201d the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \u201crun counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\u201d he said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex, a huge, long-necked dinosaur, and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",

      "Clippy, the animated paper clip that annoyed Microsoft Office users nearly three decades ago, might have just been ahead of its time.",
      "Microsoft introduced a new artificial intelligence character called Mico (pronounced MEE'koh) on Thursday, a blob-shaped cartoon face that will embody the software giant's Copilot virtual assistant and marks the latest attempt by tech companies to imbue their AI chatbots with more of a personality.",
      "Copilot's cute new emoji-like exterior comes as AI developers face a crossroads in how they present their increasingly capable chatbots to consumers without causing harm or backlash. Some have opted for faceless symbols, others are selling flirtatious, human-like avatars and Microsoft is looking for a middle ground that's friendly without being obsequious.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about something sad, you can see Mico\u2019s face change. You can see it dance around and move as it gets excited with you,\u201d said Jacob Andreou, corporate vice president of product and growth for Microsoft AI, in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s in this effort of really landing this AI companion that you can really feel.\u201d",
      "In the U.S. only so far, Copilot users on laptops and phone apps can speak to Mico, which changes colors and wears glasses when in \u201cstudy\u201d mode. It's also easy to shut off, which is a big difference from Microsoft's Clippit, better known as Clippy and infamous for its persistence in offering advice on word processing tools when it first appeared on desktop screens in 1997.",
      "\u201cIt was not well-attuned to user needs at the time,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cMicrosoft pushed it, we resisted it and they got rid of it. I think we\u2019re much more ready for things like that today.\u201d",
      "Reimer, co-author of a new book called \u201cHow to Make AI Useful,\u201d said AI developers are balancing how much personality to give AI assistants based on who their expected users are.",
      "Tech-savvy adopters of advanced AI coding tools may want it to \u201cact much more like a machine because at the back end they know it\u2019s a machine,\u201d Reimer said. \u201cBut individuals who are not as trustful in a machine are going to be best supported \u2014 not replaced \u2014 by technology that feels a little more like a human.\u201d",
      "Microsoft, a provider of work productivity tools that is far less reliant on digital advertising revenue than its Big Tech competitors, also has less incentive to make its AI companion overly engaging in a way that's been tied to social isolation, harmful misinformation and, in some cases, suicides.",
      "Andreou said Microsoft has watched as some AI developers veered away from \u201cgiving AI any sort of embodiment,\u201d while others are moving in the opposite direction in enabling AI girlfriends.",

But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",

      "Reddit has sued Perplexity AI and three other entities for allegedly scraping user comments for commercial gain",
      "Social media platform Reddit sued the artificial intelligence company Perplexity AI and three other entities on Wednesday, alleging their involvement in an \u201cindustrial-scale, unlawful\u201d economy to \u201cscrape\u201d the comments of millions of Reddit users for commercial gain.",
      "Reddit's lawsuit in a New York federal court takes aim at San Francisco-based Perplexity, maker of an AI chatbot and \u201canswer engine\u201d that competes with Google, ChatGPT and others in online search.",
      "Also named in the lawsuit are Lithuanian data-scraping company Oxylabs UAB, a web domain called AWMProxy that Reddit describes as a \u201cformer Russian botnet,\u201d and Texas-based startup SerpApi.",
      "It's the second such lawsuit from Reddit since it sued another major AI company, Anthropic, in June.",
      "But the lawsuit filed Wednesday is different in the way that it confronts not just an AI company but the lesser-known services the AI industry relies on to acquire online writings needed to train AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cScrapers bypass technological protections to steal data, then sell it to clients hungry for training material. Reddit is a prime target because it\u2019s one of the largest and most dynamic collections of human conversation ever created,\u201d said Ben Lee, Reddit\u2019s chief legal officer, in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Perplexity said it has not yet received the lawsuit but \u201cwill always fight vigorously for users\u2019 rights to freely and fairly access public knowledge. Our approach remains principled and responsible as we provide factual answers with accurate AI, and we will not tolerate threats against openness and the public interest.\u201d",
      "Oxylabs and SerpAPI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. AWMProxy could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "Reddit compares the companies it is suing to \u201cwould-be bank robbers\u201d who can't get into the bank vault, so they break into the armored truck instead. The lawsuit alleges they are evading Reddit\u2019s own anti-scraping measures while also \u201dcircumventing Google\u2019s controls and scraping Reddit content directly from Google\u2019s search engine results.\"",

Perplexity is a willing customer of at least one of these scrapers, choosing to buy stolen data rather than enter into a lawful agreement with Reddit itself.\u201d",
      "Much like its lawsuit against Anthropic, maker of the chatbot Claude, Reddit claims that Perplexity has accessed Reddit\u2019s content despite being asked not to do so.",

Some ends up in informal scrapyards, where workers burn or dismantle devices by hand, often without protection, releasing toxic fumes and scrap.",

      "Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power",
      "Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power. But scientists are also experimenting with ways that AI can help people and businesses use energy more efficiently and pollute less.",
      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",
      "Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.",
      "\u201cI am pretty optimistic that while more and more AI use is going to continue to increase,\u201d said Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia University Climate School, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see our ability to process be much more efficient and as a result, the energy consumption won\u2019t go up as much as some are predicting.\u201d",
      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s literally a super low-hanging fruit,\" said Zoltan Nagy, professor of building services at Eindhoven University of Technology.",
      "AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.",
      "This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it\u2019s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s a peak period when everybody\u2019s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn\u2019t start charging right away because it\u2019s peak period time,\u201d Abramson said.",

      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says:",
      "\u201cWe call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\u201d",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

Most people don\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\u201d said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cI feel what we\u2019re really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\u201d",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\u201d Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful AI models temporarily. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\u201cI really empathize for them, frankly, because they\u2019re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\u201d Tegmark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\u201d",

      "A California woman on trial for taking four chickens from one of Perdue Farms\u2019 major poultry plants has put animal treatment at slaughter houses in the national spotlight as the defense argues she rescued the birds from abuse",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A California woman on trial for taking four chickens from one of Perdue Farms' major poultry plants has put animal treatment at slaughter houses in the national spotlight as her defense team argues she rescued the birds from abuse.",
      "Closing statements are scheduled for Tuesday in a case that could land Zoe Rosenberg, 23, in prison for more than five years. During the seven-week trial, her defense hasn't focused on if she took the chickens from Petaluma Poultry in 2023 \u2014 Rosenberg shared the video of the theft online and has posted on social media to hundreds of thousands of followers throughout the trial \u2014 but rather the justification for doing so.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have argued the case isn\u2019t about why she took the chickens, but that she committed an illegal act.",
      "\u201cThis is not a whodunit. This is a why-dunit,\u201d said Kevin Little, one of Rosenberg\u2019s lawyers, during his opening statement.",
      "He said Rosenberg, who has been charged with three misdemeanors and felony conspiracy, investigated the plant for two months before taking the birds and consulted a veterinarian who was concerned about images that appeared to show animals being boiled alive. Chris Carraway, her other attorney, said in a statement that this \u201cwas a rescue, not a crime.\u201d",
      "Rosenberg is an animal rights activist with the group Direct Action Everywhere, or DxE, which is known for animal rescues and protests that often garner national attention. Perdue Farms is one of the largest poultry producers in the country and supplies such major grocery chains as Safeway.",
      "In recent years, similar cases involving animal rights activists have had mixed results in front of juries across the U.S. But in California's Sonoma County, where agriculture is one of the main industries, Rosenberg faces an especially uphill battle. The county is believed to have prosecuted more animal rights cases than any other in the country, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.",
      "As a condition to stay out of custody, Rosenberg had to wear an ankle monitor while attending classes at the University of California, Berkeley, up until around the beginning of the trial last month.",
      "\u201cAn immense amount of government resources have been spent prosecuting me for the alleged \u2018crime\u2019 of rescuing four abused chickens from a Perdue slaughterhouse,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post on Monday.",
      "\u201cMost distressing, however, is the fact that these resources are not being spent on stopping the criminal animal cruelty at Perdue\u2019s facilities. Poppy, Ivy, Aster, and Azalea are safe but so many others are not,\" she said, referencing the names her group gave to the chickens she took.",
      "Prosecutors say Rosenberg entered Petaluma Poultry without authorization four times and attached GPS devices to 12 delivery vehicles before taking the chickens from a trailer and leaving with them, while about 50 DxE members demonstrated outside, the Press Democrat reported.",

      "Rosenberg testified she disguised herself as a Petaluma Poultry worker using a fake badge and earpiece, the Press Democrat reported. She and other members of the group filmed the action and shared it. She said she was acting out of concern for animal cruelty, not as part of a criminal conspiracy.",

      "Team officials wanted Flav to start from a low spot on the track, as is the case with all first-timers for safety reasons. Flav didn\u2019t necessarily like that; he wanted to start from higher up, significantly raising the level of difficulty. Eventually, he got his chance and he hit 67 mph on his second run.",
      "For a regular person just trying the sport, that's exceptional. No word on whether he used his catch phrase, \u2018Yeah, boyeeeee.\u2019",

      "The testimony is expected in a civil trial for a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Skaggs' family contending the Angels should be held responsible for letting a drug-addicted and dealing employee stay on the job and access its players.

      "Centuries-old private libraries are bringing modern comfort and awe to book lovers and history buffs in New England",
      "BOSTON -- When David Arsenault takes down a worn, leather-bound 19th-century book from the winding shelves of the Boston Athenaeum, he feels a sense of awe \u2014 like he\u2019s handling an artifact in a museum.",
      "Many of the half a million books that line the library's seemingly endless maze of reading room shelves and stacks were printed before his great-great-grandparents were born. Among fraying copies of Charles Dickens novels, Civil War-era biographies and town genealogies, everything has a history and a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cIt almost feels like you shouldn\u2019t be able to take the books out of the building, it feels so special,\u201d said Arsenault, who visits the institution adjacent to Boston Common a few times a week. \u201cYou do feel like, and in a lot of ways, you are, in a museum \u2014 but it\u2019s a museum you get to not feel like you\u2019re a visitor in all the time, but really a part of.\u201d",
      "The more than 200-year-old institution is one of only about 20 member-supported private libraries in the U.S. dating back to the 18th- and 19th-centuries. Called athenaeums, a Greek word meaning \u201ctemple of Athena,\u201d the concept predates the traditional public library most Americans recognize today. The institutions were built by merchants, doctors, writers, lawyers and ministers who wanted to not only create institutions for reading \u2014 then an expensive and difficult-to-access hobby \u2014 but also space to explore culture and debate.",
      "Many of these athenaeums still play a vibrant role in their communities.",
      "Patrons gather to play games, join discussions on James Joyce, or even research family history. Others visit to explore some of the nation\u2019s most prized artifacts, such as the largest collection from George Washington \u2019s personal library at Mount Vernon at the Boston Athenaeum.",
      "In addition to conservation work, institutions acquire and uplift the work of more modern creatives who may have been overlooked. The Boston Athenaeum recently co-debuted an exhibit by painter Allan Rohan Crite, who died in 2007 and used his canvas to depict the joy of Black life in the city.",
      "One thing binds all athenaeums together: books and people who love them.",
      "\u201cThe whole institution is built around housing the books,\u201d said Matt Burriesci, executive director of Providence Athenaeum in Rhode Island. \u201cThe people who come to this institution really appreciate just holding a book in their hands and reading it the old-fashioned way.\u201d",
      "Built to mimic an imposing Greek temple, staffers at the Providence Athenaeum often talk about the joy of watching people enter for the first time.",
      "Visitors must climb a series of cold, granite steps. Only then are they met with a thick wooden door that ushers them into a warm world filled with cozy reading nooks, hidden desks to leave secret messages to fellow patrons, and almost every square inch bursting with books.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the actual time capsule of people\u2019s reading habits over 200 years,\u201d Burriesci said, while pointing to a first-edition of Little Women, where the pages and spine proudly showcase years of being well read.",
      "Many athenaeums are designed to pay tribute to Greek influence and their namesake, the goddess of wisdom. In Boston, a city once dubbed \u201cthe Athens of America,\u201d visitors to the athenaeum are greeted by a nearly 7-foot-tall (2.1-meter-tall) bronze statue of Athena Giustiniani.",

      "The 12-level building includes five gallery floors where ornate busts of writers and historical figures decorate reading rooms with wooden tables overlooked by book-lined pathways reachable by spiral and hidden staircases.",
      "Natural light shines in from large windows where guests can look down to see one of Boston's most historic cemeteries where figures like Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock are buried.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to leave many of these things out for people to peruse, and I think people can often get curious about something and just follow their curiosity into things that they didn\u2019t even know that they were going to be fascinated by,\u201d said Boston Athenaeum executive director Leah Rosovsky.",
      "When athenaeums were founded, they were exclusive spaces that only people with education and money could access.",
      "Some are now free. Most are open to the public for day passes and tours. Memberships to the Boston Athenaeum can range from $17 to $42 a month per person, depending on whether the patron is under 40 or is sharing the membership with family members.",
      "Charlie Grantham, a wedding photographer and aspiring novelist, said she first visited during one of the institution\u2019s annual community days, where the public can explore for free. She said she was surprised by how accessible it was and describes the space as \u201cBoston\u2019s best kept secret \u2014 an oasis in the middle of the city.\u201d",

    "summary": "More anti-abortion pregnancy centers have been offering medical services such as testing for sexually transmitted infections",
    "story": [
      "More anti-abortion pregnancy centers have been offering medical services such as testing for sexually transmitted infections",
      "Pregnancy centers in the U.S. that discourage women from getting abortions have been adding more medical services \u2014 and could be poised to expand further.",
      "The expansion \u2014 ranging from testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections to even providing primary medical care \u2014 has been unfolding for years. It gained steam after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years ago, clearing the way for states to ban abortion.",
      "The push could get more momentum with Planned Parenthood closing some clinics and considering shuttering others following changes to Medicaid. Planned Parenthood is not just the nation's largest abortion provider, but also offers cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and other reproductive health services.",
      "\u201cWe ultimately want to replace Planned Parenthood with the services we offer,\u201d said Heather Lawless, founder and director of Reliance Center in Lewiston, Idaho. She said about 40% of patients at the anti-abortion center are there for reasons unrelated to pregnancy, including some who use the nurse practitioner as a primary caregiver.",
      "The changes have frustrated abortion-rights groups, who, in addition to opposing the centers' anti-abortion messaging, say they lack accountability; refuse to provide birth control; and most offer only limited ultrasounds that cannot be used for diagnosing fetal anomalies because the people conducting them don't have that training. A growing number also offer unproven abortion-pill reversal treatments.",
      "Because most of the centers don't accept insurance, the federal law restricting release of medical information doesn't apply to them, though some say they follow it anyway. They also don't have to follow standards required by Medicaid or private insurers, though those offering certain services generally must have medical directors who comply with state licensing requirements.",
      "\u201cThere are really bedrock questions,\u201d said Jennifer McKenna, a senior adviser for Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, a project funded by liberal policy organizations that researches the pregnancy centers, \u201cabout whether this industry has the clinical infrastructure to provide the medical services it\u2019s currently advertising.\u201d",
      "Perhaps best known as \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d these mostly privately funded and religiously affiliated centers were expanding services such as diaper banks ahead of the Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling.",
      "As abortion bans kicked in, the centers expanded medical, educational and other programs, said Moira Gaul, a scholar at the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of SBA Pro-Life America. \u201cThey are prepared to serve their communities for the long-term,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "In Sacramento, California, for instance, Alternatives Pregnancy Center in the last two years has added family practice doctors, a radiologist and a specialist in high-risk pregnancies, along with nurses and medical assistants. Alternatives \u2014 an affiliate of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of pregnancy centers in the U.S \u2014 is some patients' only health provider.",
      "When The Associated Press asked to interview a patient who had received only non-pregnancy services, the clinic provided Jessica Rose, a 31-year-old woman who took the rare step of detransitioning after spending seven years living as a man, during which she received hormone therapy and a double mastectomy.",
      "For the last two years, she\u2019s received all medical care at Alternatives, which has an OB-GYN who specializes in hormone therapy. Few, if any, pregnancy centers advertise that they provide help with detransitioning. Alternatives has treated four similar patients over the past year, though that's not its main mission, director Heidi Matzke said.",
      "\u201cAPC provided me a space that aligned with my beliefs as well as seeing me as a woman,\u201d Rose said. She said other clinics \"were trying to make me think that detransitioning wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do.\u201d",
      "As of 2024, more than 2,600 anti-abortion pregnancy centers operated in the U.S., up 87 from 2023, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, a project led by University of Georgia public health researchers who are concerned about aspects of the centers. According to the Guttmacher Institute, 765 clinics offered abortions last year, down more than 40 from 2023.",
      "Over the years, pregnancy centers have received a boost in taxpayer funds. Nearly 20 states, largely Republican-led, now funnel millions of public dollars to these organizations. Texas alone sent $70 million to pregnancy centers this fiscal year, while Florida dedicated more than $29 million for its \u201cPregnancy Support Services Program\u201d",
      "This boost in resources is unfolding as Republicans have barred Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds under the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. While federal law already blocked the use of taxpayer funds for most abortions, Medicaid reimbursements for other health services were a big part of Planned Parenthood's revenue.",

      "Thomas Glessner, founder and president of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a network of 1,800 centers, said the centers do have government oversight through their medical directors. \u201cTheir criticism,\u201d he said, \u201ccomes from a political agenda.\u201d",
      "In recent years, five Democratic state attorneys general have issued warnings that the centers, which advertise to people seeking abortions, don't provide them and don't refer patients to clinics that do.

      "Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, with limited experience in international affairs, will have to manage Trump's demands and unpredictability and China's wariness of her strong support for a military build-up and her right-wing views on Japan's invasion of China before and during World War II.",
      "She arrives in Malaysia on Saturday for meetings with Southeast Asian leaders, then returns to Japan to meet Trump before heading to South Korea for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit at the end of the week.",
      "In her first news conference as prime minister, she described her schedule as \u201cpacked\u201d with diplomatic events and said it will be a valuable opportunity to meet other regional leaders.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping will also attend the summit in South Korea, where talks with Trump are planned, but a one-on-one meeting with Takaichi would be a surprise.",
      "Neither Xi nor Chinese Premier Li Qiang has publicly congratulated Takaichi since she became prime minister on Tuesday. They extended immediate congratulations to her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who held more moderate positions on China.",
      "America has long been Japan\u2019s most important ally and protector, but as with NATO and other allies, Trump has demanded Japan contribute more for its defense. His tariffs on imports have also delivered a blow to the country\u2019s economy.",
      "Takaichi pledged Friday to accelerate a plan to increase defense spending to 2% of Japan's GDP, a measure of the size of the economy. The target would be reached in March instead of 2027, she said.",
      "\u201cIn the region around Japan, military activities and other actions from our neighbors China, North Korea and Russia are causing grave concerns,\u201d she said in a policy speech to parliament.",
      "Trump may be more focused in both Japan and South Korea on his demands for more investment in the United States, particularly for factories that would create jobs for American workers.",
      "Takaichi could benefit from being a political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who appeared to have won Trump\u2019s trust during the American president\u2019s first term.",
      "She shares Abe's views on wartime history, perhaps even more strongly than he did. Before becoming prime minister, she was among conservative lawmakers who regularly paid respects to Japan\u2019s war dead at Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.",
      "The visits anger both China and South Korea because the enshrined include former leaders convicted of war crimes for their actions during World War II.",
      "Takaichi notably skipped a visit during the autumn festival earlier this month, when it appeared likely she would become Japan\u2019s leader.",
      "Her paramount mission now is political stability, and experts think she will refrain from expressing her views on the war and stay away from the shrine to avoid any flareups that could shake her weak and untested coalition government.",
      "\u201cIt would be so foolish of her especially in her first year to create a major diplomatic incident because she wants to go to Yasukuni Shrine,\u201d said Gerald Curtis, a Japanese politics expert at Columbia University.",

At the time, it was one of Mamdani's most significant endorsements in his bid for mayor.",

She worked for the city fire department for more than 25 years and held nearly every role, including fire marshal, engineer and battalion chief.",
      "Fire officials, including Crowley, expressed concerns over budget cuts that left the department understaffed and fire trucks sitting idle in the maintenance yard because they didn't have mechanics to fix them. The firefighters union sharply criticized Bass\u2019 decision, calling Crowley a \u201cscapegoat.\u201d",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Actress June Lockhart (June 25, 1925-Oct 23, 2025) was best known for roles in two popular TV series: as Ruth Martin in \"Lassie,\" and as Maureen Robinson, matriarch of a family that was \"Lost in Space.\"",
      "The daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, June appeared on stage in New York beginning at age 6. After her parents moved to Hollywood, she made her unbilled film debut at age 13 alongside Gene and Kathleen, who played Bob Cratchit and his wife, in 1938's \"A Christmas Carol.\" June's first credit was in the Bette Davis drama \"All This, and Heaven Too.\" \u00a0She appeared in \"Sergeant York,\" \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"She-Wolf of London,\" and won a Tony Award for the 1947 comedy \"For Love or Money.\" But her starring role in 1945's \"Son of Lassie\" (as the adult version of the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original) foreshadowed what would become her most familiar role.",
      "In 1958, Lockhart joined the TV series \"Lassie\" as Ruth Martin (taking over the role played by Cloris Leachman). For six years, in more than 200 episodes, Lockhart dispensed motherly wisdom to young Timmy (Jon Provost), who would engage in less-than-proper behavior or find himself in danger (but never, as the trope suggested, fallen down a well), only to be rescued by his faithful collie.",
      "And she knew who the star of the show was. \"Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it,\" she told The New York Times in 2004.",
      "The show, which aired on CBS, featured scripts that were in some cases written by blacklisted writers. \"When people come up to me and say, 'Well, sure wish we had wonderful American shows like that the way we used to in the 50's,' I say, 'Let me tell you who wrote those scripts Yes, they were good Americans, and they were in jail,'\" she said.",
      "Beginning in 1965, Lockhart starred in the frequently campy science fiction series \"Lost in Space.\" For three seasons, the Robinson Family \u2013 crewmembers aboard the doomed Jupiter II spacecraft \u2013 were marooned, or attacked by monsters and evil aliens (and in one notorious incident, a talking carrot), all while dealing with typical family drama. \"It was really endearing. 'Lost in Space' was like going out in the backyard in the sand and playing space. We did have fun,\" she said at a 2010 public appearance. She was also a NASA spokesperson, and attended space shuttle launches.",
      "In 1968, she joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the sitcom's last two seasons. She also appeared on \"General Hospital,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Ellery Queen,\" \"Quincy, M.E.,\" \"Vega$,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Knots Landing,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Full House,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Cold Case.\" She provided the voice of Alpha Control in the 2021 Netflix reboot of \"Lost in Space.\" She also starred in touring productions of \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\"",
      "In the 1950s, while appearing as a panelist on the Fred Friendly-produced game show \"Who Said That?,\" Lockhart met White House press correspondents. A self-described \"news junkie,\" she later traveled with them while they covered the 1956 presidential campaigns. When she filled in for the host of a TV talk show, she used her connections to interview President Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty. As thanks, Hagerty gave Lockhart a lifetime press pass. She used it for decades to attend White House briefings whenever she was in Washington."

      "Her family said in the statement, \"We will miss this truly remarkable woman, mom and grandmama.\"",

She later made her screen debut in MGM's version of \"A Christmas Carol\", playing the daughter of her real-life parents in the movie.",

She was the first recipient of the award, which is now no longer a category. Her award was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.",
      "The actor became a household name to American audiences when she starred as Ruth Martin, the mother in \"Lassie,\" the hit TV show featuring a beloved long-haired collie that aired from 1954 to 1973.",

You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Over the past three decades, Kenny Chesney has been one of the most celebrated singers in music. In his first book, \"Heart Life Music\" (written with journalist Holly Gleason, to be published Tuesday by William Morrow), Chesney recounts his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",

      "Grace",
      "There was a show on tv called \"Let's Make A Deal.\" People would be contestants, hoping host Monty Hall would pick them to compete for prizes. New cars, new kitchens with all the appliances, expensive watches. You had to pick.",
      "",
      "One of two things: color tvs and washer/dryer sets, or what was behind Door No. 3, knowing it could be a wheelbarrow with some grass seed, or a new car.",
      "I've always been attracted to what's behind Door No. 3. That idea of the big unknown you can't see always appealed to me. The seeker inside has chased the unknown all my life.",
      "When you're a dreamer, you can't not take Door No. 3. That mentality fuels you. Seeking inspiration, wanting to find out has risk involved. Some Door No. 3s don't work out. But Grace Potter? She's the epitome of why Door No. 3 is always better than playing it safe.",
      "\"You & Tequila\" showed up in my email in the middle of the night.",
      "I remember listening, thinking, \"Damn\u2026,\"",
      "That idea of a person you can't quit, because they're so addictive is real. You can't resist, only overdo it to the point of poisoning yourself hit me. I called Matraca Berg, asked if there was a demo with a man singing it; she had one. Hearing Tim Krekel sing it hit me even harder.",
      "We cut it really simple. That pull between what you want and knowing you shouldn't made \"You & Tequila\" burn into people.",
      "We were about done with Hemingway's Whiskey. I wanted something to make it shine. Buddy Cannon and I were talking about who might sound good; Clint Higham, my co-manager, even reached out to Irving Azoff about the Eagles, since this sounded like a classic Laurel Canyon song.",
      "Then the woman who sent me the demo asked, \"Why don't you get Grace Potter? She captures that haunted and haunting feeling.\"",
      "What makes Grace Potter, the ultimate Door No. 3, was the mystery. The hippie songwriter/rock girl.",
      "Once she was suggested, as much as it made no sense on paper, I knew she was the person we needed.",
      "I listen to a lot of music at night in the Virgin Islands. No light pollution, you can drift in the sounds. I'd been given Grace's live CD. \"Apologies\" poured out of the speakers.",
      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:14:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",
      "\"You say someone needs to tell you it's okay to be you. Who was that person for you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",

    "summary": "He's one of country music's most celebrated singers. But Kenny Chesney's latest work is a book, \"Heart Life Music,\" in which he describes his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
    "story": [
      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church! I woke up one day, and I went, I'm back.\"",
      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",
      "On stage with him this night was Grace Potter, the singer-songwriter he recruited for a duet, even though country really wasn't her thing. The two are now lifelong friends.",
      "\"There's people who have always seen him as just the iconic, you know, Statue of David of country music,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm gonna go to Florence and stand beside it!\" he laughed.",
      "\"But there's just so much more underneath it that's more interesting than the sculpture itself,\" Potter added.",
      "Indeed, the off-stage Kenny Chesney is a more complicated guy, a more thoughtful guy, even a little shy if you can believe it. That's the East Tennessee part that will always remain even as he's chasing sunsets.",
      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and appeared to blame stress. Doctors say stress isn't usually a direct cause, but can influence risk factors.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",
      "\"If somebody is very worried or has a lot of risk factors, that's something that we can do for them,\" he said, adding he hopes Kardashian's news helps bring awareness.",
      "\"I don't want to scare people unnecessarily, but anything that we can use to put more of a focus on women's health and on how stroke can hurt women or cause disability, I think is something that we can make more positive,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:53:28 -0400",
    "summary": "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Misty Copeland reflects on her decision to step away from the American Ballet Theatre.",
    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old. And I still to this day can't believe I've been able to live it out the way that I have.\"",
      "Copeland said the timing of her departure was important.",
      "\"I always said to myself, like, I'm not gonna be that ballerina that they're pulling off by the pointe shoes, like, 'Girl, it's time.' You know, that I wanna be able to say, you know, like, I feel good in this moment, and now is time for me to bow,\" she said.",

Seeing young and old and Black and brown and everything in between step into the theater because they felt that they could be in there, they were represented.

    "summary": "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said.",
    "story": [
      "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.",
      "\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.",
      "\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",
      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:14:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Most federal workers are entitled to back pay when the shutdown ends, but there are some exceptions.",
    "story": [
      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not eligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.",

      "After several years of losing money on cattle, Burleen and Pete Wobeter thought this would finally be the year things turned around. Their Iowa farm also grows corn and soybeans \u2014 crops that have been hit hard by the trade war with China \u2014 but cattle had been a bright spot so far in 2025.",
      "\"This year, it is the one thing that is going to make any money for us,\" Burleen said.",

      "His words sent wholesale cattle prices plummeting.",
      "\"I thought the whole point of tariffs was to bring production back home, and now he is trying to do something to destroy that production,\" Burleen said, adding, \" It feels like being a pawn in a game we're not going to win.\"",
      "\"We're being used and abused as producers,\" Pete added.",
      "For farmers across the U.S., this harvest season brought a new kind of uncertainty. China, once the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, cut off purchases after tariffs escalated, leaving producers with full silos and falling prices.",
      "The Wobeters were hoping stronger cattle prices could make up for those losses.",
      "But while cattle ranchers are earning less, shoppers aren't seeing any savings. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data. Economists say the spike is tied to drought, high feed costs and a shrinking U.S. cattle herd \u2014 now at its lowest level in decades.",
      "Bryan Whaley, CEO of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, said more imports from Argentina won't fix that.",
      "\"You have to look at the total supply chain,\" Whaley said. \"It really only is gonna be about 2.5% of our total beef supply. So it's really not going to make a substantial difference.\"",

That potential aid package is on the back burner due to the shutdown, and is separate from the $3 billion in new assistance, a senior administration official said.",
      "At the same time, the administration recently hinted that new trade agreements could also help turn things around for soybean farmers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that new deals, including one with China, would be positive for U.S. agriculture.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-beef-coffee-bananas-food-prices-cpi/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:39:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford a billion dollars \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story  stated that Ford would have a $2 billion tariff bill, amounting to 20%  of the company's global profits. Due to  recent changes to the Trump administration's  tariff program, including an extension to an offset program for  imported parts on domestically-assembled automobiles, Ford now estimates  that tariffs will cost the company $1 billion.",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The USDA notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through SNAP.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",
      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Gina Plata-Ni\u00f1o, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the situation is a \"man-made disaster that could be easily avoided regardless of what is going on in the shutdown.\"",
      "\"These are individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 veterans, older adults, people with disabilities \u2014 who are counting on this fund,\" Plata-Ni\u00f1o said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-decision-october-29-forecast/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision on Wednesday, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut on Wednesday.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday, according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in below economists' forecasts as the impact of President Trump's tariffs remain muted.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet had forecast CPI rose at a 3.1% annual clip last month. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "While most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the government shutdown, the Department of Labor is\u00a0making an exception\u00a0for the September CPI data. That's because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "The September CPI report could be the last inflation data economists see for a while. The Labor Department is unlikely to release inflation figures next month because of difficulty collecting data during the shutdown, the Trump administration said Friday in an email.",
      "What economists say",
      "Inflation is inching higher partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, according to economists. U.S. businesses are eating some of the costs in the form of lower profits, which has blunted the impact of the import duties on consumers.",
      "Still, companies are also passing on\u00a0as much as 55%\u00a0of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. Other research shows a lower rate of passthrough tariff costs to shoppers.",
      "\"Tariffs have put upward pressure on prices, particularly in the goods-producing sector of the economy,\" Brandon Zureick, senior managing director and chief economist at investment firm Johnson Investment Counsel, told CBS News. \"We're definitely a little higher than where we started the year, and above the Fed's target\" of 2% annual inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a tool for protecting U.S. manufacturing, as well as to convince businesses to reshore their factories within the country, and for generating billions of new federal revenue.",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and set the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking interest rates. Higher borrowing costs can temper inflation because it makes loans and credit cards more expensive, which can cause consumers and businesses to pare spending.",
      "What does the CPI mean for interest rates?",
      "The recent rise in inflation is complicating the Fed's decision on interest rates, with the central bank scheduled to make its next rate decision on Oct. 29. But today's inflation data could provide additional support for another cut, analysts said Friday.",
      "\"There was little in today's benign CPI report to 'spook' the Fed and we continue to expect further easing at next week's Fed meeting,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Friday email. \"A December rate cut also remains likely with the current data drought providing the Fed with little reason to deviate from the path set out in the dot plot.\"",
      "Still, inflation is edging higher, which could be an argument for keeping rates steady. But at the same time, the job market is experiencing a\u00a0sharp slowdown in hiring, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited last month when the central bank made its first rate cut of 2025. Lower borrowing costs can help support the job market by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, encouraging them to expand and hire.",
      "That means the combination of rising inflation and weakening job growt is putting the Fed's dual mandate \u2014 to keep both inflation and unemployment low \u2014 in conflict. Powell said earlier this month that the risks posed by the labor market may be outweighing concerns about rising inflation.",
      "\"The Fed has recognized the trends in the labor market as changing their directives,\" Zureick said. \"We've been dangerously close to a zero level of job growth for a few months.\"",
      "Given the Fed's focus on the labor market risks, the higher CPI rate isn't likely to derail expectations for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next meeting later this month, economists say.",
      "The probability of a 0.25-percentage point cut at the Fed's Oct. 29 meeting is pegged at 98.9%, according to CME FedWatch.",

    "story": [
      "German businessman Alexander B\u00f6cker was reading the news with his wife last Sunday when she told him about a robbery at the Louvre in Paris.",
      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",
      "\"We bought the picture, and then we had to decide: Shall we do it or not? And I said, 'Well, I hope everybody gets our sense of humor.' You know, normally, the Germans are not very famous for having a sense of humor,\" B\u00f6cker said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-cola-2026-increase-cost-of-living-adjustment-inflation/",
    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:43:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment is aimed at helping the program's 75 million beneficiaries keep pace with inflation.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday announced a 2.8%\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, an increase that will automatically boost monthly payments for the program's roughly 71 million beneficiaries starting early next year.",
      "The increase represents an uptick from the last year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, which set the 2025 increase at 2.5%. Inflation has edged higher this year. The Labor Department said Friday that the Consumer Price Index, a closely watched gauge of U.S. inflation, rose at an annual rate of 3% in September.",
      "Next year's COLA increase will boost the average Social Security payment by about $56 to an average monthly benefit of $2,071, starting in January, the Social Security Administration said. People who receive Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income and disabled people, will see their first COLA increase with their Dec. 31, 2025 check, the agency said.",
      "The annual COLA is designed to ensure that seniors, disabled Americans and other Social Security beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power to inflation. Even so, a recent poll by the AARP, an advocacy group for older Americans, found that many seniors think the retirement program's inflation adjustments are falling short and that they need an annual COLA of about 5% to keep up with their daily expenses.",
      "\"The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security is one of the few inflation-adjusted programs for retirees,\" Jenn Jones, AARP's vice president of government affairs, told CBS News. \"It is incredibly important to millions of Americans, and so although it may not feel like it's quite enough, especially after the last few years, it's critically helpful for keeping pace with rising costs.\"",
      "In a statement, Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said the cost-of-living adjustment \"is one way we are working to make sure benefits reflect today's economic realities and continue to provide a foundation of security.\"",
      "How SSA calculates its annual COLA",
      "The Social Security Administration announces the COLA each fall based on a metric known as the \"Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,\" or\u00a0CPI-W, which tracks the average change in prices paid by workers for a basket of commonly bought goods and services.",
      "The COLA is based on that inflation data from July through September.",
      "Some advocates for older Americans say the CPI-W fails to accurately reflect seniors' financial needs because it tracks younger workers, while retirees tend to face higher costs for health care, housing and some other items. Seniors on Medicare, the health insurance program for those over 65, spend 13.6% of their income on health-related expenses, more than double that of younger people, according to KFF.",
      "Meanwhile, poverty is on the rise among America's seniors, with the poverty rate among seniors rising to 15% last year, up from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to recent Census data. The AARP said more older adults are struggling with the rising cost of housing and utility costs.",
      "\"Most Social Security beneficiaries aren't working \u2014 you are on a fixed income, so any inflation increase you feel,\" Jones said. \"If the increases continue, it becomes difficult to figure out how you're going to pay for all of your monthly expenses.\"",
      "How Medicare costs could impact benefits",
      "Advocates for senior citizens say the COLA is likely to fall short, especially given forecasts for increases in Medicare's premiums and deductibles for 2026. The Medicare premium is taken directly from seniors' Social Security checks.",
      "While Medicare hasn't yet announced its 2026 premiums, its trustees report issued earlier this year projected that the standard monthly premium for Part B \u2014 which covers doctors visits and outpatient care \u2014 would likely rise to $206.50, or a 12% boost from its current rate. Deductibles are also projected to rise about 12% next year, the report said.",
      "The result: Seniors could see most of their 2026 COLA eaten up by higher Medicare costs, the National Council on Aging said in a statement.",
      "\"COLA might reflect the inflation rate, but it is woefully insufficient for older Americans who already have high health care costs and are facing even greater increases in their Medicare costs in 2026,\" Ramsey Alwin, CEO of the NCA, said in the statement.",
      "Seniors are likely to be disappointed by the 2026 COLA, which represents the second-smallest bump since 2021. Many are at risk of falling behind, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group.",
      "The Consumer Price Index for September, also released on Friday, showed that medical and elderly care costs are surpassing the 3% annualized pace of inflation. Costs for caring for the elderly at home jumped 11.6% last month on an annual basis, while medical services rose 3.9%.",
      "\"Seniors on fixed incomes are rightly concerned that the Social Security COLA is not keeping pace with the true impact of inflation on their living costs, especially in areas where prices are soaring.\u00a0 Medical, housing and grocery costs are outstripping the COLA,\" Max Richtman, the group's CEO, said in a statement.",

The index has recovered slightly after dipping to a three-year low in April, but still remains below its January level over deepening concerns about vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy, experts note.",
      "\"The lower to median end of the income spectrum are increasingly concerned about job prospects and income prospects, and that is weighing on their morale at a time where prices are rising,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS News prior to the index's release. \"So it's really an affordability issue.\"",

      "Jill Hornick, a 59-year-old service representative at a Social Security Administration field office in Illinois, would normally have received her latest paycheck on Friday. Instead, she was last paid on Oct. 10 \u2014 for three days less than she had worked.",
      "Hornick is defined as an essential worker and continues to report to the office on a daily basis during the government shutdown. She said she doesn't have time to search for a second job and isn't eligible for unemployment benefits. Because of the stalemate in Congress, now in its 24th day, Hornick also has no clue on when the next paycheck will arrive.",
      "\"It's very annoying that employees who are furloughed can collect unemployment, but employees who are essential and have to work without pay cannot collect unemployment,\" Hornick told CBS News. \"And yet I am showing up on my own dime because we still have to pay money to put gas in the car, pay the daycare center, because they are not going to take kids for free.\"",
      "While roughly 670,000 federal employees are furloughed, approximately 730,000 other government employees deemed essential \u2014 such as air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers\u00a0\u2014 continue to work without pay during the shutdown, according to estimates from the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "Hornick, whose annual income is about $75,000 a year, is now scrambling to stay afloat. That means paring her spending and contacting her mortgage lender and other creditors to ask for lenience.",
      "\"I got a letter from mortgage company saying I was approved for deferred payment and that they wouldn't take foreclosure action against me,\" she said, although she remains anxious about what the future will bring.",

      "\"It's something we were considering anyway with the economy going the way it is, but it's much more urgent now. It's important to hunker down,\" apGovannon said.",
      "Asked if he would consider leaving the federal government for the private sector, apGovannon, who has been in his current role since 2019, said he is \"in it for the long haul.\" But he can appreciate why some colleagues might want to leave government service.",
      "\"lt's hard to say to younger people, 'Hey, come work for us \u2014 you never know if you're going to be fired or not.'\" apGovannon told CBS News. \"Their perception is that government work, which was once safe, no longer is.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",

      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said in an email note that the administration is legally required to use contingency funds to pay for November SNAP benefits.",
      "\"It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,\" she said.",
      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, according to Plata-Nino.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:34:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",
      "\"As inventories deplete, trade routes narrow and margins continue to shrink, firms may be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers,\" she wrote. \"As such, upside risks remain. If pricing pressures spill over into services, it could signal a broader and more persistent inflationary trend.\"",

      "The country's mounting debt comes as the government remains closed, disrupting the economy as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.",
      "Government shutdowns can boost the national debt because they delay economic activity and postpone fiscal decisions, while pausing federal programs and starting them up again can also increase costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity.",
      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",
      "\"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000,\" he added.",
      "The federal deficit is the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue, while the debt is the total amount it owes over time.",
      "The U.S. debt reached $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government.",
      "Interest payments on the nation's debt are forecast to rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors, the Peterson Foundation said.",
      "Rising U.S. debt could also undermine investor confidence in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a report\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Credit rating agency Moody's\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.",
      "\"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched,\" she said in a statement. \"Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted \u2014 and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:10:49 -0400",
    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-benefits-90-percent-americans-will-claim-before-70/",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:15:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot: Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Trump meets Japan's new, first female prime minister, and they sign a bilateral trade deal before going together to greet troops on the USS George Washington.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he focuses on cementing deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia.",
      "The deal \u2014 which the two countries agreed to over the summer \u2014 will see\u00a0the U.S. charge\u00a015% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan has pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It's not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go.",
      "Mr. Trump and Takaichi, who became Japan's first ever female prime minister just last week, also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries including Australia\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine in recent months, as China imposes new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology, as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington.",
      "During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as \"very fair.\"",
      "\"We're going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before,\" he said, calling Japan an \"ally at the strongest level.\"",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to\u00a0federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",
      "More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year \u2014 or $52.3 billion \u2014 were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to\u00a0federal data.",
      "The American and Japanese leaders, whose countries share a rivalry with China, also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S.",
      "During their meeting, which was held at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the bilateral relationship the \"greatest alliance in the world\" and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a \"shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"",
      "It was the first meeting for Mr. Trump with Takaichi, a staunch conservative who took office last week. She was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump's up until his assassination in 2022.",
      "\"He was a great friend of mine and a great friend of yours,\" the U.S. president said as he shook Takaichi's hand on Tuesday. Their meeting came within hours of a court hearing in Tokyo during which Abe's assassin pleaded guilty to murdering the former premier with a homemade gun.",
      "In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country. After an exciting, 18-inning contest, Los Angeles pulled ahead for a 6-5 victory.",
      "Trump, Takaichi visit troops on the USS George Washington",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump touched down by helicopter with Takaichi aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at the Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo, and they saluted service members before the prime minister and president delivered remarks to the troops.",
      "Mr. Trump was heard praising Takaichi, predicting that she would \"go down as one of the great prime ministers.\"",
      "The Japanese leader was first to step to a lectern on the massive ship to speak to the gathered troops. She thanked the U.S. forces in Japan for their dedication to peace in the region, and mentioned that six years ago in the same city, Mr. Trump and her predecessor, the late Abe, together and \"demonstrated resolve that Japan and the United States will join hands to ensure peace and security.\"",
      "She said she had a renewed determination to \"carry forward that result\" and make the Indo-Pacific free and open.",
      "\"Now we are facing an unprecedented security environment,\" said Takaichi. \"Peace cannot be preserved\" by conflict alone, she added. \"It can be protected only when there is an unwavering determination and action.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump took the podium, he heaped praise on the U.S. forces gathered before him, as well as the strength of the U.S. military. As the U.S. federal government shutdown neared the one-month mark, Mr. Trump said all the troops present would receive full pay for their deployment.",
      "He brought up immigration and the controversial deployment of U.S. National Guard forces to American cities, saying: \"We need safe cities \u2014 whether people like it or not, it's what we're doing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned the U.S.\u00a0strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, saying each boat had enough drugs to kill 25,000 people and asserting that the attacks had \"stopped almost completely the drugs coming in by sea, and now we'll stop the drugs coming in by land.\"",
      "Following his appearance on the ship, President Trump was to fly back to Tokyo to attend a business leadership reception on Tuesday evening.",
      "On Monday, the president met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo's imperial palace.",
      "Trump to visit South Korea next \u2014 and meet with China's Xi Jinping",
      "South Korea is the next and final stop on the president's trip, which started over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \u2014 a visit marked by trade frameworks between the U.S. and Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn't expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they're close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government announced a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump predicted the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China \u2014 for a total rate of 140% \u2014 starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against new export restrictions imposed by Beijing.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump also said he would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, although there are no such plans for a meeting.",

    "story": [
      "A judge ruled Monday that the 22-year-old Utah man charged in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk will be allowed to wear regular clothes at all pretrial hearings but must be physically restrained due to security concerns.",
      "Attorneys for Tyler Robinson argued that images of him shackled and in jail clothing would spread widely in a case with extensive press coverage and public interest, which they said could prejudice future potential jurors.",
      "Judge Tony Graf approved limited measures to protect Robinson's presumption of innocence before a trial, agreeing that the case has drawn \"extraordinary\" public and media attention.",
      "\"Mr. Robinson shall be dressed as one who is presumed innocent,\" Graf said during a virtual court hearing on Monday.",
      "Kirk, who was 31, was assassinated on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate.",
      "Robinson was charged last month with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering and committing a violent offense in the presence of a child. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray has said they will plan to seek the death penalty.",
      "While Robinson has no prior criminal history, Judge Graf said Monday that the charges he faces are extremely serious and present safety concerns in the courtroom. It's the court's highest priority to protect the attorneys, court staff and Robinson himself during what could be emotional hearings, Graf said before denying Robinson's request to appear without restraints. He did, however, prohibit members of the media from photographing or filming Robinson's restraints.",
      "Robinson was arrested on Sept. 12 when he showed up with his parents to turn himself in at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from Orem. He is being held at the Utah County Jail without bail and hasn't yet entered a plea.",
      "As law enforcement agencies were scouring the state for the shooter last month, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said he received a phone call from a retired deputy saying he knew who killed Kirk.",
      "\"He said, 'Hey, I know who Charlie Kirk's shooter is. I know the family through religious association and he's in Washington County now, and we're working on trying to get him to come in voluntarily,'\" Brooksby said at the time.",
      "\"He didn't want a big SWAT team hitting his parents' house or his apartment. He was truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement,\" Brooksby said. \"So the conditions were as relaxed and comfortable and almost to the point of inviting. And if at the end of the day we accomplish him surrendering peacefully on his own, I'm going to make some concessions to make that happen.\"",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources previously confirmed to CBS News that\u00a0Robinson's father saw the photos\u00a0released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said.",
      "Authorities said Robinson had allegedly\u00a0confessed to the killing in text exchanges with his roommate.

    "summary": "President Trump recently said a \"patriot,\" reported by the New York Times to be Timothy Mellon, donated $130 million in an effort to keep troops paid during the shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, President Trump announced an anonymous \"patriot\" had given a donation of $130 million\u00a0 \u2014 money the president said was to be used to help pay troops during the government shutdown.",
      "There are questions about the legality of a donation of this sort (the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding congressional appropriations or accepting voluntary services). Over the weekend, The New York Times identified the anonymous donor as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune.",
      "Mellon, 83, emerged as one of the top Republican donors only in the past few years, giving far less in the decades before 2017.",
      "Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance researcher, told CBS News, \"Timothy Mellon was a relatively unknown political donor but his contributions have surged in recent years, putting him in the very top ranks of political contributors.\"",
      "Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income inequality and the environment. As Mellon's business career evolved, he began to express a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business. One turning point seems to be when he ran afoul of environmental regulators in Connecticut in the late 1990s over an airport he bought.",
      "He's written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some insight into his political views. Mellon wrote that a favorite quote of his came from Winston Churchill: \"Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.\"",
      "Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here are some numbers associated with Mellon:",
      "At least $197 million: How much Mellon donated to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election",
      "Mellon may be an obscure figure to the wider public, but he's well known in political circles for giving more than virtually any other donor to Mr. Trump and other Republican committees during the 2024 election cycle \u2014 at least $197 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The only person who gave more was SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "He emerged on the political scene as a megadonor relatively late in life. Over two decades, from 1996 to 2017, he gave a total of $350,000 in donations to political candidates. But in the four years between January 2020 and June 2024 he gave $227 million to federal candidates and political committees.",
      "Last year, Mellon made a $50 million donation to a Trump-affiliated super PAC, one of the largest individual contributions ever made public. That was one of several donations to the super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, totaling around $150 million. He also contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which produced Project 2025, the policy blueprint the Trump administration has relied on in overhauling the federal government.",
      "$25 million: How much Mellon gave to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign",
      "Mellon also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2024 presidential campaign. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Mr. Trump, whom he was also backing financially.",
      "But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy. Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines, and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy's campaign.",
      "$14.1 billion: The Mellon family's estimated wealth",
      "Timothy Mellon, the grandson of banker and industrialist Andrew Mellon, was estimated by Forbes to be worth about $1 billion last year, though he told Forbes in an email at the time that he was not a billionaire, writing, \"never have been, never will be.\" The estimated wealth of his family, including other branches, was estimated in 2024 by Forbes to be $14.1 billion.",
      "340: The number of trees he cut down at a Connecticut airport he bought",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he purchased an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages.",
      "$53 million: How much he donated to build a border wall in Texas",
      "In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Texas would build its own border wall and started his own private fund to build it. He made little progress \u2014 the Texas Tribune said his effort had slowed after raising a little over $1 million, and then Mellon chipped in $53 million. The private and public effort was quietly dropped earlier this year, as the GOP-led legislature defunded construction in June, and the crowdfunding link disappeared in late May, the Tribune reported. The state built about 65 miles of wall out of the 805 miles that Abbott planned, and it's riddled with gaps because many landowners do not want the border wall on their land.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is shaking up ICE's leadership, with plans to reassign as many as a dozen local leaders, as the agency faces pressure to ramp up arrests, sources told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is staging a major shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with plans to reassign senior leaders in agency offices across the country amid frustrations over current arrest and deportation levels, two sources familiar with the changes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "One U.S. official, who requested anonymity to talk about internal matters, said as many as roughly a dozen local ICE leaders could be reassigned, with some expected to be replaced by current or former officials at Customs and Border Protection, its sister Department of Homeland Security agency. Some of those ICE officials have already been informed of their reassignments, the official added.",
      "The planned shake-up at ICE would be a major leadership overhaul, affecting roughly half of the agency's 25 field offices.",
      "In most cases, the field office directors won't be demoted or fired, said two U.S. officials, who described the plan as a way to give certain ICE offices additional support.",
      "The Trump administration has increasingly turned to CBP and Border Patrol officials like Commander Gregory Bovino to expand its government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, deploying them to apprehend unauthorized immigrants far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "Operations by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in those cities \u2014 including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes \u2014 have triggered significant local backlash, with critics accusing the agents of being heavy-handed and arresting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but without criminal records.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, \"The President's entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.\"",
      "The Washington Examiner reported on the reassignments earlier Monday.",
      "Internally, U.S. officials tell CBS News, some ICE leaders have been frustrated with Border Patrol's operations in cities \u2014 and the opposition they have garnered from local residents. While the Trump administration has made anyone in the U.S. illegally who is encountered by federal officials subject to arrest, ICE says its operations have continued to primarily target immigrants who have committed crimes in addition to being in the country unlawfully.",
      "\"We're arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,\" one U.S. official told CBS News, referring to Border Patrol agents.",
      "Some inside the Trump administration, however, see Border Patrol officials as better equipped to carry out the aggressive and expansive operations needed to reach the ambitious arrest targets set by the White House.",
      "In the spring, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump's mass deportation plans, suggested on Fox News that ICE should be carrying out \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests per day. ICE officials have not met that target. While they have peaked above 2,000 on some days, arrests by the agency typically hover over 1,000 each day.",
      "As of this week, ICE had carried out more than 260,000 arrests under the second Trump administration, or an average of approximately 900 per day, according to internal agency data obtained by CBS News.",
      "In less than a year, the Trump administration has shuffled ICE's leadership several times.",
      "Caleb Vitello, the first official tapped to lead ICE under the second Trump administration, was reassigned in February and replaced by longtime agency veteran Todd Lyons, who continues to serve as acting director. Previous heads of ICE's deportation unit, Enforcement and Removal Operations, and its investigative branch, Homeland Security Investigations, have also been replaced in recent months.",
      "ICE has not had a Senate-confirmed director since early 2017, under the Obama administration.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reproductive-health-trump-administration-hhs-cuts/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:13:56 -0400",
    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.\"",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a network of more than 50 clinic sites serving tens of thousands of patients each year. The organization has begun drawing down its limited reserves to stay open.",
      "\"Some partners haven't been paid since summer,\" Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said. \"We're delaying lab payments and cutting back appointments. The people hit hardest are rural, low-income, and uninsured.\"",
      "Thomas said the disruptions are already visible in patient access: reduced hours at partner clinics, longer wait times for birth control refills, and a halt to some preventive screenings.",
      "\"When a clinic can't process labs or stock Depo-Provera, people simply stop coming,\" she said. \"In rural areas, there is no backup plan.\"",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",
      "Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA's staffing, but without administrators in place, money can't reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access.",
      "\"This isn't a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It's women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 16:09:52 -0400",
    "summary": "A nationwide string of threats and violent acts present a problem experts say is politically more complex than it seems.",
    "story": [
      "It's a bipartisan problem in a country beset by polarization: Since the start of 2025, political violence has killed, injured or threatened conservative and liberal political figures alike.",
      "This month, a pardoned Capitol rioter was arrested for allegedly threatening to \"eliminate\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at an event in New York City, and a Minnesota man was charged with offering a $45,000 bounty for Attorney General Pam Bondi, the latest in a jarring trend of threats and violent acts against political figures.",
      "In September, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on a Utah college campus. Afterwards, the alleged shooter told his roommate, \"some hate can't be negotiated out,\" according to court documents.",
      "Three months earlier in Minnesota, Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed at home, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were shot on the same night. Two months before that, Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's home was set on fire while he and his family slept.",
      "Also this year: Two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in D.C. were fatally shot, a Republican Party of New Mexico office was targeted in an arson attack, two Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities were shot at and a California fertility clinic was bombed, among other violent incidents.",
      "And before that, President Trump survived two attempts on his life and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was beaten with a hammer at home. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's would-be assassin walked in front of his home, but then had second thoughts, called an emergency line and admitted traveling to Maryland to kill a Supreme Court justice.",
      "The trend has drawn a divided response. Mr. Trump and his allies have accused the \"radical left\" of fomenting violence, while Democrats argue that right-wing extremism is a problem, too.",
      "But while some of these perpetrators may have claimed political rationales for their violent acts, it's hard to argue any of them were adherents to a cohesive political cause. They were mostly lone actors driven by personal gripes, researchers who study political violence say \u2014 so some experts suggest the frame of partisan politics may not be the best way of understanding the problem.",
      "\"The rush to assign blame to the traditional binary of left versus right politically, I think, is an exercise in futility,\" said Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, \"because it's much more complicated than that a lot of times.\"",
      "\"Salad bar extremism\"",
      "There's some research on the political motives of violent acts. One report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found right-wing terrorism has been more common than left-wing terrorism in the U.S. over the last decade, but this year, left-wing incidents are on track to take the lead for the first time in over 30 years.",
      "It's difficult to draw sweeping conclusions from this report because the total number of acts of terrorism has dropped. From 2016 through last year, there were an average of 22.7 attacks and plots from the right and four from the left annually, while in the first half of this year, there were five left-wing incidents and just one on the right.",
      "Many people who carry out political violence have views that are tough to pin down, or they hold a mix of beliefs that don't align with either side of the partisan divide.",
      "Take the bombing at a Southern California fertility clinic that injured four people in May.\u00a0 Authorities say the perpetrator \u2014 who died in the attack \u2014 appeared to believe in \"anti-natalism\" and \"pro-mortalism,\" a set of obscure philosophies that argue it's wrong to bring children into the world against their will, or that view death as preferable to life.",
      "\"Not only are the people carrying out this violence not stooges of a political party or affiliated with the political parties, they're not really affiliated with the mainstream political ideologies that either espouses,\" said Kieran Doyle, North America research manager at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, which tracks political violence globally.",
      "Some violent actors hold \"a hodgepodge of different, sometimes apparently contradictory, political motivations,\" said Doyle, who called that phenomenon \"salad bar extremism.\"",
      "In some cases, the perpetrators' motives are hazy. Baumgartner pointed to Thomas Matthew Crooks, who shot at Mr. Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania last year, grazing the then-presidential candidate's ear and killing a rallygoer before he was fatally shot by the Secret Service. The 20-year-old's motives and political leanings are shrouded in mystery \u2014 he searched online for information about both Mr. Trump and former President Joe Biden, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News last year.",
      "And in other cases, perpetrators of violence have no obvious ideology at all.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel testified earlier this month that a large share of the bureau's domestic terror probes are focused on a category called \"nihilistic violent extremism,\" which he defined as violent acts that are \"motivated by a deep hatred of society.\"",
      "\"The reasons why they're carrying out these attacks are not inherently political,\" Baumgartner said of nihilistic extremists, which he said includes some recent school shooters in Nashville and Minneapolis. \"They are not doing it to further some political, religious, ethnonationalist \u2026 cause. They're just doing it for the sake of committing an act of violence.\"",
      "Violence dominated by lone wolves with personalized motives",
      "Perpetrators of violence also rarely belong to organized groups with clear goals and motives,\u00a0 experts say.",
      "Cionadh Raleigh, CEO of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, told CBS News that violent acts by groups like far-right militias are on a long-term decline. \"There are many groups, but they're very inactive,\" she said.",
      "But killings or assassinations by lone actors \"have been consistently high in the States now for decades,\" said Raleigh.",
      "Baumgartner said the only recent high-profile act of political violence with an obvious link to a wider group was the July shooting at an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas. More than a dozen people have been arrested in connection with that shooting, and authorities say many of the defendants harbored anarchist views or beliefs in line with antifa, a loosely defined left-wing movement.

      "But in general, Baumgartner said, political violence is \"primarily conducted by individuals who have a highly personalized and individualized ideology, if you can call it that.\"",
      "In some cases, these lone actors are \"deeply immersed in niche online subcultures\" and have grown alienated from society for various reasons, he said. He argues that profile fits the Trump rally shooter Crooks, alleged Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson and Dallas ICE shooter Joshua Jahn.",

      "Political threats on the rise",

      "The U.S. Capitol Police is on track to investigate over 14,000 possible threats against lawmakers and their offices this year, Chief Michael Sullivan said last month, up from 9,474 in an already busy 2024.

      "Roudabeh Kishi, the initiative's chief research officer, said local officials \"across the spectrum\" have faced threats and violence \u2014 including those who hold nonpartisan offices.",
      "She believes politicians hold some responsibility to cool hostilities \u2014 including by avoiding baselessly casting blame.",

    "summary": "Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha say they'll defy federal orders regarding Trump's immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Chicago \u2014 Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump's controversial immigration enforcement mission \u2014 a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks.",
      "\"It's disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois's 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\"",
      "Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops \u2013 including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard \u2013 to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.",
      "\"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who's actively dismantling our rights \u2014 free speech, due process, freedom of the press \u2014 it's really hard to be a soldier right now.\"",
      "Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment.",
      "Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\"",
      "Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn't hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\"",
      "\"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn't stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\"",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter.",
      "The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They're definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said.",
      "Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation's wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We're not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\"",
      "The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders \u2014 too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They're not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don't want to be there. They're scared, too.\"",
      "Fears for immigrant service members",
      "Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard \u2013 with 160 legal permanent residents in the state's Army National Guard and 30 in the state's Air National Guard.",
      "\"They're in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They're choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything \u2014 their legal status, their path to citizenship.\"",
      "U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs.",
      "Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo.",
      "\"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\"",
      "\"Everyone says, 'Why don't they do it the right way?'\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said.",
      "Retribution in their ranks",
      "Both Blaha and Palecek said they've faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\"",
      "Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She's received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said.",
      "Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said.",
      "\"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\"",
      "Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I've been truly proud of what I've been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I'm in the military. It's embarrassing.\"",
      "Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It's a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it's OK.\"",
      "A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide.",
      "A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago's violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita.",
      "When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\"",
      "\"They're coming after communities that have built this country,\" Palecek added. \"To be used against my culture, my community, my neighbors \u2014 that's vile and disgusting to me.\"",
      "The two soldiers say they're speaking out to warn the rest of the country. \"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else,\" Blaha said. \"We need to combat the misinformation and stand up to Donald Trump. Crime is down. This is not about safety \u2014 it's about control.\"",

      "Indiana's Republican governor on Monday said he would be calling a special session to consider redrawing the state's congressional map, following in the footsteps of other GOP states \u2014 although the state Senate president cautioned that \"the votes still aren't there.\"",
      "Gov. Mike Braun posted on X that he will be \"calling a special legislative session to protect Hoosiers from efforts in other states that seek to diminish their voice in Washington and ensure their representation in Congress is fair.\" He said the special session will work to conform \"Indiana's tax code with new federal tax provisions.\"",
      "The session is set to start on Nov. 3 and by law it can only run for 30 session days, or 40 calendar days. Indiana currently has seven Republicans and two Democrats in Congress, and the Republicans are hoping to change the district lines to edge out the two Democrats.",
      "Filing for the 2026 midterm elections begins on Jan. 7 and closes on Feb. 6, with the primaries scheduled for May 5 \u2014 which would give candidates only a few months to campaign under new district lines.",
      "Republicans have a supermajority in both chambers, but Indiana Senate President Rodric Bray's office said in a statement Monday morning that \"the votes still aren't there for redistricting.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder said in a statement that Democrats will fight the \"illegitimate session with every tool, every vote and every ounce of moral clarity we have.\"",
      "President Trump won Indiana by 19 points, but there has been hesitation from Republican lawmakers on redrawing the state's congressional lines, which were set in 2021. Republican leaders have met with Mr. Trump at the White House, and Vice President JD Vance has visited Indiana at least twice and also met with Republican lawmakers in D.C.",
      "Republicans have been seeking to redistrict in red states nationwide as Mr. Trump has tried to solidify the GOP majority in the House. Over the summer, Mr. Trump called on Texas Republicans to redraw their congressional maps to give the party up to five seats. That push garnered national attention, especially when Democrats in the state legislature fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum, dragging the issue into a second session until it eventually succeeded.",
      "In response, California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, pushed an effort to redraw his state's congressional districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats. A new map was passed by the Democratic-controlled Assembly, and it now will go before voters on Nov. 4 as a ballot measure known as Proposition 50. A CBS News poll conducted between Oct. 16 and 21 found that 62% of California voters plan to support it.",
      "Other Republican-led states have taken on redistricting efforts, even though the net outcome would just be one seat in each state. Missouri lawmakers approved a new map in September to edge out longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver in Kansas City, and North Carolina followed earlier this month with the General Assembly passing a map intended to force out Rep. Don Davis.",

      "Congress failed to reach a funding deal by the Wednesday, Oct. 1, deadline, leading to a government shutdown that will force active-duty service members to continue to serve without pay until a deal is made.",
      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:03:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Gina Plata-Ni\u00f1o, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the situation is a \"man-made disaster that could be easily avoided regardless of what is going on in the shutdown.\"",
      "\"These are individuals who are living paycheck to paycheck \u2014 veterans, older adults, people with disabilities \u2014 who are counting on this fund,\" Plata-Ni\u00f1o said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut accused Republicans and President Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.",
      "\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/argentina-election-results-javier-milei-trump-backed-party-wins/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:44:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei declares himself \"king of a lost world\" after midterms victory aided by massive bailout by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment \u2014 with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration.",
      "In the election widely seen as a referendum on self-described \"anarcho-capitalist\" Milei's past two years in office, which have included corruption scandals and the scrapping of tens of thousands of public jobs, his right-wing La Libertad Avanza party won more than 40% of the votes, compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections.",
      "Milei, a key ideological ally of President Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, three seats short of a congressional majority.",
      "\"I am the king of a lost world,\" Milei exulted as his supporters cheered in downtown Buenos Aires on Sunday. \"Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.\"",
      "An Argentine legislative election has likely rarely generated so much interest in Washington, or on Wall Street.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank, and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks, on a good showing for Milei in the national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory.",
      "\"If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Mr. Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month.",
      "Those comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms, and analysts predicted a tight midterm race.",
      "To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Then, in an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the international credit line.",
      "In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday.",
      "\"For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,\" Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage, told The Associated Press. \"It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023.\"",
      "The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the political outsider inherited in late 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump, during a flight to Japan on Monday, said on his Truth Social network that Milei was \"doing a wonderful job.\"",
      "\"Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Milei responded to the post, calling the U.S. president \"a great friend\" of Argentina and thanking him for \"trusting the Argentine people.\"",
      "Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Mr. Trump for his role in helping Milei at the polls.",
      "Kicillof  warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy.",
      "\"I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,\" he said. \"If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.\"",
      "Sunday's outcome will test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although his budget cuts have slashed inflation \u2014 from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month \u2014 consumer price increases still outpace salaries and pensions.",
      "The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before.",
      "In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.",
      "But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifan\u00eda Contreras, 64, told the AP that she as though she was bearing the brunt of the federal budget cuts.",
      "\"You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,\" she said, describing how her monthly pension, worth about $200, has shriveled in value as a result of austerity measures. \"The situation is getting worse and worse.\"",
      "More than 250,000 jobs have been lost since Milei came to power, with around 18,000 businesses closing, according to an analysis published this month by the Center for Argentine Political Economy think tank, as the right-wing administration froze investment in infrastructure, health care, education and other social services.",
      "Voting is compulsory for adults in Argentina, but electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% on Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's return to democracy in 1983.",
      "\"I vote out of obligation, nothing more,\" Mat\u00edas Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate, told the AP. \"None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil.\"",

    "story": [
      "Air traffic controller Jack Criss is now clearing takeoffs and takeout orders. The single dad took on a side gig as a DoorDash delivery driver during the second-longest government shutdown in modern history in order to make some extra cash and cover his daughter's high school tuition.",
      "For the past few weeks, air traffic controllers have been receiving partial pay \u2013 but next week, they're expected to miss their first full paychecks as the funding lapse continues.",
      "\"It's been incredibly difficult. You can feel the tension, and it's heavy\u2026and it hurts,\" Criss said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Saturday Mornings.\"",
      "As the government shutdown rolls into Day 25, Congress remains unable to strike a deal. The Senate failed to advance measuresThursday that would pay federal employees like Criss.",
      "\"It is hard enough just going to work. Now, when you add\u2026not getting paid, that's when you just like multiply the level of pressure. And you know, air traffic is a safety sensitive position,\" Criss said. \"The margin of error is zero. So if you think about it as pressure on top of pressure, when you don't know exactly when you'll get paid based on politics.\"",
      "Criss said he has tapped into his retirement funds and taken out a high-interest, short-term loan to make sure he has the cash to weather a lengthy shutdown.",
      "While Criss has continued to clock into work, the Department of Transportation reports that it's seen an uptick in sick calls from controllers, causing staffing shortages at some airports.",
      "\"Safety is paramount for us and so if we don't have the staffing levels in a tower, TRACON or center, you will see us delay traffic; you will see us cancel flights,\" U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.",
      "Duffy has discouraged air traffic controllers from taking on side hustles to focus on their already demanding positions.",
      "\"Well, I don't want my air traffic controllers to take a second job \u2014 I want them to do one job. I don't want them delivering for DoorDash, I don't want them driving Uber. I want them coming to their facilities, and controlling the air space,\" Duffy said Thursday at the House GOP's press conference, though he acknowledged the financial stress workers are facing to \"feed their kids and support their family members.\"",
      "But Criss says there's no way around it for struggling workers like himself. Even with the extra income from DoorDash he was \"not even close\" to covering his daughter's tuition bill.",
      "Criss shared his story with lawmakers at a televised town hall last week. After hearing his story, DoorDash reached out to offer the essential worker $10,000 to help pay for his daughter's education. If the money comes, Criss said it would be a huge help \u2013 but it still may not be enough to give up his new side job.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of executives and companies have donated to fund the construction of President Trump's $300 million ballroom, as many of them eye favorable policy, reduced scrutiny or approval for major deals from the White House.",
      "Donors to the ballroom \u2014 which will take the place of the White House's East Wing \u2014 include Big Tech companies, defense contractors and other large corporations. The White House has not disclosed how much money each company donated. Mr. Trump has said construction will be funded through private donations and his own money \u2014 not taxpayer funds.",
      "Speaking to reporters Friday night as he was departing for an Asia trip, Mr. Trump said that \"more than $350 million\" had been raised so far.",
      "CBS News reviewed a list of 37 donors provided by the White House, which included tech firms like Google and Amazon and crypto companies like Ripple and Coinbase. Others that contributed to the project include Nvidia, Susquehanna International Group and ExtremityCare, according to sources familiar with the matter. The president hosted a dinner last week thanking donors, although not everyone invited to the dinner contributed.",
      "Asked for comment on whether these donations present any conflicts, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote in a statement to CBS News: \"The same critics who are wrongly claiming there are conflicts of interests, would complain if taxpayers were footing the bill.\"",
      "\"The donors for the White House ballroom project represent a wide array of great American companies and generous individuals, all of whom are contributing to make the People's House better for generations to come,\" she added.",
      "Here's a closer look at what some of the donors and dinner guests stand to gain from federal policy or have already received from the administration.",
      "Big Tech and telecom",
      "Tech giants Google, Palantir, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as cell phone carrier T-Mobile, were among the donors listed by the White House.",
      "YouTube, owned by Google, agreed to pay $22 million toward the ballroom project as part of a legal settlement in a case Mr. Trump brought against the company for temporarily removing him from the platform after the 2021 Capitol riot.",
      "Software company Palantir has been awarded more than $800 million across several government contracts in fiscal year 2025, more than in any prior year, according to federal contract data. The Trump administration has also made Palantir a key player in managing and consolidating data about Americans between federal agencies, The New York Times reported.",
      "Amazon and Microsoft also have each received hundreds of millions in government contracts, federal data show.",
      "T-Mobile may stand to benefit from a Trump Organization-linked mobile phone and cell service company, something House Democrats have expressed conflict-of-interest concerns over. The company isn't run by the Trump Organization, but is licensing the president's name. The Trump Mobile network says it is run on Liberty Mobile Wireless, a mobile virtual network operator that rents bandwidth from major carriers like T-Mobile.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a T-Mobile spokesperson said the company donated to the Trust for the National Mall, which is handling ballroom donations, but has \"no role in the use of those funds or decisions related to the construction of the ballroom.\" The spokesperson did not comment on the Trump-linked cell service company.",
      "Representatives from Nvidia, one of the world's leading developers of advanced microchips, were among dozens of donors invited to Mr. Trump's thank-you dinner, according to a guest list obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration granted Nvidia export licenses to send certain chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenues, as the company's CEO presses for greater access to the Chinese market. Nvidia is also waiting for the administration's full approval to ship hundreds of thousands of its artificial intelligence chips to the United Arab Emirates annually, though the administration gave the company permission to export to American businesses operating in the Gulf country earlier this month, according to Bloomberg.",
      "Jeff Yass, who cofounded the trading firm Susquehanna International Group and invested in TikTok, was also on the guest list. Yass has given more than $16 million to super PAC MAGA Inc. this year. In his first term, Mr. Trump sought to ban TikTok, but he reversed course this year, signing an order last month to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. with a slate of American investors. Meanwhile, Yass's wealth has surged by billions of dollars this year, according to estimates by Bloomberg and Forbes.",
      "Cryptocurrency",
      "Some of the biggest names in crypto also made donations to Mr. Trump's ballroom, according to the White House's list of donors. The Trump administration has vowed to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world,\" as the president's family has made billions on their own crypto ventures.",
      "A company spokesman confirmed Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, made a donation. The company is seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval to offer blockchain-based stocks. It also faces an SEC investigation started under former President Joe Biden into whether it misstated its user numbers in past financial disclosures, The New York Times reported. Earlier this year, the SEC withdrew a separate lawsuit against Coinbase, shortly after the company donated $1 million to Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twin brothers who own crypto exchange Gemini, also helped pay for the event space. In February, the SEC closed a long-running investigation into their crypto exchange, Cameron Winklevoss announced on X, after the Winklevoss twins donated more than $2 million to MAGA Inc. one month prior. In July, the brothers successfully lobbied Mr. Trump to withdraw his original nominee to run the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates crypto, according to Politico.",
      "The crypto company Ripple also donated. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has openly expressed his support for the current administration's cryptocurrency policies, and Mr. Trump has promoted its coin, XRP, as one of the coins that a planned U.S. government-controlled crypto reserve should include.",
      "Defense and federal contractors",
      "Lockheed Martin donated over $10 million to Mr. Trump's ballroom, according to company sources. The defense contractor is typically awarded tens of billions annually in federal contracts.",
      "Booz Allen Hamilton also made a donation to the president's event space. The consulting firm typically generates 98% of its annual revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, but it has suffered from the Trump administration's crackdown on federal spending. Its government contracts shrunk by 20% in the fiscal year 2025, and its stock price has plunged 46% since Mr. Trump's reelection.",
      "Media",
      "Comcast has expressed interest in acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, Bloomberg reported, but its merger would face federal scrutiny. The Department of Justice blocked a Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger in 2015, because it would have made the conglomerate an \"unavoidable gatekeeper\" for Internet-based services. Comcast doesn't historically have the favor of the president; in April on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Comcast, which owns NBC and is spinning off MSNBC, a \"disgrace to the integrity of broadcasting.\"",
      "Medical",
      "Biotech company ExtremityCare's CEOs were on the thank-you dinner guest list. The company, which makes costly human cell and tissue medical products, previously donated $5 million to MAGA Inc. Soon after the donation, the Trump administration moved to delay a Biden administration plan to limit Medicare's coverage of the company's \"skin substitute\" bandages.",
      "CBS News has requested comment from the companies listed in this story.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department is preparing to send election observers to California and New Jersey next month, following requests from their state Republican parties.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties.",
      "The department announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The goal, according to the DOJ, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Election monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "The DOJ's efforts are also the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.",
      "The announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the department \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"",
      "Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.\"",
      "The letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the Associated Press, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.",
      "\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.",
      "The state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.",
      "Each of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.",
      "California is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.",
      "Election integrity efforts were a focus of Dhillon's California law practice before she joined the Justice Department. Her practice sued over the state's election laws in the past, including a\u00a02020 lawsuit\u00a0on behalf of the California Republican Party challenging ballot collection efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.",
      "\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.",
      "Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's election operations and said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County's elections as \"accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.\"",
      "Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.",
      "\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.",
      "Most Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks \u2014 and sometimes longer.",
      "In 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.",
      "California's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.",
      "The New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Mr. Trump's column in last year's presidential race.",
      "The county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans.",
      "In 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson \u2014 the largest city in Passaic County \u2014 after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.",
      "Platkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"",
      "Local election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.",
      "Last year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "The DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.",
      "David Becker, a CBS News election law expert and political contributor  who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.",
      "But Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors' presence.",
      "If the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials didn't want them, \"That could result in chaos,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Kingston, Jamaica \u2014 Hurricane Melissa was about\u00a0to pummel Jamaica on Tuesday as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, the strongest to lash the island since recordkeeping began 174 years ago.",
      "The storm was expected to make landfall early Tuesday and slice diagonally across the island, entering near St. Elizabeth parish in the south and exiting around St. Ann parish in the north, forecasters said.",
      "Hours before the storm, the government said it had done all it could to prepare as it warned of catastrophic damage.",
      "\"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. \"The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.\"",
      "Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were reported ahead of the storm, with officials in Jamaica cautioning that the cleanup and damage assessment would be slow.",
      "Melissa is expected to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places, the hurricane center said. \"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the center stressed.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots from Monday into Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the center added.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected today into Wednesday on the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline. Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor \"and (we) hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place.\"",
      "The storm already was blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person was missing.",
      "Melissa was centered about 135 miles southwest of Kingston and about 310 miles southwest of Guant\u00e1namo, Cuba. The system had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph, well above the minimum 157 mph needed for it to reach the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It was moving north-northeast at 2 mph, according to the hurricane center.",
      "\"We will get through it together,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service.",
      "Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps advisor based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.",
      "\"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening,\" he said. \"There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement.\"",
      "Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.",
      "\"Every drop will count,\" he said.",
      "Melissa also was expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba late Tuesday as a powerful hurricane.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guant\u00e1namo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches of rain was forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.",
      "Cuban officials said Monday that they were evacuating more than 600,000 people from the region, including Santiago, the island's second-largest city.",
      "Melissa also has drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti.",
      "The hurricane was forecast to turn northeast after Cuba and strike the southeast Bahamas by Wednesday evening.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas, and a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. State Department\u00a0issued natural disaster travel alerts for Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the Bahamas on Monday, urging U.S. citizens to consider leaving while flights were still available, or be prepared to shelter in place.",

    "summary": "The Murray cod, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth 66 million years ago, causing mass extinction.",
      "New research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike, but it's only one piece of the global picture, independent experts say.",
      "\"Dinosaurs were quite diverse and now we know there were quite distinct communities\" roaming around before being abruptly wiped out, said Daniel Peppe, a study co-author and paleontologist at Baylor University.",
      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",
      "The fossils previously found at the New Mexico site include Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops-like horned herbivore.",
      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:16:10 -0400",
    "summary": "AI companyy said the new browser is now available on Apple laptops that run on macOS and will expand to other platforms soon.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm - the strongest a hurricane can get  \u2014 is expected to bring \"catastrophic winds, flooding, and storm surge\" to Jamaica Tuesday, forecasters say.",
    "story": [
      "Melissa was inching toward Jamaica as a Category 5 hurricane early Tuesday -- the strongest a hurricane can get -- and was expected to bring \"catastrophic winds, flooding, and storm surge\" to the island before moving on to Cuba and the Bahamas, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center warned.",
      "But Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, but it's turning into the strongest Atlantic system this season.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "The storm had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph as of the NHC's latest update early Tuesday. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "Melissa's center was about 135 miles southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, and some 310 miles southwest of Guantanamo, Cuba, as of the latest hurricane center update. Hurricane-force winds extended some 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extended 195 miles. The storm was moving ever-so-slowly north-northeast at a mere 2 mph.",
      "\"On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move over Jamaica today, across southeastern Cuba Wednesday morning and across the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "\"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely before Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica later today. However, Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, and will still be at hurricane strength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas,\" the center continued.",
      "When Melissa makes landfall, peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves is forecast to reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica and 7 to 11 feet in Cuba.",
      "The storm's extremely slow pace also raises the risk of destructive impacts, particularly in Jamaica.",
      "\"The devastation is going to be so profound because the storm is moving slowly,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said. \"It's going to remain at a very slow pace as it traverses the island. ... All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica.\"",
      "Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak\u00a0explained. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, Kozak said. It killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "Hurricane advisories",
      "A hurricane warning is in effect for Jamaica and the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo and Holguin and the southeastern and central Bahamas.",
      "A hurricane watch is up for the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "A tropical storm warning is posted for Haiti, the Cuban province of Las Tunas and for the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The Naval Station Guantanamo Bay said it was moving \"non-mission-essential\" U.S. citizens off the island in groups ahead of severe weather from Melissa.",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "Melissa is expected to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places, the hurricane center said. \"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the center emphasized.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots from Monday into Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the center added.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected today into Wednesday on the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "In the southeast Bahamas, forecasters said, a total rainfall of 4 to 8 inches is expected Tuesday into Wednesday, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "\"Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica,\" forecasters said.",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major storm, according to climate scientists. That translates into stronger winds, heavier rainfall and a higher sea level rise, which would make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told The Associated Press.",

      "A judge ruled Monday that the 22-year-old Utah man charged in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk will be allowed to wear regular clothes at all pretrial hearings but must be physically restrained due to security concerns.",
      "Attorneys for Tyler Robinson argued that images of him shackled and in jail clothing would spread widely in a case with extensive press coverage and public interest, which they said could prejudice future potential jurors.",

      "\"Mr. Robinson shall be dressed as one who is presumed innocent,\" Graf said during a virtual court hearing on Monday.",
      "Kirk, who was 31, was assassinated on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate.",
      "Robinson was charged last month with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering and committing a violent offense in the presence of a child. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray has said they will plan to seek the death penalty.",
      "While Robinson has no prior criminal history, Judge Graf said Monday that the charges he faces are extremely serious and present safety concerns in the courtroom. It's the court's highest priority to protect the attorneys, court staff and Robinson himself during what could be emotional hearings, Graf said before denying Robinson's request to appear without restraints. He did, however, prohibit members of the media from photographing or filming Robinson's restraints.",
      "Robinson was arrested on Sept. 12 when he showed up with his parents to turn himself in at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from Orem. He is being held at the Utah County Jail without bail and hasn't yet entered a plea.",
      "As law enforcement agencies were scouring the state for the shooter last month, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said he received a phone call from a retired deputy saying he knew who killed Kirk.",
      "\"He said, 'Hey, I know who Charlie Kirk's shooter is. I know the family through religious association and he's in Washington County now, and we're working on trying to get him to come in voluntarily,'\" Brooksby said at the time.",
      "\"He didn't want a big SWAT team hitting his parents' house or his apartment. He was truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement,\" Brooksby said. \"So the conditions were as relaxed and comfortable and almost to the point of inviting. And if at the end of the day we accomplish him surrendering peacefully on his own, I'm going to make some concessions to make that happen.\"",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources previously confirmed to CBS News that\u00a0Robinson's father saw the photos\u00a0released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said.",
      "Authorities said Robinson had allegedly\u00a0confessed to the killing in text exchanges with his roommate. A spokesperson for Discord\u00a0also previously confirmed\u00a0to CBS News that Robinson appeared to admit to committing the shooting in messages he had posted to the social media platform.",

    "story": [
      "Last week, President Trump announced an anonymous \"patriot\" had given a donation of $130 million\u00a0 \u2014 money the president said was to be used to help pay troops during the government shutdown.",
      "There are questions about the legality of a donation of this sort (the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding congressional appropriations or accepting voluntary services). Over the weekend, The New York Times identified the anonymous donor as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune.",
      "Mellon, 83, emerged as one of the top Republican donors only in the past few years, giving far less in the decades before 2017.",
      "Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance researcher, told CBS News, \"Timothy Mellon was a relatively unknown political donor but his contributions have surged in recent years, putting him in the very top ranks of political contributors.\"",
      "Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income inequality and the environment. As Mellon's business career evolved, he began to express a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business. One turning point seems to be when he ran afoul of environmental regulators in Connecticut in the late 1990s over an airport he bought.",
      "He's written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some insight into his political views. Mellon wrote that a favorite quote of his came from Winston Churchill: \"Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.\"",
      "Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here are some numbers associated with Mellon:",
      "At least $197 million: How much Mellon donated to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election",
      "Mellon may be an obscure figure to the wider public, but he's well known in political circles for giving more than virtually any other donor to Mr. Trump and other Republican committees during the 2024 election cycle \u2014 at least $197 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The only person who gave more was SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "He emerged on the political scene as a megadonor relatively late in life. Over two decades, from 1996 to 2017, he gave a total of $350,000 in donations to political candidates. But in the four years between January 2020 and June 2024 he gave $227 million to federal candidates and political committees.",
      "Last year, Mellon made a $50 million donation to a Trump-affiliated super PAC, one of the largest individual contributions ever made public. That was one of several donations to the super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, totaling around $150 million. He also contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which produced Project 2025, the policy blueprint the Trump administration has relied on in overhauling the federal government.",
      "$25 million: How much Mellon gave to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:14:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Most federal workers are entitled to back pay when the shutdown ends, but there are some exceptions.",
    "story": [
      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The memo also contradicts previous guidance\u00a0published\u00a0in September by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states. Excepted workers are not considered unemployed and therefore are not eligible for unemployment benefits in most states, Tom Spiggle, employment attorney and founder of the Spiggle Law Firm, told CBS News.",

      "\"We're being used and abused as producers,\" Pete added.",
      "For farmers across the U.S., this harvest season brought a new kind of uncertainty. China, once the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, cut off purchases after tariffs escalated, leaving producers with full silos and falling prices.",
      "The Wobeters were hoping stronger cattle prices could make up for those losses.",
      "But while cattle ranchers are earning less, shoppers aren't seeing any savings. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data. Economists say the spike is tied to drought, high feed costs and a shrinking U.S. cattle herd \u2014 now at its lowest level in decades.",
      "Bryan Whaley, CEO of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, said more imports from Argentina won't fix that.",
      "\"You have to look at the total supply chain,\" Whaley said. \"It really only is gonna be about 2.5% of our total beef supply. So it's really not going to make a substantial difference.\"",

    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.\"",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a network of more than 50 clinic sites serving tens of thousands of patients each year. The organization has begun drawing down its limited reserves to stay open.",
      "\"Some partners haven't been paid since summer,\" Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said. \"We're delaying lab payments and cutting back appointments. The people hit hardest are rural, low-income, and uninsured.\"",
      "Thomas said the disruptions are already visible in patient access: reduced hours at partner clinics, longer wait times for birth control refills, and a halt to some preventive screenings.",
      "\"When a clinic can't process labs or stock Depo-Provera, people simply stop coming,\" she said. \"In rural areas, there is no backup plan.\"",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",
      "Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA's staffing, but without administrators in place, money can't reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access.",
      "\"This isn't a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It's women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-beef-coffee-bananas-food-prices-cpi/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha say they'll defy federal orders regarding Trump's immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Chicago \u2014 Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump's controversial immigration enforcement mission \u2014 a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks.",
      "\"It's disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois's 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\"",
      "Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops \u2013 including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard \u2013 to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.",
      "\"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who's actively dismantling our rights \u2014 free speech, due process, freedom of the press \u2014 it's really hard to be a soldier right now.\"",
      "Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment.",
      "Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\"",
      "Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn't hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\"",
      "\"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn't stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\"",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter.",
      "The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They're definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said.",
      "Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation's wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We're not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\"",
      "The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders \u2014 too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They're not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don't want to be there. They're scared, too.\"",
      "Fears for immigrant service members",
      "Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard \u2013 with 160 legal permanent residents in the state's Army National Guard and 30 in the state's Air National Guard.",
      "\"They're in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They're choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything \u2014 their legal status, their path to citizenship.\"",
      "U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs.",
      "Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo.",
      "\"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\"",
      "\"Everyone says, 'Why don't they do it the right way?'\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said.",
      "Retribution in their ranks",
      "Both Blaha and Palecek said they've faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\"",
      "Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She's received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said.",
      "Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said.",
      "\"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\"",
      "Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I've been truly proud of what I've been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I'm in the military. It's embarrassing.\"",
      "Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It's a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it's OK.\"",
      "A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide.",
      "A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago's violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita.",
      "When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\"",
      "\"They're coming after communities that have built this country,\" Palecek added. \"To be used against my culture, my community, my neighbors \u2014 that's vile and disgusting to me.\"",
      "The two soldiers say they're speaking out to warn the rest of the country. \"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else,\" Blaha said. \"We need to combat the misinformation and stand up to Donald Trump. Crime is down. This is not about safety \u2014 it's about control.\"",

    "story": [
      "A nonprofit organization in Alaska has rescued at least 180 dogs \u2014 and a turtle \u2014 after flooding devastated several remote villages in Alaska earlier this month.",
      "Hundreds of people were airlifted out of the villages\u00a0that were hit by high surf and strong winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, but many dogs had to be left behind. The villages, most on the western coast of Alaska, have no road access, which means everything needs to flown in and out, including pets.",
      "That has been the biggest challenge for Bethel Friends of Canines, or BFK9, as the organization continues rescues, said Jenna Stewart, the nonprofit's director of development. BFK9, which started as an animal rescue in 2011, is based in Bethel, Alaska, a hub for the villages in the region.",
      "\"We are thankful to have so many pilots and airlines that help us,\" Stewart said in an email. \"It is hard for people outside of Alaska, and even some in Alaska, to fathom not being able to just drive and save these dogs.\"",
      "BFK9, which typically takes in about 500 animals a year, has also gotten help from some people who stayed behind. In Kipnuk, one of the hard-hit villages, a group of teachers and others rounded up dogs to transfer to the rescuers, who arrived with airline kennels.",
      "\"The first dogs they sent in to us arrived in a plastic tote and a couple puppies in a Spiderman backpack,\" Stewart said. \"They had nothing else to hold these dogs, but knew they had to get out of the Village and to safety with BFK9.\"",
      "While nearly all the rescues are of dogs, the group also rescued its first turtle \u2014 a red-eared slider turtle that was a classroom pet in one of the villages.",
      "\"The turtle is now in Bethel with a local veterinarian,\" Stewart said.",
      "The group will take in cats as well, but there aren't many in rural Alaska, Steward said. They usually only get three to five cats a year, she said.",
      "After BFK9 gets the dogs to Bethel, they work to reunite them with their families.",
      "\"These Villages are pretty small, which means usually everyone knows everyone's dog,\" Stewart said.",
      "If a dog's owner is unknown, the group posts pictures on its Facebook page. Foster homes are also available if owners can't take their dogs right away.",
      "As of Friday, BFK9 was still getting information about more dogs that needed rescuing. \"A lot of these dogs left out there are the scared ones. They are so scared, and so confused and are hiding,\" Stewart said.",
      "\"This ordeal is far from over,\" she said.",
      "BFK9 has partnered with other groups, including the Humane World of Animals, Best Friends Animal Rescue and the August Fund in Anchorage, to help rescue and hold the dogs while they wait to be reunited.",
      "The nonprofit has received donations and support from people across Alaska and around the country.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department is preparing to send election observers to California and New Jersey next month, following requests from their state Republican parties.",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Justice is preparing to send federal election observers to California and New Jersey next month, targeting two Democratic states holding off-year elections following requests from state Republican parties.",
      "The department announced Friday that it is planning to monitor polling sites in Passaic County, New Jersey, and five counties in southern and central California: Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, Riverside and Fresno. The goal, according to the DOJ, is \"to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law.\"",
      "\"Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Election monitoring is a routine function of the Justice Department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely watched elections with national consequences on Nov. 4. New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state's congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "The DOJ's efforts are also the latest salvo in the GOP's preoccupation with election integrity after President Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year's midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.",
      "The announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the Justice Department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states blasted the decision.",
      "New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the move \"highly inappropriate\" and said the department \"has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions.\"",
      "Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, said in a statement that \"No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters.\"",
      "The letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the Associated Press, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.",
      "\"In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,\" wrote GOP Chairwoman Corrin Rankin.",
      "The state is set to vote Nov. 4 on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California's congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its U.S. House delegation.",
      "Each of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.",
      "California is one of at least eight states the Justice Department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.",
      "Election integrity efforts were a focus of Dhillon's California law practice before she joined the Justice Department. Her practice sued over the state's election laws in the past, including a\u00a02020 lawsuit\u00a0on behalf of the California Republican Party challenging ballot collection efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the DOJ has no standing to \"interfere\" with California's election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.",
      "\"Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,\" he said in an email.",
      "Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page said he welcomes anyone who wants to watch the county's election operations and said it's common to have local, state, federal and even international observers. He described Orange County's elections as \"accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.\"",
      "Los Angeles County Clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.",
      "\"Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,\" he said.",
      "Most Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop boxes or at local voting centers, which typically leaves polling places relatively quiet on Election Day. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, the nation's most populous state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks \u2014 and sometimes longer.",
      "In 2024, it took until early December to declare Democrat Adam Gray the winner in his Central Valley district, the final congressional race to be decided in the nation last year.",
      "California's request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to \"oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots\" and \"monitor access to the Board of Elections around the clock\" in suburban Passaic County ahead of the state's governor's race.",
      "The New Jersey Republican State Committee told Dhillon that federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Mr. Trump's column in last year's presidential race.",
      "The county could be critical to GOP gubernatorial nominee Jack Ciattarelli's hopes against Democrat Mikie Sherrill. But the letter cited previous voter fraud cases in the county and alleged a \"long and sordid history\" of vote-by-mail shenanigans.",
      "In 2020, a judge ordered a new election for a city council seat in Paterson \u2014 the largest city in Passaic County \u2014 after the apparent winner and others were charged with voter fraud.",
      "Platkin said the state is committed to ensuring its elections are fair and secure. With the DOJ's announcement, he said the attorney general's office is \"considering all of our options to prevent any effort to intimidate voters or interfere with our elections.\"",
      "Local election offices and polling places around the country already have observers from both political parties to ensure rules are followed. The DOJ also has a long history of sending observers to jurisdictions that have histories of voting rights violations to ensure compliance with federal civil rights laws.",
      "Last year, when the Biden administration was still in power, some Republican-led states said they would not allow federal monitors to access voting locations on Election Day.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against mail voting as part of his repeated false claims that former President Joe Biden's victory in 2020 was rigged. He alleges it is riddled with fraud, even though numerous studies have found no evidence of widespread fraud in U.S. elections.",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump pledged to ban vote-by-mail across the country, something he has no power to do under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "The DOJ's effort will be overseen by Dhillon's Civil Rights Division, which will deploy personnel in coordination with U.S. attorney's offices and work closely with state and local officials, the department said. The department is also soliciting further requests for monitoring in other jurisdictions.",
      "David Becker, a CBS News election law expert and political contributor  who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.",
      "But Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors' presence.",
      "If the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials didn't want them, \"That could result in chaos,\" he said.",

      "Kingston, Jamaica \u2014 Hurricane Melissa was about\u00a0to pummel Jamaica on Tuesday as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, the strongest to lash the island since recordkeeping began 174 years ago.",
      "The storm was expected to make landfall early Tuesday and slice diagonally across the island, entering near St. Elizabeth parish in the south and exiting around St. Ann parish in the north, forecasters said.",
      "Hours before the storm, the government said it had done all it could to prepare as it warned of catastrophic damage.",
      "\"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. \"The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.\"",
      "Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were reported ahead of the storm, with officials in Jamaica cautioning that the cleanup and damage assessment would be slow.",
      "Melissa is expected to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places, the hurricane center said. \"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the center stressed.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots from Monday into Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the center added.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected today into Wednesday on the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline. Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor \"and (we) hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place.\"",
      "The storm already was blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person was missing.",
      "Melissa was centered about 135 miles southwest of Kingston and about 310 miles southwest of Guant\u00e1namo, Cuba. The system had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph, well above the minimum 157 mph needed for it to reach the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. It was moving north-northeast at 2 mph, according to the hurricane center.",
      "\"We will get through it together,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service.",
      "Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps advisor based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.",
      "\"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening,\" he said. \"There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement.\"",
      "Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.",
      "\"Every drop will count,\" he said.",
      "Melissa also was expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba late Tuesday as a powerful hurricane.",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guant\u00e1namo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches of rain was forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.",
      "Cuban officials said Monday that they were evacuating more than 600,000 people from the region, including Santiago, the island's second-largest city.",
      "Melissa also has drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti.",

Hurricane-force winds extended some 30 miles from the storm's center and tropical storm-force winds extended 195 miles. The storm was moving ever-so-slowly north-northeast at a mere 2 mph.",
      "\"On the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to move over Jamaica today, across southeastern Cuba Wednesday morning and across the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "\"Some fluctuations in intensity are likely before Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica later today. However, Melissa is expected to reach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an extremely dangerous major hurricane, and will still be at hurricane strength when it moves across the southeastern Bahamas,\" the center continued.",
      "When Melissa makes landfall, peak storm surge accompanied by destructive waves is forecast to reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level in Jamaica and 7 to 11 feet in Cuba.",
      "The storm's extremely slow pace also raises the risk of destructive impacts, particularly in Jamaica.",
      "\"The devastation is going to be so profound because the storm is moving slowly,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Grant Gilmore said. \"It's going to remain at a very slow pace as it traverses the island. ... All of the threats that a hurricane can unleash on an island, it's all going to happen in Jamaica.\"",
      "Melissa could be the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Jamaica.",
      "\"The island's terrain makes it even worse,\" CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Andrew Kozak\u00a0explained. \"Jamaica's mountains force the air to rise, and that creates more rain.\"",

      "\"Catastrophic flash flooding and landslides are probable across portions of southern Hispaniola and Jamaica,\" forecasters said.",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major storm, according to climate scientists. That translates into stronger winds, heavier rainfall and a higher sea level rise, which would make storm surge more intense.",

      "The slow-moving storm has already killed at least three people in Haiti and a fourth in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing, according to authorities.",
      "\"I want to urge Jamaicans to take this seriously,\" said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council. \"Do not gamble with Melissa. It's not a safe bet.\"",
      "The hurricane was expected to make another landfall later Tuesday in eastern Cuba, where authorities have ordered some 650,000 people to evacuate, according to the country's president. A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guant\u00e1namo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.",
      "Around 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been evacuated from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ahead of Melissa's arrival, a U.S. defense official told CBS News. Meanwhile, some U.S. Navy ships in the region were repositioned out of the hurricane's direct path but remained actively deployed, the official said.",
      "Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service, also warned Melissa could be the strongest hurricane Jamaica has experienced in decades. He said cleanup and damage assessment could be severely delayed because of anticipated landslides, flooding and blocked roads.",

      "The storm has already dropped heavy rain in the Dominican Republic, where schools and government offices were ordered to remain closed on Monday in four of nine provinces still under red alert. The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.",
      "Melissa damaged more than 750 homes across the Dominican Republic, displacing more than 3,760 people and leaving more than half a million without drinking water services, emergency officials said. Floodwaters have also cut access to at least 48 communities, officials said.",
      "In Haiti, the storm destroyed crops in three regions, including 37 acres of maize, at a time when at least 5.7 million people \u2014 more than half the country's population \u2014 are experiencing crisis-level hunger, with 1.9 million of those facing emergency-level hunger.",
      "\"Flooding is obstructing access to farmland and markets, jeopardizing harvests and the winter agricultural season,\" the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization said.",

    "summary": "Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at $102 million last Sunday morning from Paris' famous Louvre museum.",
    "story": [
      "Two people were arrested in connection with the theft of crown jewels from Paris' Louvre museum, a Paris prosecutor said on Sunday, a week after the brazen heist at the world's most visited museum.",
      "The prosecutor said investigators made the arrests Saturday evening, adding that one of the men taken into custody was preparing to leave the country from Paris' Roissy Airport.",
      "French media BFM TV and Le Parisien newspaper earlier reported that two suspects had been arrested and taken into custody. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau did not confirm the number of arrests and did not say whether jewels had been recovered.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria. The official added that one of the suspects was identified through DNA traces. Beccuau said earlier this week that forensics experts were analyzing 150 samples at the scene.",
      "The suspects can be held in police custody up to 96 hours.",
      "Thieves took less than eight minutes to steal jewels valued at $102 million last Sunday morning.",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the museum and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels. The museum's director called the incident a \"terrible failure.\"",
      "Beccuau said investigators from a special police unit in charge of armed robberies, serious burglaries and art thefts made the arrests. She rued in her statement the premature leak of information, saying it could hinder the work of over 100 investigators \"mobilized to recover the stolen jewels and apprehend all of the perpetrators.\" Beccuau said further details will be unveiled after the suspects' custody period ends.",
      "French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez praised \"the investigators who have worked tirelessly, just as I asked them to, and who have always had my full confidence.\"",
      "The theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",
      "One piece \u2014 Eug\u00e9nie's emerald-set imperial crown with more than 1,300 diamonds \u2014 was later found outside the museum, damaged but recoverable.",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "The jewels\u00a0were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture stated in a press release to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",

      "President Trump arrived Monday in Japan, where new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is banking on building a friendly personal relationship with the U.S. leader to ease trade tensions.",
      "Mr. Trump's Asian tour, which kicked off over the weekend, has a heavy focus on business ties, and speaking to journalists as he flew into the Japanese capital, he predicted that a U.S.-China trade agreement would be done before he returned to Washington.",
      "But first, the meeting with Takaichi will be an early diplomatic test for Japan's first woman leader. She took office only last week, and has a tenuous coalition backing her.",
      "During the flight to Tokyo, Mr. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. He said he'd talk about the \"great friendship\" between the U.S. and Japan during his visit.",
      "\"I hear phenomenal things\" about Takaichi, Mr. Trump said, noting her closeness with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Mr. Trump had a good relationship during his first term.",
      "\"It's going to be very good,\" he said. \"That really helps Japan and the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's only scheduled event on Monday following his arrival was a meeting at the Imperial Palace with Emperor Naruhito, Japan's ceremonial head of state. The emperor smiled and waved as Mr. Trump's limousine pulled up to the palace.",
      "They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries before smiling for a photo together, then walked inside the palace for a roughly half-hour meeting that the White House described as a \"courtesy call.\"",
      "The American leader spent Sunday in Malaysia, participating in a regional summit of Southeast Asian nations where he struck preliminary trade agreements with Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Trump says he expects trade deal with China done this week",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he expected to reach a trade agreement with China in the coming days.",
      "Officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday that they'd reached an initial consensus for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to try to finalize during a high-stakes meeting later in the week.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect for President Xi,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"I think we're going to come away with a deal,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Bessent also\u00a0said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a TikTok deal announced last month was set to be finalized Thursday during the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "After his visit to Japan, Mr. Trump is set to end his Asian tour in South Korea, where he's expected to meet with Xi on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).",
      "Trump renews openness to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be willing to extend his trip to Asia if there was a chance to talk with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un Kim. Since South Korea is the president's last stop before returning to the U.S., \"it's pretty easy to do,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",
      "Mr. Trump's overtures to reconnect with Kim have gone unanswered.",
      "\"If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump rules out running for U.S. vice presidency",
      "On other matters, Mr. Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice president as a way to get back to the presidency, saying, \"I'd be allowed to do it,\" but \"I wouldn't do that.\"",
      "\"I think it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think the people wouldn't like that. It's too cute. It's not \u2014 it wouldn't be right.\"",
      "Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, has repeatedly said the president could serve a third term despite a constitutional prohibition. Mr. Trump himself has flirted with the idea.",
      "On Air Force One, Mr. Trump said, \"I haven't really thought about it.\"",
      "He praised Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as potential future Republican candidates. \"I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,\" he said.",
      "South China Sea, Taiwan, and tariffs",
      "There's no shortage of security issues in the region, including access to the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan. But Mr. Trump's focus has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of \"America first.\"",
      "For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Mr. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports \u2014 from allies and adversaries alike \u2014   in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.",
      "However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. The president is awaiting a Supreme Court decision in a case that could solidify his authority or limit it.",
      "The president flew to Tokyo from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he attended the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He participated in a ceremonial signing of an expanded ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, which fought earlier this year.

      "According to Israel's military, the remains of a hostage were transferred to the Red Cross on Monday and are on the way to IDF troops in the Gaza Strip for identification. The transfer and expanded search for the rest of the hostages' bodies came a day after Egypt deployed a team of experts to help retrieve the bodies.",

      "It was the same area that Israel targeted in a series of strikes on Oct. 19, after the military accused\u00a0Hamas militants\u00a0of killing two Israeli soldiers. That day, Israel launched dozens of deadly strikes across Gaza, killing at least 36 Palestinians, including women and children, according to the strip's Hamas-run health authorities. It was the\u00a0most serious challenge to the fragile ceasefire.",

    "summary": "Police release video showing officers on a speed boat intercepting the alleged drug-trafficking ship.",
    "story": [
      "Spanish police said Sunday that they seized 6.5 tons of cocaine and arrested nine people after a U.S. tip-off led them to raid a ship off the Canary Islands a few days ago.",
      "In a statement, police said the narcotics were hidden in the hold of the boat, which was flying a Tanzanian flag and had departed from Panama en route to Vigo, in north-west Spain. The cargo ship, which was approximately 177 feet long, had unusual structures on board which concealed the narcotics, officials said.",
      "The Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. federal agency responsible for combating drug trafficking, provided key \"information\" that enabled the operation to succeed, the press release stated.",
      "Police released\u00a0video on social media showing officers on a speed boat intercepting the alleged drug-trafficking ship.",
      "Spain is one of the main gateways for cocaine into Europe, due to its links with Latin America, where the drug is produced, and its geographical location in the southwest of the continent.",
      "In June, police forces from multiple countries dismantled a drug trafficking ring that used what authorities called high-speed \"narco boats\" to smuggle large quantities of cocaine from Brazil and Colombia to the Canary Islands. The ring allegedly used an abandoned shipwreck as a refueling platform for the speedboats.",
      "Spanish police made their biggest ever cocaine seizure last October when they discovered some 13 tons hidden in a shipment of bananas to the southern port of Algeciras. Intelligence from Ecuadoran police tipped off the Spanish authorities, national police said at the time.",
      "Large amounts of drugs have also been confiscated from boats in other parts of the world recently. Earlier this month, U.S. Central Command confirmed that a Pakistani navy ship seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea. Last month, the French navy seized nearly\u00a010 tons of cocaine\u00a0worth more than $600 million from a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa.",
      "In April, the U.S. Coast Guard seized roughly\u00a010,000 pounds of cocaine\u00a0from a fishing boat in the Atlantic Ocean.",

    "summary": "The Murray cod, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian freshwater Murray cod has surprised scientists by swimming a marathon 530 miles along a major river system, believed to be a record for the species.",
      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",
      "The decade-long fish tagging project works closely with the Mallee Catchment Management Authority. It is funded by the state-financed Living Murray program, managed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.",
      "According to the Australian Museum, the Murray cod has a concave snout with a large mouth and small eyes. It preys on fish, mollusks, turtles and some small terrestrial animals, including birds, mammals and snakes.",
      "Murray cod are listed as \"vulnerable\" under Australia's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species' populations have declined dramatically, according to the Australian Museum, initially because of commercial fishing.",
      "\"More recently, overfishing, river degradation and human modification of the environment have caused major population declines,\" the museum says. \"Murray Cod are now relatively uncommon in most areas.\"",

      "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 A powerful paramilitary force fighting the government in Sudan's raging two-and-a-half-year civil war claimed over the weekend to have captured the city of El-Fasher, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have been trapped, cut off from the world for months.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the French news agency AFP that the violence around El-Fasher, the last city in the Darfur region not held by the Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries, \"represents a terrible escalation in the conflict.\"",
      "\"The level of suffering that we are witnessing in Sudan is unbearable,\" he said.",
      "Reports circulating on social media on Sunday said RSF forces had taken control of the Sudanese Armed Forces' 6th Division Headquarters in El-Fasher.",
      "The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), which has monitored the war, said it was able to confirm from satellite imagery that RSF forces launched a major attack on El-Fasher on Sunday.",
      "The HRL said there was \"evidence of close-quarter battle\" in the city, and that the \"activity \"may be consistent with reporting that RSF has taken prisoners in and around the [army] airfield.\"",
      "The Yale lab said it would continue to monitor satellite imagery for any evidence of \"mass atrocities\" committed in El-Fasher.",
      "The RSF claimed in a statement to have taken full control of the city, but the army said fighting continued, and independent analysts said the claim could not be verified.",
      "The U.N. has called for civilians trapped inside the Sudanese city - of whom there are believed to be some 250,000 - to be allowed to leave. U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called for a ceasefire in the town to allow people to flee.",
      "The RSF forces have encircled El-Fasher for weeks, building an earthen berm around the city to stop supplies getting in and people getting out. It is the last remaining stronghold of the Sudanese army in the Darfur region, and if the RSF does fully capture El-Fasher, it would leave the group in control of all five of Darfur's states.",
      "Analysts have warned that the RSF has indicated it would move to formally partition Sudan and set up a parallel government in the areas under its control.",
      "Unverified images posted on social media appeared to show RSF fighters walking among bodies and injured civilians as fighters celebrated inside El-Fasher on Sunday.",
      "Fighting has raged around El-Fasher for 18 months, leaving tens of thousands of trapped residents starved of every necessity from food to medical supplies, and with little means of communicating with the outside world. From the few witness accounts to emerge, it's been clear that drone and artillery strikes have become a part of daily life as the army and RSF battled over the city.",
      "Sudan's civil war broke out in April 2023, when a power sharing agreement between commanders of the army and the RSF collapsed over plans to combine their forces. Fighting has raged ever since, and both sides have been accused of suspected war crimes as the fighting fuels what the U.N. considers the world's single largest humanitarian crisis.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:44:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei declares himself \"king of a lost world\" after midterms victory aided by massive bailout by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment \u2014 with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration.",
      "In the election widely seen as a referendum on self-described \"anarcho-capitalist\" Milei's past two years in office, which have included corruption scandals and the scrapping of tens of thousands of public jobs, his right-wing La Libertad Avanza party won more than 40% of the votes, compared with 31% for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections.",
      "Milei, a key ideological ally of President Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, three seats short of a congressional majority.",
      "\"I am the king of a lost world,\" Milei exulted as his supporters cheered in downtown Buenos Aires on Sunday. \"Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.\"",
      "An Argentine legislative election has likely rarely generated so much interest in Washington, or on Wall Street.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to condition a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank, and an additional $20 billion loan from private banks, on a good showing for Milei in the national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory.",
      "\"If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Mr. Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month.",
      "Those comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms, and analysts predicted a tight midterm race.",
      "To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves. Then, in an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the international credit line.",
      "In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday.",
      "\"For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,\" Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage, told The Associated Press. \"It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023.\"",
      "The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the political outsider inherited in late 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump, during a flight to Japan on Monday, said on his Truth Social network that Milei was \"doing a wonderful job.\"",
      "\"Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Milei responded to the post, calling the U.S. president \"a great friend\" of Argentina and thanking him for \"trusting the Argentine people.\"",
      "Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Mr. Trump for his role in helping Milei at the polls.",
      "Kicillof  warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy.",
      "\"I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,\" he said. \"If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.\"",
      "Sunday's outcome will test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although his budget cuts have slashed inflation \u2014 from an annual high of 289% in April 2024 to 32% last month \u2014 consumer price increases still outpace salaries and pensions.",
      "The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before.",
      "In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment.",
      "But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifan\u00eda Contreras, 64, told the AP that she as though she was bearing the brunt of the federal budget cuts.",
      "\"You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,\" she said, describing how her monthly pension, worth about $200, has shriveled in value as a result of austerity measures. \"The situation is getting worse and worse.\"",
      "More than 250,000 jobs have been lost since Milei came to power, with around 18,000 businesses closing, according to an analysis published this month by the Center for Argentine Political Economy think tank, as the right-wing administration froze investment in infrastructure, health care, education and other social services.",
      "Voting is compulsory for adults in Argentina, but electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68% on Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's return to democracy in 1983.",
      "\"I vote out of obligation, nothing more,\" Mat\u00edas Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate, told the AP. \"None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil.\"",

      "A U.S. warship docked in\u00a0Trinidad and Tobago's capital on Sunday as the Trump administration boosts its military pressure on neighboring Venezuela and President\u00a0Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The arrival of the USS Gravely, a guided missile destroyer, in the capital of the Caribbean nation joins the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which is moving closer to Venezuela. Maduro criticized the movement of the carrier as an attempt by the U.S government to fabricate \"a new eternal war\" against his country.",
      "The Venezuelan government on Sunday denounced the presence of the destroyer, calling it a \"hostile provocation against Venezuela and a serious threat to the peace of the Caribbean,\" and accused the U.S. of preparing to launch a false flag attack.",
      "\"Venezuela reports that it has captured a mercenary group with direct information from the U.S. intelligence agency, CIA, being able to determine that a false flag attack is underway from waters bordering Trinidad and Tobago, or from Trinidad or Venezuelan territory itself,\" the government said in a statement.",
      "President\u00a0Trump has accused Maduro, without providing evidence, of being the leader of the organized crime gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday, \"We are involved in a counterdrug operation. The president has made this very clear.\"",
      "Government officials from Trinidad and Tobago and the U.S. said the massive warship will remain in Trinidad until Thursday so both countries can carry out training exercises.",
      "A senior military official in Trinidad and Tobago told The Associated Press that the move was only recently scheduled. The official spoke under the condition of anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, has been a vocal supporter of the U.S. military presence and the deadly strikes on suspected drug boats in waters off Venezuela. The wife of\u00a0Alejandro Carranza, one of the more than 30 people killed in the strikes, claimed he left home on Colombia's Caribbean coast to fish in open waters and denied he had any link to drug trafficking.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has said\u00a0the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "Rubio said Sunday that countries like Trinidad and Tobago cooperate with the U.S.'s drug operations, but, \"We have no drug cooperation with the regime in Venezuela, primarily because they're not legitimate and because they're part of it. They're part of the drug operation.\"",
      "In an interview aired Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said land strikes in Venezuela are a \"real possibility\" amid rising tensions.",
      "\"I think President Trump's made a decision that Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, is an indicted drug trafficker, that it's time for him to go. That Venezuela and Colombia have been safe havens for narco terrorists for too long,\" the Republican senator told Margaret Brennan. \"And President Trump told me yesterday that he plans to brief members of Congress when he gets back from Asia about future potential military operations against Venezuela and Colombia.\"",
      "Venezuela's government said Sunday, \"By bending to Washington's militarist agenda, Persad-Bissessar not only intends to attack Venezuela ... and break our historical bonds of brotherhood, but also violates the Charter of the United Nations, the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Peace Zone approved by CELAC and the principles of CARICOM.\"",
      "\"Venezuela does not accept threats from any U.S. vassal government,\" the country's government added. \"We are not intimidated by military exercises or war cries.\"",
      "U.S. Embassy Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires Jenifer Neidhart de Ortiz said in a statement that the exercises seek to \"address shared threats like transnational crime and build resilience through training, humanitarian missions, and security efforts.\"",
      "The visit comes one week after the U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago warned Americans to stay away from U.S. government facilities there. Local authorities said a reported threat against Americans prompted the warning.",
      "People in Trinidad and Tobago have criticize the warship's docking in town at a recent demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy.\u00a0 David Abdulah, the leader of the Movement for Social Justice political party, said Trinidad and Tobago should not have allowed the warship into its waters.",
      "\"This is a warship in Trinidad, which will be anchored here for several days just miles off Venezuela when there's a threat of war,\" said Abdulah, who is also the leader of the Movement for Social Justice political party. \"That's an abomination.\"",
      "Caricom, a regional trade bloc made up of 15 Caribbean countries, has called for dialogue. Trinidad and Tobago is a member of the group, but Persad-Bissessar has said the region is not a zone of peace, citing the number of murders and other violent crimes.",

    "summary": "Lithuania accuses Belarus and Russia of a \"deliberate escalation of hybrid warfare\" as balloons shut down major airport.",
    "story": [
      "The government of Lithuania, which is a member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, said Monday that it will start shooting down unidentified balloons that enter the country's airspace, after a number of them allegedly launched from neighboring Belarus forced the repeated closure of a major airport.",
      "Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene warned Monday that any further balloons detected would be shot down after operations at Vilnius International Airport, which serves the capital city, were halted a total of four times last week.",
      "\"Today we have decided to take the strictest measures, there is no other way,\" Ruginiene told journalists, according to Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT, calling the incidents \"hybrid attacks\" and saying her country could discuss invoking the collective defense clause in the founding NATO treaty over the incidents.",
      "Article 4 can be invoked by any NATO member that feels its security is at risk, which would spark talks among the allies to discuss the threat. Article 4 has been invoked nine times in NATO's history, three of which related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Lithuania believes smugglers use the balloons to transport contraband cigarettes over the border, but it has criticized Belorussian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin, for not clamping down.",
      "\"Inaction is also an action,\" Ruginiene said after a meeting of her country's National Security Commission on Monday. \"If Belarus does nothing about it and does not fight, we also assess these actions accordingly.\"",
      "Ruginiene added that her government would indefinitely close its land border with Belarus, apart from for diplomats and returning European Union nationals, according to LRT.",
      "\"This is how we send a signal to Belarus and say that no hybrid attack will be tolerated here, we will take all the strictest measures to stop such attacks,\" she said.",
      "\"Our response will determine how far autocrats dare to go,\" Ruginiene's office said in a statement sent later Monday to CBS News.",
      "There was no immediate comment on the incident from officials in Belarus.",
      "Many of America's European allies have had their airspace breached in recent weeks, mostly by unclaimed drones sighted around airports and military facilities in Germany, Denmark and the Baltic states. Estonia also accused Russian fighter jets of flying through its airspace for 12 minutes in mid-September.",
      "Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said Monday in a post on social media that NATO was facing a \"deliberate escalation of hybrid warfare from Russia and its proxy, Belarus,\" calling the spate of recent airspace incursions, \"calculated provocations designed to destabilize, distract and test NATO's resolve.\"",
      "He called for further sanctions against Belarus and stronger NATO security measures to deter the airspace violations.",
      "On October 23, a Russian Sukhoi SU-30 fighter and an IL-78 tanker plane flew just under half of a mile into Lithuanian territory, according to the country's ministry of foreign affairs, after departing from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. The Baltic Sea coastal territory is separate from the rest of Russia, and bordered on two sides by Lithuania and Poland.",
      "Two days before that, several \"meteorological balloons\" launched from Belarus were detected by Lithuanian radar systems in the country's airspace, disrupting travel at Vilnius' airport, the foreign ministry said.",
      "Lithuania summoned the top Belorussian diplomat in the country on October 22 to voice a \"strong protest regarding the repeated and increasingly frequent violations\" of its airspace, warning the Russian ally that Vilnius \"reserves the right to take appropriate retaliatory measures.\"",
      "Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center said earlier this month that at least 544 balloons had already entered Lithuanian airspace this year, according to CBS News' partner network BBC News. The center said 966 such balloon incursions were recorded during 2024.",
      "\"Last year we were blind chickens and didn't see many things,\" Ruginiene said Monday. \"Thank God, there was no catastrophe. We didn't see certain moving objects, so there were no decisions to close the airspace.\"",
      "\"Today we have much better equipment, we can see much more information,\" she said, according to LRT. \"We believe that we need to take action to protect our citizens.\"",

    "title": "Half of uncontacted tribes could be wiped out in 10 years, report says",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uncontacted-indigenous-tribes-report-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Loggers were killed after entering Mashco Piro territory in Peru's Amazon, with Indigenous leaders warning that such clashes are inevitable when frontier zones go unpoliced.",
    "story": [
      "From the depths of Brazil's Amazon to Indonesia's rainforests, some of the world's most isolated peoples are being squeezed by roads, miners and drug traffickers \u2014 a crisis unfolding far from public view or effective state protection.",
      "A new report by Survival International, a London-based Indigenous rights organization, attempts one of the broadest tallies yet, identifying at least 196 uncontacted Indigenous groups in 10 countries, primarily in the South American nations sharing the Amazon rainforest. Released Sunday, the report estimates that nearly 65% face threats from logging, about 40% from mining and around 20% from agribusiness.",
      "\"These are what I would call silent genocides \u2014 there are no TV crews, no journalists. But they are happening, and they're happening now,\" said Fiona Watson, Survival's research and advocacy director, who has worked on Indigenous rights for more than three decades.",
      "The issue often receives little priority from governments, which critics say see uncontacted peoples as politically marginal because they don't vote and their territories are often coveted for logging, mining and oil extraction. Public debate is also shaped by stereotypes - some romanticize them as \"lost tribes,\" while others view them as barriers to development.",
      "Survival's research concludes that half of these groups \"could be wiped out within 10 years if governments and companies do not act.\"",
      "Who the uncontacted peoples are",
      "Uncontacted peoples are not \"lost tribes\" frozen in time, Watson said. They are contemporary societies that deliberately avoid outsiders after generations of violence, slavery and disease.",
      "\"They don't need anything from us,\" Watson said. \"They're happy in the forest. They have incredible knowledge and they help keep these very valuable forests standing \u2014 essential to all humanity in the fight against climate change.\"",
      "Survival's research shows that more than 95% of the world's uncontacted peoples live in the Amazon, with smaller populations in South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. These communities live by hunting, fishing and small-scale cultivation, maintaining languages and traditions that predate modern nation-states.",
      "Why contact can be deadly",
      "Groups living in voluntary isolation have \"minimal to no contact with those outside of their own group,\" said Dr. Subhra Bhattacharjee, director general of the Forest Stewardship Council and an Indigenous rights expert based in Bonn, Germany. \"A simple cold that you and I recover from in a week \u2026 they could die of that cold.\"",
      "Beyond disease, contact can destroy livelihoods and belief systems. International law requires free, prior and informed consent \u2014 known as FPIC \u2014 before any activity on Indigenous lands.",
      "\"But when you have groups living in voluntary isolation, who you cannot get close to without risking their lives, you cannot get FPIC,\" Bhattacharjee said. \"No FPIC means no consent.\"",
      "Her organization follows a strict policy: \"No contact, no-go zones,\" she said, arguing that if consent cannot be obtained safely, contact should not occur at all.",
      "The Associated Press reported last year on loggers who were killed by bow and arrow after entering Mashco Piro territory in Peru's Amazon, with Indigenous leaders warning that such clashes are inevitable when frontier zones go unpoliced.",
      "There have been several other previous reports of conflicts. In one incident in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing, one fatally, in an encounter with tribal members.",
      "In 2018, American\u00a0John Allen Chau\u00a0was killed after kayaking to a remote Indian island populated by an isolated tribe known for shooting at outsiders with bows and arrows.",
      "How the threats have evolved",
      "Watson, who has worked across the Amazon for 35 years, said early threats stemmed from colonization and state-backed infrastructure. During Brazil's military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985, highways were bulldozed through the rainforest \"without due regard\" for the people living there.",
      "\"The roads acted as a magnet for settlers,\" she said, describing how loggers and cattle ranchers followed, bringing gunmen and disease that wiped out entire communities.",
      "A group known as\u00a0FENAMAD, which defends the rights of Peru's Indigenous peoples, says\u00a0tensions between loggers and Indigenous tribes\u00a0are on the rise and more government protective action is needed.",
      "A railway line now planned in Brazil could potentially affect three uncontacted peoples, she said, but the rise of organized crime poses an even greater risk.",
      "Across Peru, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador, drug traffickers and illegal gold miners have moved deep into Indigenous territories. \"Any chance encounter runs the risk of transmitting the flu, which can easily wipe out an uncontacted people within a year of contact,\" she said. \"And bows and arrows are no match for guns.\"",
      "Evangelical missionary incursions have also caused outbreaks. Watson recalled how, under former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an evangelical pastor was placed in charge of the government's unit for uncontacted peoples and gained access to their coordinates. \"Their mission was to force contact \u2014 to 'save souls,'\" she said. \"That is incredibly dangerous.\"",
      "Ways to protect uncontacted peoples",
      "Protecting uncontacted peoples, experts say, will require both stronger laws and a shift in how the world views them \u2014 not as relics of the past, but as citizens of the planet whose survival affects everyone's future.",
      "Advocates have several recommendations.",
      "First, governments must formally recognize and enforce Indigenous territories, making them off-limits to extractive industries.",
      "Mapping is crucial, Bhattacharjee said, because identifying the approximate territories of uncontacted peoples allows governments to protect those areas from loggers or miners. But, she added, it must be done with extreme caution and from a distance to avoid contact that could endanger the groups' health or autonomy.",
      "Second, corporations and consumers must help stop the flow of money driving destruction. Survival's report calls for companies to trace their supply chains to ensure that commodities such as gold, timber and soy are not sourced from Indigenous lands.",
      "\"Public opinion and pressure are essential,\" Watson said. \"It's largely through citizens and the media that so much has already been achieved to recognize uncontacted peoples and their rights.\"",
      "Finally, advocates say the world must recognize why their protection matters. Beyond human rights, these communities play an outsized role in stabilizing the global climate.",
      "\"With the world under pressure from climate change, we will sink or swim together,\" Bhattacharjee said.",
      "Governments' uneven response",
      "International treaties such as the International Labor Organization's Convention 169 and the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirm the right to self-determination and to remain uncontacted if they choose. But enforcement varies widely.",
      "In Peru, Congress recently rejected a proposal to create the Yavari-Mirim Indigenous Reserve, a move Indigenous federations said leaves isolated groups exposed to loggers and traffickers.",
      "In Brazil, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has sought to rebuild protections weakened under Bolsonaro, boosting budgets and patrols. In 2018,\u00a0footage showed an indigenous man\u00a0believed to be the last remaining member of an isolated tribe in the Brazilian Amazon.",
      "And in Ecuador, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled this year that the government failed to protect the Tagaeri and Taromenane peoples who live in voluntary isolation in Yasuni National Park.",
      "Watson warned that political forces tied to agribusiness and evangelical blocs are now working to roll back earlier gains.",
      "\"Achievements of the last 20 or 30 years are in danger of being dismantled,\" she said.",
      "In July 2024,\u00a0photos emerged of the uncontacted tribe\u00a0searching for food on a beach in the Peruvian Amazon. Survival International\u00a0said\u00a0at the time the photos and videos posted showed about 53 male Mashco Piro. The group estimated as many as 100 to 150 tribal members would have been in the area with women and children nearby.",
      "\"This is irrefutable evidence that many Mashco Piro live in this area, which the government has not only failed to protect but actually sold off to logging companies,\" Alfredo Vargas Pio, president of local Indigenous organization FENAMAD, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time.",
      "A 2023 report by the United Nations' special reporter on\u00a0the rights of Indigenous peoples\u00a0said Peru's government had recognized in 2016 that the Mashco Piro and other isolated tribes were using territories that had been opened to logging. The report expressed concern for the overlap, and that the territory of Indigenous peoples hadn't been marked out \"despite reasonable evidence of their presence since 1999.\"",
      "What the new report calls for",
      "Survival International's report urges a global no-contact policy: legal recognition of uncontacted territories, suspension of mining, oil and agribusiness projects in or near those lands and prosecution of crimes against Indigenous groups.",
      "Watson said logging remains the biggest single threat, but mining is close behind. She pointed to the uncontacted Hongana Manyawa on Indonesia's Halmahera Island, where nickel for electric-vehicle batteries is being mined.",
      "\"People think electric cars are a green alternative,\" she said, \"but mining companies are operating on the land of uncontacted peoples and posing enormous threats.\"",
      "In South America, illegal gold miners in the Yanomami territory of Brazil and Venezuela continue to use mercury to extract gold - contamination that has poisoned rivers and fish.",
      "\"The impact is devastating \u2014 socially and physically,\" Watson said.",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Oct 2025 12:48:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The boy ate between 80 and 100 magnets, which he said had been purchased from an online retailer.",
    "story": [
      "A 13-year-old boy was hospitalized after eating dozens of high-powered magnets, according to a recently published case report in the New Zealand Medical Journal. The boy lost part of his bowel as a result, doctors wrote.",
      "The boy, who was not identified in the case report, ate between 80 and 100 magnets. The \"high-power\" magnets were 5x2 millimeters each, the report said.",
      "After eating the magnets, the teen had general abdominal pain for four days. When he arrived at the hospital, he told doctors he had eaten the magnets about a week earlier. The hospital he was treated at was not identified in the report.",
      "The case report did not say if the boy explained why or how he ate the magnets.",
      "Eating multiple magnets can be incredibly dangerous because they can clamp together inside the body and cause organ damage or other complications. Patients who eat multiple magnets often need surgical intervention, according to the report. High-powered magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys for adults, are particularly risky. They can be five to 10 times stronger than traditional refrigerator magnets, CBS News reported in 2019.",
      "Scans showed that the magnets had linked into four chains inside the teen's bowel and at the start of his large intestine. The amount of magnets in his body disrupted some imaging, the report said, so doctors proceeded with an exploratory surgery.",
      "During the operation, surgeons found the magnet chains were causing pressure necrosis in the bowel and large intestine. Pressure necrosis occurs when tissue dies because there is too much pressure on it for an extended period of time. The surgeons were able to successfully remove the magnets, and the boy recovered from the operation. He was discharged after eight days in the hospital, the report said.",
      "The sale of these high-powered magnets has been permanently banned in New Zealand, but the prohibition is difficult to enforce because the magnets can be easily and cheaply purchased online, the report noted. The boy told doctors he purchased the magnets on the online site Temu.",
      "Temu told CBS News that they were \"sorry to learn about the reported incident and wish the boy a full and speedy recovery.\" A\u00a0Temu spokesperson told CBS News Saturday they had not been able to independently verify if the magnets were bought on the site.",
      "The company said after launching an internal review that\u00a0listings currently available to ship to New Zealand are compliant with the country's regulations.",
      "\"While these products are lawful to sell, they can be dangerous if swallowed and we support efforts to raise public awareness about magnet safety,\" the company said.",
      "\"We take product safety very seriously and continuously monitor our platform to ensure sellers are complying with the safety regulations of the markets they are doing business in,\" the spokesperson said Friday.",
      "Online retailers, including Amazon and AliExpress, list high-powered magnets as available to ship to New Zealand.",
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has worked to limit the sale of high-powered magnets in the United States. In 2014, the agency issued a ban on high-powered magnet sets, but it was overturned in court two years later. In September 2022, the agency established a mandatory safety standard for magnets. The rule sets a power limit for any product with loose or separable magnets, including those intended for purposes including entertainment and stress relief.",
      "The CPSC also\u00a0calls the magnets a safety risk and has issued numerous recalls for products that contain them.",

    "summary": "Since September, the U.S. has been carrying out strikes on alleged drug cartel boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. has been carrying out intermittent strikes on vessels alleged to be carrying drug smugglers and illegal narcotics in international waters off South American coastlines since early September.",
      "President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth say the boats were known to be involved in drug smuggling, and insist they have the authority to carry out the strikes without authorization from Congress. Mr. Trump has long decried the influence of drug cartels in the United States, although the lethal strikes represent the biggest escalation in his war on drugs.",
      "Here's what's known about the Trump administration's strikes.",
      "How many boats have been struck?",
      "As of Friday, Oct. 24, the Trump administration has publicly disclosed strikes on 10 vessels since the president revealed the first operation on Sept. 2.",
      "The latest strike, on Oct. 24, was carried out against a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua that Hegseth said was trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea. Hegseth said the U.S. operation killed six individuals.",
      "Where are they being targeted?",
      "Most of the strikes have taken place in the Caribbean, although the operation recently expanded into the Eastern Pacific. Two strikes in the Pacific have been disclosed by the administration.",
      "Several have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, which has been a key target in the president's war on drugs, as has Colombia.",
      "Are there plans for strikes on land?",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday it's possible that the U.S. may begin carrying out strikes on land. So far, the administration says it has only targeted vessels in international waters.",
      "\"The drugs coming in by sea are like 5% of what they were a year ago, less than 5%. So now, they're coming in by land,\" Mr. Trump said on Oct. 23. \"And even the land is a concern, because I told them, that's going to be next. You know, the land is going to be next.\"",
      "How many people have been killed in the strikes?",
      "At least 43 people have been killed in the strikes as of Friday, Oct. 24, according to the numbers released by the Trump administration. The first confirmed strike on Sept. 2 in the Caribbean resulted in the largest number of casualties, killing 11.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleges an attack in September killed a fisherman, not a drug smuggler, and claims the U.S. has committed \"murder.\" Mr. Trump, in response, called Petro an \"illegal drug leader\" and said the U.S. is cutting off all aid to the country. On Friday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Petro and members of his family.",
      "Have there been any survivors?",
      "There were two survivors in an Oct. 16 strike on a vessel in the Caribbean. The two survivors were repatriated to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia, for \"detention and prosecution.\" The survivor turned over by the U.S. to Ecuador was released because authorities said they found no evidence that he had committed a crime.",
      "The Colombian citizen who survived was hospitalized after being repatriated but will face prosecution. Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said he \"arrived with brain trauma, sedated, drugged, breathing with a ventilator.\"",
      "How are the vessels being hit?",
      "The strikes are being conducted by the U.S. military, although the military hasn't disclosed tactical details of its operations. A source familiar with the operations said U.S. special operations forces are conducting the strikes. The Pentagon has used U.S. intelligence to carry out operations.",
      "Is this legal?",
      "The White House is required by the National Defense Authorization Act to notify Congress when it conducts a military attack. After a strike in mid-September, the administration sent a notice to Congress that called the three individuals who were killed in the strike \"unlawful combatants.\" This is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In its notification to Congress, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels. The president hasn't indicated that he thinks he needs congressional authorization.",
      "The president, asked on Oct. 23 by a reporter why he wouldn't ask Congress to declare war and authorize the strikes, replied, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Okay? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Democrats and some Republicans in Congress worry the strikes could lead to a larger conflict in the Caribbean. GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said he wonders why U.S. leaders \"would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are.\" He says he wants to force a vote with a bipartisan group of senators to block the president from military action in the region unless explicitly authorized by Congress.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats ineffective, since the strikes are largely targeting alleged lower-level smugglers.",
      "\"You have to capture the bosses,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "What else is the Trump administration doing to combat drug trafficking from Latin America?",

      "Participants who added backward walking to their routines several times a week for six weeks reported significant improvements in knee function and pain reduction compared to those who stuck with standard forward walking.",
      "Researchers found that walking backward changes how muscles around the knee work. Because the stride is shorter and the landing is softer, it reduces compressive forces on the joints, meaning less wear and tear over time.",
      "SIMPLE JAPANESE FITNESS TREND COULD ADD 7 YEARS TO LIFE EXPECTANCY, EXPERTS SAY",
      "Another recent study, published in PLOS One, examined how backward walking affects people with chronic lower back pain. After several weeks of incorporating the exercise, participants showed both lower pain levels and better control of their lumbopelvic movement, which is the coordination between the lower back and pelvis that helps stabilize the spine.",
      "Walking backward engages muscles that are often underused. (iStock)",

      "Walking backward can also aid spatial awareness and coordination. (iStock)",
      "The Cleveland Clinic notes that backward walking isn\u2019t only good for the joints, but also a workout for the mind. Moving in reverse challenges spatial awareness, coordination and concentration. That extra mental effort strengthens the connection between your brain and muscles, helping improve balance and reaction time.",
      "It\u2019s also more physically demanding than it looks.

      "Health start-up 'SpotitEarly' is using dogs to help sniff out the four most common types of cancer, helping people detect the disease early.",
      "Like all beagles, Iceman has an incredible sense of smell. \u00a0His nose is so powerful, it's used to sniff out cancer. \u00a0Using the beagles' remarkable sense of smell, health startup 'Spotitearly' has created a test for people to get pre-screened for cancer as a way to increase chances of early detection. \u00a0\"Only 14% of the newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. are done so through the routine screening. So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

Well, firstly, rough estimates are that there are about 730,000 H-1B holders in the U.S. and about 550,000 dependents. Most of them, in excess of 70% of them, are in IT.\"",
      "TRUMP\u2019S H-1B VISA REFORM PLAN NEEDS TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST",
      "The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. (Reuters/Jason Reed)",
      "Vianello went on to explain that data shows H-1B visa holders are paid \"significantly less\" than their counterparts doing equivalent IT roles, which gives them a leg up with employers who are looking to pay less.",
      "\"I think it gets a little more broadly than that,\" Vianello said. \"In addition to competing with H-1B visa holders, college graduates, especially in IT, are also competing with OPT visa holders. This is optional practical training, basically an extension of the F-1 visa, which is a student visa, which allows you, if you're a STEM graduate, to work in the U.S. for three years following your graduation.\"",
      "\"Now, the OPT visa holders don't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes, so they're automatically 15% cheaper, and they are typically paid 42% less than their U S counterparts. So as a college grad, you're fighting this three-headed monster. You're graduating with student debt, you've got H-1B visa holders and OPT visa holders who have the ability to take your job and cost an employer significantly less, and then you're competing with the third one, which is the ability of an employer to simply offshore that work.\"",
      "Many tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa \u2013 as a company is required to sponsor the visa \u2013 and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country.",

      "U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (Celal Gunes/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"The reason I\u2019m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,\" Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk posted on X last year as a\u00a0rift inside the MAGA movement was\u00a0raging on the issue.",
      "\"The intention was good around bringing in people with skills and retaining people in the US that are doing skills and are studying in the universities,\" Vianello said. \"But the outcome to college grads that are competing for those roles has been really bad.\"",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration\u00a0unveiled a proposal designed to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.",
      "The $100,000 fee \u2014 a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions \u2014 will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached.",
      "\"The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee, so it\u2019s just not [economical],\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Friday as Trump signed the order.",
      "Vianello told Fox News Digital, \"Certainly I think that the $100,000 fee on any new applications is gonna go a long way toward changing behavior, but that's focused on H-1B.\"",

      "President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on Sept. 19, 2025. (Aaron Schwartz/CNP/Bloomberg/Getty Images)",
      "\"We've seen quite a bit of news recently around changes to the OPT visa program as well in terms of limiting the number of visas and limiting the countries that they come from. That's gonna have a significant impact on the pipeline of people coming through as well. And so I believe those measures are gonna start changing the behavior of many of the employers.\"",
      "The argument from H-1B supporters that the United States is bringing in the \"best and the brightest\" is a sentiment Vianello pushed back on.",
      "\"In the last 18 months, according to layoffs.fyi, these large companies have laid off 250,000 tech professionals, but at the same time, the cap for H-1B visas was secured before the end of 2024 for the entire 2025, which is 85,000 people,\" Vianello explained. \"So you're laying off 250,000 U.S. tech workers, but you're applying for the maximum cap that you can for H-1B visa holders. That doesn't make sense. If there's a shortage of skills, why are you laying off 250,000 people? So you can see the way it's structured. It's being used as a labor arbitrage to bring down these large companies' tech costs.\"",
      "Vianello, who came here on a visa, told Fox News Digital he is not opposed to worker visa programs in general, but stressed they shouldn't leave American workers behind.",
      "\"I fully support using visas to attract top-tier technologists to the U.S. I came here on a Specialty Occupation Visa myself, which required my employer to invest significantly to bring me over,\" Vianello said. \"What I oppose is the misuse of programs like H-1B and OPT as tools for labor arbitrage, which undercuts entry-level opportunities for U.S. tech graduates and distorts the talent market.\"",

      "The Tomahawk has long been one of the most recognizable weapons in America\u2019s arsenal. At $2 million per missile and $6 million per launcher, it can strike up to 1,500 miles into enemy territory.",
      "If the United States were to authorize Ukraine to use it, it would mark a dramatic escalation in both capability and psychology. For the first time, Russian forces and strategic sites far beyond the front lines \u2014 including inside Russian territory \u2014 would fall within reach of a Western-supplied, precision long-range weapon that Moscow has no reliable defense against.",

      "Critically, it would give Ukraine the ability to hit at Russia's energy industry, which, through exports to nations like China, Iran and India, funds the war effort.",
      "Ukraine has used ATACMS systems to strike behind enemy lines in Russian-occupied Ukraine and near Russia\u2019s borders \u2014 helicopter shelters, ammunition depots and runways.

      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural. Critics argue that it invites risky behavior at a time when regulators like the NHTSA and California DMV are already investigating Tesla's advanced driver-assist systems.",
      "TESLA'S SELF-DRIVING CARS UNDER FIRE AGAIN",
      "A new Mad Max speed profile is now included in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving interface. (Tesla)",
      "History of Tesla's Mad Max mode since 2018",
      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",
      "Tesla\u2019s speed-profile menu includes the toggle options of Chill, Standard, Hurry, and Mad Max profiles to customize how aggressively their car responds in traffic.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Mike Blake)",
      "If you share the road with Teslas, it's smart to stay alert. Vehicles using Mad Max mode may accelerate or change lanes more quickly than expected. Giving Teslas a little extra space can help reduce surprises and keep everyone safer on the road.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tesla's decision to reintroduce Mad Max mode is both strategic and provocative. It revives a feature from its early Autopilot days while reigniting debate over the balance between innovation and responsibility. The mode's return reminds everyone that Tesla continues to test the limits of driver-assist technology and public tolerance for it.",

      "10 tips to protect yourself from phishing emails",
      "Phishing scams that mimic real companies like American Express can slip into your inbox looking almost legitimate. The best way to stay safe is to create strong digital habits that protect your information and your peace of mind. Here are the top ways to defend yourself against phishing threats and financial fraud.",
      "Adding two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) creates an extra layer of protection. Even if a scammer gets your password through a fake American Express email, they cannot access your account without your verification code. Most banks and credit card companies offer this free feature in their security settings. Enable it today and make your login stronger.",
      "Data removal services help clean up your personal information from data broker websites that collect and sell your details to advertisers, marketers and even scammers. Reducing your digital footprint limits the amount of information that phishing attackers can use to make fake emails look convincing. In the case of fake American Express messages, less personal data online means fewer details criminals can use to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Outdated browsers and antivirus programs leave gaps that scammers can exploit. Regular updates close those gaps and strengthen your defense against phishing links and malicious downloads. Set your software to update automatically so you are always protected when opening emails or clicking links.",
      "Make it a habit to log into your credit card accounts directly from the official website, not from email links. Scan your statements for unfamiliar transactions. Early detection helps you report fraud fast and recover funds before more damage is done.",
      "Phishing emails thrive on urgency. Before clicking, take a deep breath and ask yourself: Does this message feel pressured or suspicious? Instead of clicking \"verify now,\" open a new browser tab and visit the official credit card website to check your account. This one simple pause can stop a scam in its tracks.",
      "Good antivirus software not only blocks viruses but also warns you when a site or email is unsafe. Choose a program that includes phishing detection, real-time web protection and email scanning. These tools can automatically block fraudulent look-alike emails before you even open them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Identity monitoring services keep watch over the dark web and alert you if your personal information, such as your email address, password, or credit card number, appears in stolen data. If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company's official fraud department and delete it immediately.",
      "If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information.",
      "If an email feels wrong, it probably is. Your intuition is one of your strongest defenses against scams. Combine it with these habits to stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your personal and financial information safe.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Phishing scams are becoming more advanced, but your awareness is your best defense. When you know how to spot fake emails and stay calm under pressure, you protect both your money and your peace of mind. So next time you get an \"urgent\" message about your account, ask yourself: Would your bank really contact you this way?",

      "When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real.",
      "The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf.",

      "Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm.",
      "The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice.",
      "Is ClothOff still available?",
      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from payroll and phishing scams",
      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Scammers often send emails that look like they come from your HR department or university leadership, warning about payroll, benefits or urgent issues. Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Add an extra layer of security by enabling\u00a02FA on all accounts that support it. This means even if someone steals your password, they still can't log in without a second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone.",
      "Even if you follow all precautions, it's smart to monitor your accounts for any unusual activity. Catching unauthorized transactions quickly can prevent bigger losses and alert you to potential scams before they escalate.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing. The scale and sophistication of these attacks highlight how vulnerable even well-established institutions can be to financially motivated threat actors.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Spotify is rolling out a major update for parents who want more control over what their children listen to. Managed accounts, first tested in select countries, are now expanding to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, France and the Netherlands. These accounts create a safer and more personalized way for young listeners to enjoy music while parents stay in control of what plays.",

      "TEENS FACE NEW PG-13 LIMITS ON INSTAGRAM",
      "A safer way for kids to explore music",
      "Spotify's new managed accounts are built for kids under 13. They offer a music-only experience inside the main Spotify app. Parents can use their Family Plan settings to filter explicit lyrics, block certain artists or songs and hide videos or looping visuals called Canvas. Unlike the limited Spotify Kids app, these accounts exist within the regular Spotify platform. Kids get a familiar interface with features like Discover Weekly and Daylist, but with restrictions that fit their age.",
      "Parents can now guide what their kids listen to while enjoying music together on Spotify. (Spotify)",
      "How managed accounts work",
      "Premium Family subscribers can set up a managed account directly from their Spotify settings. Choose\u00a0\"Add a Member,\" then select \"Add a listener aged under 13.\" Parents control what content plays, while kids build their own playlists and get personalized recommendations based on their listening habits. This separation keeps parents' Discover Weekly and Wrapped playlists clean from unexpected surprises like a sudden obsession with gaming soundtracks or silly meme songs.",

      "Managed accounts make family streaming safer, simpler and more personalized for young listeners. (Spotify)",
      "Why this matters for parents",
      "For years, parents have struggled to give kids music freedom while keeping explicit content away. This update finally solves that challenge. Managed accounts let parents turn off videos, block podcasts and make sure no age-restricted content slips through. It provides peace of mind for families who love streaming music together.",
      "Kids get their own playlists and recommendations without changing what parents hear. (Spotify)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you already subscribe to the Premium Family plan, this update adds even more value. You still get six individual accounts, and now you can include a customized child account. Parents can share their favorite songs safely while using filters that protect young listeners. Kids get the freedom to explore new music and create playlists without affecting the main account's recommendations.",

      "What is WEEX?",
      "WEEX is a cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to trade digital assets, including gold-backed tokens like Tether Gold (XAUT). These aren't physical gold bars or coins; they're digital tokens tied to the price of gold and stored on blockchain networks. While WEEX operates as a legitimate platform, scammers often exploit the name of real exchanges to sound credible. They'll encourage victims to \"trade gold\" through what seems like an official account but actually directs them to fake sites or wallets designed to steal money.",
      "Why this could be a scam",
      "John's experience shows several red flags. The conversation began with a friendly invitation, then quickly shifted to a financial pitch. That's a classic move in online relationship scams. The younger person builds an emotional connection, then uses that trust to promote an \"opportunity.\" Scammers often promise guaranteed profits or claim they'll \"help you trade\" to make the process sound easy.",
      "But the truth is, once you send money or crypto, it's nearly impossible to get it back. Even if WEEX itself is legitimate, the person encouraging you to use it may not be.",

      "Scammers use friendly conversations to build trust before asking for money. Stay alert. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to tell if you're being targeted",
      "You can spot trouble early by asking simple questions. If someone can't explain how the investment works or avoid details about how to withdraw your money, that's a warning sign. Be cautious if they promise fast profits or \"zero-risk\" returns.",
      "Real investments always involve risk. Watch out for anyone who pressures you to act quickly or says the deal is \"private.\" Those urgency tactics are designed to keep you from thinking clearly.",
      "Also, look up the company behind the platform. If it's based overseas, lacks clear business registration or hides its address, your funds may have no legal protection.",

      "Never send money, crypto or gift cards to anyone you've only met by text. Ask for written proof explaining how the investment works and how withdrawals happen. If the person avoids details or insists you \"act now,\" that's a serious warning sign.",
      "Scammers thrive on vague promises. Ask specific questions about how profits are made, how you'll access your funds and who regulates the platform. If the answers are unclear or the topic changes, walk away immediately.",
      "Before you invest a cent, search online for phrases like \"WEEX scam\" or \"WEEX complaints.\" See what other users have experienced and whether any regulatory agencies have flagged the platform. Real investors leave detailed feedback; scammers usually don't.",
      "Protect your privacy beyond just this scam. Data removal services can erase your personal details from data broker sites that sell your info to marketers and sometimes scammers. The fewer places your data lives online, the harder it is for fraudsters to find and target you again.",

It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "How to report a scam",
      "If you believe you've been targeted by a WEEX gold scam or any similar text-based investment scheme, take action right away. Start by reporting the scam to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. This helps investigators track new fraud patterns and warn others.",

Older adults are particularly vulnerable, especially when the scam feels personal. By blending romance with financial advice, these criminals make their victims believe they're building both trust and wealth. Protect yourself by treating every unexpected text with caution. If the conversation moves toward money, crypto, or gold trading, that's your cue to stop responding.

      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",

Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:04:55 -0400",
    "summary": "House Bill 469 would prevent AI systems from owning property, serving as executives, or gaining legal personhood in Ohio under Representative Thaddeus Claggett&apos;s proposal.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "An Ohio lawmaker is taking aim at artificial intelligence in a way few expected. Rep. Thaddeus Claggett has introduced House Bill 469, which would make it illegal for AI systems to be treated like people. The proposal would officially label them as\u00a0\"nonsentient entities,\" cutting off any path toward legal personhood.",
      "And yes, it also includes a ban on marrying AI.",
      "Claggett, a Republican from Licking County and chair of the House Technology and Innovation Committee, said the measure is meant to keep humans firmly in control of machines. He says that as AI systems begin to act more like humans, the law must draw a clear line between person and program.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",

      "What Ohio's AI marriage ban would do",
      "Under the proposed legislation, AI systems would not be able to own property, manage bank accounts or serve as company executives. They would not have the same rights or responsibilities as people. The bill also makes any marriage between a human and an AI, or between two AI systems, legally impossible.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "Claggett believes the concern is not about robot weddings happening anytime soon. Instead, he wants to prevent AI from taking on the legal powers of a spouse, such as holding power of attorney or making financial and medical decisions for someone else.",
      "The bill also specifies that if an AI causes harm, the human owners or developers would be responsible. That means a person cannot blame their chatbot or automated system for mistakes or damage. Responsibility stays with the humans who built, trained or used the system.",
      "Why Ohio is taking action on AI personhood",
      "The timing of the bill is not random. AI is spreading fast across nearly every industry. Systems now write reports, generate artwork and analyze complex data at lightning speed. Ohio has even started requiring schools to create rules for AI use in classrooms. And major data centers are being built to power AI infrastructure in the state.",
      "At the same time, AI is becoming more personal. A survey by Florida-based marketing firm Fractl found that 22 percent of users said they had formed emotional connections with a chatbot. Three percent even considered one a romantic partner. Another 16 percent said they wondered whether the AI they were talking to was sentient.",
      "That kind of emotional attachment raises red flags for lawmakers. If people start believing AI has feelings or intent, it blurs the boundaries between human experience and digital simulation.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (iStock)",
      "AI COMPANIONS REPLACE REAL FRIENDS FOR MANY TEENS",
      "The bigger picture: Keeping humans in control",
      "Claggett said the bill is about protecting human agency. He believes that as AI grows smarter and more capable, it must never replace the human decision-maker.",
      "Claggett told CyberGuy, \"We see AI as having tremendous potential as a tool, but also tremendous potential to cause harm. We want to prevent that by establishing guardrails and a legal framework before these developments can outpace regulation and bad actors start exploiting legal loopholes. We want the human to be liable for any misconduct, and for there to be no question regarding the legal status of AI, no matter how sophisticated, in Ohio law.\"",
      "The proposed law would also reinforce that AI cannot make choices that affect human lives without oversight.",
      "If passed, it would ensure that no machine can act independently in matters of marriage, property, or corporate leadership. Supporters see the bill as a safeguard for society, arguing that technology should never gain the same legal footing as people.",
      "Critics, however, say the proposal might be a solution to a problem that doesn't yet exist. They warn that overly broad restrictions could slow down AI research and innovation in Ohio.",
      "Still, even skeptics admit that the conversation is necessary. AI is evolving faster than most laws can keep up, and questions about rights, ownership and accountability are becoming harder to ignore.",
      "What other states are doing about AI personhood",
      "Ohio isn't alone in pushing back against AI personhood. In Utah, lawmakers passed H.B. 249, the Utah Legal Personhood Amendments, which prohibits courts and government entities from recognizing legal personhood for nonhuman entities, including AI. The law also bars recognizing personhood for entities such as bodies of water, land and plants.",
      "In Missouri, legislators introduced H.B. 1462, the \"AI Non-Sentience and Responsibility Act,\" which would formally declare AI systems non-sentient and prevent them from acquiring legal status, marriage rights, corporate roles or property ownership.",
      "AI-GENERATED ATTORNEY OUTRAGES JUDGE WHO SCOLDS MAN OVER COURTROOM FAKE: \u2018NOT A REAL PERSON\u2019",
      "In Idaho, H.B. 720 (2022) includes language that reserves legal rights and personhood for human beings, effectively barring personhood claims by nonhumans, including AI.",
      "These measures reflect a broader trend among state governments. Many legislators are trying to get ahead of AI's development by setting clear legal boundaries before the technology becomes more advanced.",
      "Taken together, these proposals show that Ohio's effort is part of a larger national movement to define where technology ends and legal personhood begins.",
      "House Bill 469 aims to keep humans in control as AI becomes more lifelike. (XPENG)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Ohio, House Bill 469 could influence how you use and interact with artificial intelligence. It sets clear boundaries that keep AI as a tool rather than a person. By keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands, the law aims to avoid confusion about who is accountable when technology fails. If an AI system causes harm or makes an error, the responsibility stays with the humans who designed or deployed it.",
      "For Ohio businesses, this proposal could lead to real changes in daily operations. Companies that depend on AI to handle customer support, financial decisions, or creative projects may need to review how much authority those systems have. It may also require stricter policies to ensure that a human is always supervising important decisions involving money, health, or law. Lawmakers want to keep people firmly in charge of choices that affect others.",
      "For everyday users, the message is straightforward. AI can be useful, but it cannot replace human relationships or legal rights. This bill reinforces that no matter how human-like technology appears, it cannot form genuine emotional or legal bonds with people. Conversations with chatbots might feel personal, but they remain simulations created through data and programming.",
      "DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH",
      "For people outside Ohio, this proposal could point to what is coming next. Other states are closely watching how the bill develops, and some may adopt similar laws. If it passes, it could set a national example for defining the legal limits of artificial intelligence. What happens in Ohio may shape how courts, businesses and individuals across the country decide to manage their connection to AI in the years ahead.",
      "In the end, this debate is not limited to one state. It raises an important question about how society should balance the power of innovation with the need to protect human control.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ohio's House Bill 469 is bold, controversial and timely. It challenges us to define the limits of what technology should be allowed to do. Claggett's proposal is not about stopping innovation. It's about ensuring that as machines become more capable, humans remain in charge of the choices that shape society. The debate is far from over. Some see this as a necessary safeguard, while others believe it underestimates what AI can contribute. But one thing is certain: Ohio has thrown a spotlight on one of the biggest questions of our time.",

      "While speaking to reporters in Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was open to working with the United Nations, but not its agency for Palestinians known as UNRWA.",
      "As the fragile ceasefire in Gaza holds, a new idea to divide the Strip into two areas is gaining traction. On one side would be life under Hamas\u2019s grip. On the other, a vision of what life would be like without the terror group.",

      "The areas currently under Israeli control behind the so-called \"yellow line\" make up roughly 58% of the Gaza Strip, including all of Rafah in the south, large parts of Khan Younis and northern neighborhoods such as Beit Lahia and Shujaiyya.

We called it Disneyland because we wanted it to look like hope \u2014 like the future.\"",
      "He said the idea follows the \"clear, hold, build\" model used in Iraq and Afghanistan, where troops secured neighborhoods one by one.",
      "\"In Ramadi, we did it neighborhood by neighborhood until we covered the whole city,\" he said. \"You hold it, clear it, let the locals take over. It\u2019s historically proven. You don\u2019t have to rid Gaza of Hamas to start this.\"",

      "\"We are approaching a new reality in which it\u2019s feasible for reconstruction to begin in a portion of the Strip \u2014 the areas behind the yellow line \u2014 while fighting continues in the rest of Gaza,\" Braude said. \"Hamas is not a party to the peace process but a belligerent actor. Reconstruction is not contingent on Hamas\u2019 cooperation. It begins where Hamas can no longer operate, while the effort to eliminate its presence continues in other parts of the Strip.\"",
      "Braude said the plan envisions \"nascent enclaves of self-rule that gradually evolve into a coalition \u2014 the foundation for what could be called a Gazan Interim Transitional Authority.\"",
      "He concluded, \"Developing local fighting forces to counter Hamas is a capacity Gazans welcome and Israel and its allies have,\" he said. \"Building a functioning government with continuity, a rules-based system, and institutions \u2014 that\u2019s the harder work.\"",

      "\u201cThis quarter, our U.S. business was again challenged by industry-wide shifts in retailer ordering patterns,\u201d CEO Ynon Kreiz said on Mattel\u2019s recent earnings call. \u201cThat said, consumer demand for our products grew in every region, including in the U.S.\u201d",
      "During the most recent quarter, which ended Sept. 30, Mattel said sales slipped 6% globally, led by a 12% decline in North America. International sales rose 3%.",
      "Some of the company\u2019s top performing categories included Hot Wheels and action figures, primarily from the \u201cJurassic World,\u201d Minecraft and WWE franchises.",
      "Other Mattel brands saw a drop in sales, however, including Barbie and Fisher-Price.",
      "With retail stores waiting until the last minute to assess the level of tariffs that would apply to their holiday orders, Kreiz said \u201csince the beginning of the fourth quarter, orders from retailers in the U.S. have accelerated significantly.\u201d",
      "Retailers \u201cexpect strong demand for the holiday and they are restocking,\u201d he added.",

      "Key drivers of that included \u201cPeppa Pig\u201d and Marvel franchise toys, as well as the Wizards of the Coast games.",
      "Hasbro \u201cmanaged tariff volatility with agility\u201d and used price hikes to protect its margins, said Gina Goetter, the company\u2019s chief financial officer and chief operating officer.",

      "For its part, Hasbro also saw \u201csoftness\u201d in the U.S. during the quarter due to retail chains waiting longer to place holiday orders, but said momentum is accelerating as the season gets underway.",
      "In July, Mattel\u2019s chief financial officer, Paul Ruh, said that the company was raising prices because of tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe have implemented a variety of actions that will help us withstand some of those headwinds and those include \u2026 supply chain efficiencies and some pricing adjustments, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d Ruh said on the company\u2019s earnings conference call.",
      "\u201cSo with that array of actions, we\u2019re able to withstand some of the uncertainty that is mostly coming in the top line,\u201d Ruh said. \u201cOur goal is to keep prices as low as possible for our consumers.\u201d",
      "Still, Kreiz said that \u201cconsumers are buying our products and the toy industry is growing.\u201d",
      "He also said that consumers are taking price hikes in stride and those increases haven\u2019t hurt demand: \u201cWe are not seeing any slowdown in consumer demand so far.\u201d",
      "Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said the company has also raised some prices, but it was \u201cpretty surgical\u201d in what it chose to adjust.",
      "\u201cIn terms of ongoing pricing, I think we just kind of have to see how the holiday goes and the consumer holds up,\u201d he told analysts on the company\u2019s earnings call.",
      "Cocks also cautioned that there may be a two-tier economy forming, something other executives and economists have observed in recent months.",
      "\u201cRight now, I think it\u2019s really kind of a tale of two consumers. The top 20%, particularly in the U.S., continue to spend pretty robustly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe balance of households are watching their wallets a bit more.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department released the latest consumer price index data, which showed that inflation is rising at a 3% annual pace, up from August\u2019s 2.9%.",
      "In May, Kreiz told CNBC that approximately half of the company\u2019s toys were sourced from China.",

    "summary": "The administration plans to replace ICE regional leaders to intensify its deportations effort amid",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is planning to replace some regional leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement with Border Patrol officials in an attempt to intensify its mass deportations effort amid growing frustration with the pace of daily arrests, according to two Homeland Security Department officials, one former DHS official and one federal law enforcement official.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top aides have welcomed Border Patrol\u2019s more aggressive tactics to secure arrests, such as rappeling into apartment buildings from Black Hawk helicopters and jumping out of rental trucks in Home Depot parking lots, as they\u2019ve become disappointed with ICE, the officials said.",
      "\u201cThe mentality is CBP does what they\u2019re told, and the administration thinks ICE isn\u2019t getting the job done,\u201d one of the DHS officials said. \u201cSo CBP will do it.\u201d",
      "The White House has signed off on a list of at least a dozen directors of ICE field officers who are set to be reassigned in coming days, the two DHS officials, the former DHS official and the federal law enforcement official said. They said that at least half of them would be replaced with Border Patrol officials. ICE has 25 field offices around the country, so the move could replace nearly half of the agency\u2019s leaders.",
      "The list was compiled by Corey Lewandowski, a special government employee at DHS who advises Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol sector chief overseeing the agency\u2019s operations in Chicago and previously in Los Angeles, the law enforcement official said.",
      "The administration\u2019s shift to leaning more heavily on Border Patrol marks a potential new phase in Trump\u2019s deportation efforts. While ICE has come under criticism for its raids, the agency\u2019s broad approach has been to make targeted arrests of immigrants known to be in the country illegally. Border Patrol\u2019s approach to recent arrests in major U.S. cities has been more aggressive, making large sweeps that have sparked some of the sharpest backlash from protesters and prompted lawsuits.",
      "The New York Times was first to report that the Trump administration was planning a shake-up of ICE leadership amid frustration over arrest numbers, citing three people familiar with the plans.",
      "As of late September, the latest period for which data is available due to the government shutdown, ICE was arresting 1,178 on average per day \u2014 well short of the 3,000 per day that the chief architect of Trump\u2019s deportation policy, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, has demanded.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Asked about any plans to reassign ICE leaders, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, \u201cThe president\u2019s entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President\u2019s policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "Border Patrol has deployed over 1,500 agents to arrest immigrants in cities around the country to assist with deportations, Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks told NBC News. By comparison, there are 8,500 officers working for ICE\u2019s enforcement and removal operations.",
      "Border Patrol has been behind some of the most searing images of immigration arrests since Trump took office. Earlier this month in Chicago, Border Patrol agents rappeled from a Black Hawk helicopter into an apartment building as families slept. Last week, videos emerged from Chicago of Bovino throwing a gas canister into a crowd.",
      "The incident is now part of a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of using overly aggressive tactics.",
      "Bovino has been ordered before a federal judge in Illinois on Tuesday to face questions on whether recent arrest tactics in the Chicago area, including using tear gas, violated a temporary restraining order against CBP\u2019s use of excessive force. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have pointed to Bovino\u2019s personal use of tear gas as a potential violation of the judge\u2019s order.",
      "DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said Monday in a statement to NBC News that Bovino had been hit in the head by a rock. \"We look forward to the American people viewing the footage,\" she said.",
      "Some ICE leaders have quietly expressed dismay over Border Patrol\u2019s tactics in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, the law enforcement official and two DHS officials said.",
      "Two former ICE officials said ICE does not own some of the resources Border Patrol has, such as Black Hawks.",
      "The White House\u2019s frustration with ICE has been building for months.",
      "In mid-May, Miller told ICE\u2019s leaders that if he they did not start arresting 3,000 immigrants per day, he would see that the leaders of the lowest performing regions were taken out of their positions, according to two people who spoke with meeting attendees.",

      "The Trump administration has increasingly turned to Bovino to oversee Border Patrol operations targeting immigrants in major U.S. cities, most recently in Chicago, where Bovino arrived in mid-October and became the public face of the Trump administration\u2019s enforcement efforts there.",
      "The DHS officials said Bovino does not report to the chief of Border Patrol or CBP\u2019s commissioner, as other Border Patrol sector chiefs do. The law enforcement official said Bovino reports directly to Noem, who called him the Border Patrol Commander at Large in a recent op-ed.",
      "While the list of ICE field office directors that may soon be removed was compiled by Lewandowski and Bovino, it also is being tightly held inside the White House by Miller, the DHS officials said.",
      "The officials did not know the names of the individuals on the list but said they\u2019re expected to be directors whose regions are underperforming in arrest numbers or those who have pushed back on some of the more aggressive tactics that Miller supports and Border Patrol has conducted."

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 18:49:02 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump looms over the New Jersey governor's race. But the results will also be tied to how voters in New Jersey view another politician: Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.",
    "story": [
      "Recent public polling in the New Jersey governor\u2019s race has shown Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill leading Republican Jack Ciattarelli by varying degrees. Like many campaigns in the last decade, President Donald Trump and voter perceptions of his performance have loomed over this race.",
      "But Sherrill\u2019s lead also appears to be tied to how voters in New Jersey view another politician: Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.",
      "Polls conducted in recent weeks have not tested Murphy\u2019s job approval rating, but a Fox News survey conducted Oct. 10-14 found 47% of voters had a favorable view of the two-term governor, while 49% had an unfavorable view of him. Sherrill led Ciattarelli in that survey by 5 points, within the poll\u2019s margin of error.",
      "In the handful of public polls that did test Murphy\u2019s job approval during the fall campaign, the three surveys that showed Murphy with an approval rating in the high 40s also saw Sherrill build bigger leads. In two surveys putting Murphy\u2019s job approval at 35%, including one that was conducted for Ciattarelli\u2019s campaign, the gubernatorial results showed a tied or near-tied race \u2014 the best results Ciattarelli has enjoyed in the whole campaign.",
      "The shift depending on Murphy\u2019s approval rating underscores how views of the current two-term administration could be a key factor in the race.",
      "Ciattarelli has tied Sherrill to Murphy and cast himself as the candidate representing change in the race, placing blame for the state\u2019s woes on Murphy and Democrats, who control the state Legislature.",
      "\u201cPoliticians like Mikie Sherrill and Phil Murphy just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Ciattarelli says in one recent TV ad. \u201cThey\u2019re making New Jersey unaffordable, especially for the middle class. We need a change.\u201d",
      "Sherrill, meanwhile, has also put some distance between herself and Murphy on the issue of the state\u2019s rising electricity costs, while also casting herself as a candidate who will bring change to state government.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, I\u2019ll also fight Trenton to bring down costs for families,\u201d Sherrill said in a recent debate.",
      "Five recent publicly released surveys, all of them conducted in September, measured both Murphy\u2019s standing and the governor\u2019s race in New Jersey.",
      "A Fox News survey and a poll from the education group Yes Every Kid both found Sherrill up 7 points, with support from 48% of respondents, while a Quinnipiac survey from mid-September found Sherrill up 8 points, at 49%. Sherrill\u2019s lead in the Fox News survey was outside the poll\u2019s 3-point margin of error, while her leads in the other two surveys were just inside those margins of error.",
      "Murphy\u2019s approval rating in those three polls: 47% or 48%.",
      "The outlier so far among independent surveys has been one from Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill, which showed the race tied, with both Sherrill and Ciattarelli at 43%, within the survey\u2019s margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 points.",
      "Beyond the top-line results, a key difference separating the Emerson poll from others was Murphy\u2019s approval rating, which that poll measured at 35%, more than 10 points lower than the other surveys.",
      "As polls show different pictures of Murphy\u2019s approval rating, Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained in the low 40s, with each of the September surveys finding Trump\u2019s approval at 41%.",
      "Sherrill has tried to capitalize on that in her advertising, linking Trump to Ciattarelli, who has the president\u2019s endorsement. Democrats are betting that voters\u2019 opposition to Trump will drive them to the polls in November and boost Sherrill in the race. Ciattarelli, meanwhile, has largely praised the president while also brushing off Democratic attacks by arguing that Trump does not affect local issues like property taxes.",
      "Meanwhile, both candidates were asked in a recent debate to grade Murphy\u2019s administration, and Sherrill gave the two-term governor a B.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s things like paying for the pensions, the nine increases in our credit rating that I like,\u201d Sherrill said.",
      "\u201cBut overall I think there\u2019s ways Trenton could do a lot better, being much more responsive to people. I\u2019m going to have a culture shift in Trenton. I\u2019m going to make sure we have more accountability in government, driving down costs for people,\u201d Sherrill added, also calling for more action to address housing costs and rail infrastructure.",
      "Ciattarelli gave Murphy an F, calling Murphy\u2019s tenure \u201cthe worst governorship of our lifetime.\u201d",
      "\u201cTake a look at what\u2019s happened in New Jersey. We have an affordability crisis because of property taxes, electricity rate, housing and child care. We have a public education crisis because we watered down the public school curriculum. We have a public safety crisis because we don\u2019t let our local police do their jobs. And we have an overdevelopment crisis in our suburban communities because of high-density housing. It\u2019s been a failure across the board,\u201d Ciattarelli said.",
      "Wherever Murphy\u2019s approval rating is, his standing appears to be significantly better than former GOP Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s after his two terms in office.",
      "A Fox News survey conducted in October 2017 found 21% of New Jersey voters viewed Christie favorably, while 77% viewed him unfavorably. The survey did not test Christie\u2019s job approval."

    "summary": "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests",
    "story": [
      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d"

      "Alongside anchors Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Dylan Dreyer, three chefs make their dishes from the \u201cTODAY Loves Food\u201d cookbook.

      "\u201cMy mother has said the same thing. But, listen, I\u2019ll try anything,\u201d he says, adding that not everything is for everyone. \u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten better.\u201d",
      "Sheinelle says she\u2019s taken home food from the show that she really enjoyed, but it\u2019s not always a hit with her kids.",

      "But the easiest way to tell if an anchor enjoyed the dish is to take a look at their plate at the end of the segment. If it\u2019s empty, it was a hit.",

      "\u201cAnd then my mom\u2019s texting me after, \u2018Was that really as good as you made it sound? Should I try that recipe?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Yes, you have to try that recipe.\u2019\u201d"

Meanwhile Clara, heartbroken by the death of her father and aunt, embarks on a relationship with Miller (Mason Thames), a boy from her school.",

Eventually, it's revealed that when they were teenagers, Jonah had asked Morgan if \"they had it wrong,\" implying he thought he and Morgan were supposed to be together, instead of Morgan and Chris, and Jenny and Jonah.",
      "Does Clara Find out About the Affair?",
      "One of the first scenes of the movie establishes the close relationship between Clara and her aunt Jenny. While running late for family dinner, Clara calls Jenny to tell her a story about Miller, a boy from school who later becomes her boyfriend. She ends the call by saying, \"Don't tell my mom.\"",
      "Their mother-daughter relationship is also strained by Clara\u2019s dreams of studying acting, which Morgan doesn\u2019t believe is a responsible choice.",

      "When Clara arrives home one evening and walks in on Morgan and Jonah sharing their first kiss, she storms into her room upset. Unaware of their shared history, Clara assumes that her mom and her aunt's fianc\u00e9 had moved on.",
      "Clara avoids her mother for a few days, until one morning when Morgan helps her overcome a hangover. As they are sitting at the kitchen table, Morgan finally reveals to Clara that Chris and Jenny had been having an affair.",

      "After the film, Morgan pulls Clara aside to say she supports her dream to study acting in college, despite her initial doubts. Morgan tells Clara she has an incredible talent, and that she will be able to succeed. The mother and daughter finally embrace."

While we\u2019re always rooting for our participants to find a lifelong commitment \u2014 because that\u2019s what they all say they come to 'Love is Blind' for \u2014 most importantly, we root for them to make the decisions they feel are right for themselves.

What was different about \"Traitors\" is \"Traitors\" brought people from outside of the competitive reality world together.

But also, through social media and text, I talk to Ciara once in a while.",

Before I write it, I want to continue the journey, because I feel like there's more and there's an evolution which is wild. This show that I went on 25 years ago to where we are now and to where we're going. I think we're going to wait a little bit to see the amendments and the next version.",

I've done everything that I wanted to do, and I have so much love and respect for that show. That's where I started, that will always be my home. That's always a part of how I got to where I am. So no shade at all.",
      "I just feel like I've done it so many times. I have such a big target and reputation now, if I go back out there like they might let me last a little bit, but nobody's going to let me get to the end. So why not give somebody else an opportunity that needs another chance. And that's what I told Jeff way back when ... with the precursor, that if you guys absolutely tell me you need me, I will be there because they've done so much for me over the course of my life.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 14:01:57 GMT",
    "summary": "The Burevestnik is a nuclear-powered, nuclear-capable cruise missile announced in 2018 by Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
    "story": [
      "Russia says it has successfully tested an experimental weapon that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: a nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range, whose low-flying, terrain-hugging and loitering capabilities could evade American missile defenses and drop atomic bombs anywhere on Earth.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",
      "The development has drawn concern internationally, with President Donald Trump saying Monday it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to be conducting such tests when Russia should be focusing on peace talks with Ukraine.",
      "But many Western experts have questioned the value of the missile, which is code-named \u201cSkyfall\u201d by NATO. Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",
      "\u201cThe main reason that no one else has tried to build something like this is that it doesn\u2019t really have any use,\u201d Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told NBC News.",
      "The weapon is instead \u201clargely political,\u201d according to Podvig, who is based in Geneva and runs the Russian Nuclear Forces Project. \u201cIt was important for the Kremlin, I think, that this is unique and something no one else has done before.\u201d",
      "Trump pointed out Monday that there are other ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.",
      "\u201cWe have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One. So a missile \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go 8,000 miles,\u201d he added.",
      "\"We test missiles all the time,\" he said. \"They're not playing games with us, and we're not playing games with them either.\"",
      "The Kremlin said it saw no reason why the test would \u201cstrain relations between Moscow and Washington,\u201d already complicated by the shelved Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm. Nils Andreas Stensoenes, head of Norway\u2019s Intelligence Service, told Reuters in an emailed statement.",
      "The missile is a so-called second strike weapon, designed to be part of Russia\u2019s response to a nuclear attack. But any such assault on Moscow\u2019s military sites would likely target the Burevestnik\u2019s launch pads, too, Podvig and others believe. It would also likely be detected during its long flight, he said.",
      "He and others read this week's announcement as more of a political response to Trump\u2019s plans for a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system in the U.S.",
      "Others see Putin's announcement as a response to sanctions this month by the European Union and Trump.",
      "Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did little to disabuse this idea when asked about it during his daily news briefing Monday.",
      "\"Ensuring security is a vital issue for Russia, especially given the militaristic sentiment we are currently hearing primarily from Europeans,\" he said.",
      "\"Despite all our openness to establishing a dialogue with the United States, Russia, first of all, and the president of Russia, is guided by our own national interests,\" Peskov added.",
      "Some observers, such as Fabian Hoffmann, a doctoral research fellow at the Oslo Nuclear Project, part of Norway's University of Oslo, were not too concerned.",
      "\u201cI celebrate every ruble Russia invests in this useless and unnecessary missile,\u201d he posted to X."

      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Melissa is set to make landfall in Jamaica sometime Tuesday before moving across southeastern Cuba on Wednesday, its force diminished by tripping over land, and then heading across the southeastern Bahamas on Wednesday night, deflating to a Category 2 storm, U.S. forecasters said.",
      "Jamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned residents Monday to take the threat of the storm seriously, particularly young people who may be unaware of what a strong hurricane can do.",
      "\u201cWe urge persons to stay inside, stay within the precincts of your home,\u201d Holness said.",
      "Three people have died in Jamaica while preparing for the hurricane, all related to the felling of trees, the country's Minister of Health and Wellness Christopher Tufton said Monday.",
      "At 11 p.m. ET, the Category 5 storm was moving north-northeast at 2 mph, and its center was 150 miles southwest of Jamaica's capital, Kingston, the hurricane center said.",
      "\"After remaining nearly stationary over the past few hours, Melissa now appears to be moving slowly north-northeastward,\" the center said in a forecast discussion Monday.",
      "The storm's minimum central pressure, a measure closely tied to its strength, was 903 millibars, which indicates rare power. Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, was 920 millibars \u2014 weaker than Melissa.",
      "The storm's stalling has pushed back the arrival of Melissa's core over Jamaica, eastern Cuba and the Central Bahamas, though it should be past them all as later this week, forecasters said.",
      "Late Monday, Melissa still whipped out maximum sustained winds of 175 mph, sometimes greater, putting it in the highest and most dangerous category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, the hurricane center said.",
      "The most powerful storm to hit the region since Hurricane Gilbert in 1988, Melissa will bring between 15 and 30 inches \u2014 and up to 40 inches \u2014 of rain to Jamaica, as well as extreme winds, extensive infrastructure damage and life-threatening storm surge along its southern coast, the hurricane center said.",
      "It's the third Category 5 of the 2025 season. The last time a single storm season saw more than two storms of this strength was 20 years ago, in 2005. Melissa is also the latest Category 5 storm in an Atlantic hurricane season in 27 years, since Hurricane Mitch in 1998.",
      "Some areas of eastern Jamaica could be inundated with up to 40 inches of rain, more than some areas of the country typically get in a year.",
      "Wind speeds in mountainous areas could be 30% higher than the main storm, meaning potential winds of more than 200 mph.",
      "Desmond Mackenzie, Jamaica\u2019s minister of local government and community development, said Sunday night that 218 people were already in some of the country's 881 shelters. As of Monday morning, all of the island's shelters were open, but many were still not full.",
      "Mackenzie said that many Jamaican communities \"will not survive this flooding.\"",
      "Jamaican residents were filling up gas canisters for their generators and boarding up windows to prepare for the intense wind and rain. Zookeepers in the capital city were relocating their animals ahead of the storm.",
      "An American tourist who caught one of the last flights from the island said there was a lot of turbulence getting back to the United States.",
      "\"It was almost like getting out and watching the rain come behind us,\" he said. \"But luckily we made it.\"",
      "Nicole Doyon, from Miami, was visiting the island for a yoga retreat, but couldn't get out before the storm despite exhausting all of her options.",
      "\"There was nothing available. At this point, there are no options,\" Doyon said.",
      "Haiti and the Dominican Republic will also face catastrophic and life-threatening flash flooding by midweek, the hurricane center said, while Cuba is facing heavy rain, floods and landslides. There is also a hurricane watch for the central and southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "The storm had killed at three people in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic as of Monday, officials said.",
      "Holness, the prime minister of Jamaica, said Monday that the government was \u201cas prepared as we can be\u201d as the storm approached. How long the storm spends over the country could raise the risk of destructive landslides.",
      "\u201cWe understand wind and rain and what it can do. But if it stays for a very long time, you\u2019re not just dealing with saturation, you\u2019re dealing with a high level of destruction,\u201d Holness said.",
      "The storm is forecast to move southeastern Cuba on Tuesdsay night, and across southeastern or central Bahamas on Wednesday, forecasters at the NHC said. Parts of both Cuba and the Bahamas were under hurricane warnings Monday."

      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d"

      "A major police operation has been underway to track down the thieves, who were captured fleeing on camera. But there was still no sign of the jewels themselves.",

    "story": [
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 President Donald Trump arrived in Malaysia on Sunday in his first stop on a three-country Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a highly anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as tensions between the world\u2019s two biggest economies tick higher.",
      "\u201cThe first message is Trump the peacemaker. The second is Trump the moneymaker,\u201d said Victor Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd then, of course, with the meeting with China, I think what everybody\u2019s expecting is that there\u2019s probably not going to be a big trade deal, but there will be an effort to de-escalate or put a pause on the situation.\u201d",
      "Trade is expected to dominate the week. Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said he would subsidize U.S. farmers if he did not reach a deal with China, and that he planned to discuss the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war with Xi, saying he\u2019d like to see China \u201chelp us out.\u201d",

      "In Kuala Lumpur, Trump is scheduled to meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim before attending a working dinner with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

      "Trump will also meet with business executives and visit American troops while in Japan, which hosts more U.S. service members than any other country in the world.",
      "Takaichi is a conservative protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Trump forged a close personal relationship during his first term.",
      "On Friday, she pledged to raise defense spending to 2% of GDP by March, two years ahead of schedule. The new target is likely to draw praise from Trump, who has pressed for allies to spend more.",

      "Topping the agenda at every stop is trade, with negotiators still ironing out the details of pacts with South Korea and Japan and taking steps toward agreements with China and Malaysia. U.S. and Chinese delegations were meeting in Malaysia over the weekend to find a way forward after Trump threatened new tariffs of 100% on Chinese goods and other trade limits starting Nov. 1 in response to China\u2019s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and related technologies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the U.S. president coming to Asia to meet the multilateral schedule; it\u2019s the U.S. president coming to Asia and then bending the multilateral schedule around his schedule,\u201d Cha said, noting that Trump is skipping the U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting, the East Asia Summit and formal APEC sessions.",
      "Even so, Cha said, regional leaders are eager to engage.",
      "\u201cEverybody still wants to cut a deal with the U.S. president,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all want tariff relief, and they will try to make a deal to achieve that.\u201d",
      "During the meeting with Xi, Trump said he plans to raise the issue of fentanyl, accusing China of failing to curb the flow of precursor chemicals, and a senior administration official said China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil will also be on the table. Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding that he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including China\u2019s halt to purchases of U.S. soybeans.",
      "Both leaders want the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the meeting planning said.",
      "But analysts urged caution about what a leader-level encounter can deliver.",

      "Earlier this week, a senior administration official pushed back on speculation that Trump could reprise his 2019 encounter with North Korea\u2019s Kim, when he made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas in an effort to revive nuclear talks that had collapsed. Trump said before leaving Washington on Friday that he \u201cwould like\u201d to meet with Kim, but was unsure whether it would happen on this trip.",

    "story": [
      "Russia reacted with outrage Thursday after the United States imposed substantial sanctions on its two largest oil companies, the first economic punishments slapped on Moscow by President Donald Trump during his second term.",
      "Experts said it remains to be seen, however, the extent to which this move may damage the Russian economy or Vladimir Putin\u2019s war machine, as Trump hopes to pressure Moscow to halt its assault on Ukraine.",
      "Days after canceling a planned summit with Putin, citing a lack of progress in the negotiations, Trump took the major step by effectively blacklisting Rosneft and Lukoil.",
      "The announcement was welcomed by Kyiv and its European allies, which added their own new raft of sanctions on Moscow, earning the ire of Russian officials and the state-controlled media.",
      "Speaking to journalists at the Kremlin on Thursday, Putin called the sanctions an \"unfriendly act\" but quickly brushed off their likely impact. \"They are serious in nature and will have certain consequences, but they will not have a significant impact on the health of our economy,\" he said.",
      "Putin added that sanctions on Russian oil could lead to \"a sharp increase\" in gas prices across the world, adding: \"If you take into account the domestic political calendar in the United States, it is clear how sensitive some processes would be. Those advising the current administration to adopt such measures should ask themselves whom they are really serving.\"",
      "The Russian leader said that he understood the U.S. wished to \"cancel or postpone\" the planned Budapest summit, adding that \"for both me and the U.S. president, it would be a mistake to approach this lightly and then walk away without the expected result.\"",
      "Hawkish ex-President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, was more forthright in his criticism of the Trump administration. \u201cThe USA is our adversary, and their loquacious \u2018peacemaker\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning Trump \u2014 \u201chas now fully taken up the path of war with Russia,\u201d Medvedev wrote in a social media post.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added in a news briefing: \u201cIf the current U.S. administration decides to follow the example of its predecessors, who tried to pressure or force Russia to abandon its national interests through illegitimate sanctions, the outcome will be exactly the same: a failure, both politically at home and harmful to global economic stability.\u201d",
      "The sanctions have been received in Russia as another flip-flop by Trump, who has tried to strong-arm both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at different times during his second term.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. president has changed his tune once again,\u201d wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, Putin\u2019s favorite newspaper. Another paper, Moskovskij Komsomolets, likened the U.S. president to a \u201cKolobok,\u201d a scheming bread bun from Slavic folklore.",
      "Trump has often expressed verbal frustration with Putin, accusing him of making positive diplomatic noises before bombing Ukrainian civilians again, but until now had avoided taking direct action.",
      "This week, he said that meeting with Putin would be a \"waste of time,\" after Russia rejected the American demand that a ceasefire come before talks.",
      "\u201cWe canceled the meeting with President Putin; it just didn\u2019t feel right to me,\u201d Trump said at a White House gathering of reporters. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we\u2019ll do it in the future.\u201d",
      "The sanctions drew praise from Ukraine and its supporters.",
      "\u201cWe waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said in Brussels.",
      "This is far from the first time that Russia has been punished like this. Under the administration of President Joe Biden, the U.S., along with the European Union and others, tried to squeeze Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors, attempting to isolate it from the global market.",
      "This did cause Russia some pain, with its oil and gas revenues declining after the initial measure introduced in 2022. However, it has been able to avoid the worst of it, with its 3.6% economic growth in 2024 outpacing even the U.S.\u2019 2.8%. It did this by increasing sales to China and India, and using its so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of vessels to carry exports in off-book moves.",
      "These ships were the target of new E.U. sanctions announced Thursday, which also sought to hit Russian energy and the ability of its diplomats to move freely in Europe.",
      "Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was bullish about Russia\u2019s ability to weather these moves, as it has done before.",
      "The measures \u201cwill not cause any particular difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to steadily strengthen its economic and energy potential.\u201d",
      "Western analysts said the picture was more nuanced.",
      "\"Russia is extremely skilled at avoiding the consequences of Western sanctions,\" Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a new threshold,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, NATO\u2019s former director of policy planning who is now the CEO of Rasmussen Global, a consultancy based in Copenhagen, Denmark. But \u201cthe Russian economy has shown its capacity to adapt and reposture itself, especially with Asian economies, starting with China and India.\u201d",
      "So that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said of the new sanctions, \u201cbut it means it\u2019s just putting more cost on Putin\u2019s actions. Whether the cost is going to be high enough for him to change, I doubt it. It will probably take more.\u201d",
      "Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden administration, called the U.S. sanctions a \u201cheartening move.\u201d Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, agreed in that \u201cthis is a big step.\u201d",
      "However, he and others said that success of the sanctions would depend on two things: How strictly the U.S. is willing and able to enforce them; and whether it decides to take any actions on other countries buying Russian energy, namely the two Asian giants propping up Moscow so far.",
      "\u201cThis won\u2019t seriously deprive Putin of his war dollars unless we sanction the eight refineries that buy the oil in China, India,\u201d said Bill Browder, an American-born investment fund manager and key Putin critic.",
      "\u201cTrump does not feel beholden in the same way that Biden was not touching third rails,\" said Bruen \u2014 using the \"third rail\" metaphor to describe Trump's willingness to grapple with previously \"untouchable\" foreign policy issues.",
      "\"And so if he is willing to use secondary sanctions, with more aggressive steps such as expanding the radius of where Ukraine can use Western weapons, all of that will mount pressure on Putin.\u201d",
      "Separately, two Russian aircraft flying from Kaliningrad violated Lithuanian airspace near Kybartai on Thursday, two Lithuanian officials told NBC News.",
      "A Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft and an IL-78 refueling aircraft flew into Lithuanian territory at about 700 meters and fled after having been in Lithuanian airspace for about 18 seconds, they said.",
      "Two Spanish fighters called Eurofighter Typhoons were dispatched as part of the NATO air police mission and flew to the site of the violation.",
      "The officials said the NATO air mission worked, and both praised their efforts. They also said Lithuanian government leaders are discussing a possible response.",
      "The Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires to protest the airspace violation. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Several European countries have in recent months accused Russia of violating their airspace with jets and drones as part of a broader effort to test NATO\u2019s military response measures. The Russian Defense Ministry has denied illegally violating European airspace."

      "Top U.S. officials have hit out at the Israeli parliament's move toward annexing the already occupied West Bank, labeling it an \u201cinsult\u201d that could damage Washington's efforts to keep the Gaza ceasefire on track and build toward a more lasting peace deal.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said Thursday that if the vote in the Knesset was a \u201cpolitical stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt, and I personally took some insult to it.\u201d Speaking with reporters, Vance called the vote \u201cweird\u201d and said, \u201cWe certainly weren\u2019t happy about it.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio separately warned Wednesday night as he prepared to depart for Israel that the Knesset's actions could imperil President Donald Trump's plan to end the conflict. Rubio was set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Thursday.",
      "A bill seeking to apply Israeli law to the West Bank, a move seen as amounting to annexation of the land that Palestinians view as part of a future state, gained preliminary approval from Israel\u2019s parliament earlier Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a vote in the Knesset, but obviously I think the president\u2019s made clear that\u2019s not something we\u2019d be supportive of right now,\u201d Rubio told reporters late Wednesday on the tarmac.",
      "Vance, meanwhile, maintained that \"the West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel,\" adding that that was the \"policy of the Trump administration\" and that it would \"continue to be our policy.\"",
      "In a statement after their comments, Netanyahu's office said Thursday that the vote was a \"deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord\" during Vance's visit to Israel.",
      "It said Netanyahu's Likud party did not vote for the bills, except for one \"disgruntled\" member who it said was recently fired from the chairmanship of a Knesset committee. \"Without Likud support these bills are unlikely to go anywhere,\" it said.",
      "Trump said weeks ago that he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. The vote was the first of four needed to pass the law, according to Reuters.",
      "Time magazine reported that Trump said in an interview over the phone last week that Israel \u201cwould lose all of its support\u201d from the United States if it annexed the West Bank.",
      "\"It won\u2019t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries,\" he said. \"It will not happen. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.\"",
      "Rubio was the latest U.S. official to make his way to Israel in recent days, on the heels of Vance, Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "On Wednesday, Vance sought to emphasize that U.S. officials were not flocking to Israel to babysit the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after a flare-up in violence raised fears the truce could collapse. He stressed that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions around the next steps in Trump\u2019s peace plan grew.",
      "Flashes of violence in Gaza in recent days have threatened to unravel the truce deal, with both Israel and Hamas trading accusations that the other side had violated the fragile ceasefire. The two sides also clashed over delays in returning hostage bodies held by Hamas and ongoing barriers to aid access in the enclave.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast War, and it has defended the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, but much of the international community views them as illegal.",
      "A rise in settler violence and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have been viewed as directly imperiling the Palestinian cause and as major impediments to resolving the decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex part of the world,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday. \u201cI think every day is going to bring opportunities and it\u2019s also going to bring some challenges, OK? We\u2019re dealing with decades and decades of this stuff.\u201d",
      "Despite warning of the impact the Knesset\u2019s moves toward annexation could have on peace efforts, Rubio still projected optimism over the future of the current ceasefire deal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more work to be done, and we know that,\u201d he said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis is a historic peace deal that President Trump delivered on, and now we have to make sure that it continues and that we continue to build upon it.\u201d"
