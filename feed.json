    "story": [
      "Lee Corso is set to retire from ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d on Saturday",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It is rare for a sports broadcasting figure to retire on his own terms or to be able to accept the tributes or adulation of colleagues and fans.",
      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",
      "Corso makes his final appearance as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d crew before No. 3 and reigning national champion Ohio State hosts top-ranked Texas.",
      "Since announcing his retirement earlier this year, Corso has received his share of acclaim and send-offs. He was honored at the ESPY Awards in July and received a standing ovation before boarding his flight in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show. We can be sad next week. But this weekend, we need to be celebrating him. Everything he\u2019s meant to us and to the sport.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turned 90 on Aug. 7, has been a part of \u201cGameDay\u201d since its start in 1987 and has made pregame shows entertaining under a simple philosophy: \u201cFootball is just the vehicle. It\u2019s entertainment, sweetheart.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",
      "GameDay\u2019s 26th appearance in Columbus also marks a full-circle moment for Corso. It was outside Ohio Stadium on Oct. 5, 1996, where Corso\u2019s popular headgear prediction segment began.",
      "Corso donned Brutus Buckeye\u2019s head before Ohio State faced Penn State, and the rest is history.",
      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the schedule, the obvious place was to try to go to Tallahassee, where he played (at Florida State), but this game is so big. The fact that it\u2019s a noon game. It became a no-brainer to have it here,\u201d Herbstreit said. \u201cIt is very kind of storybook. The fact that we started with this and and end it here in Columbus.\u201d",
      "Corso has a 66.5% winning rate on his headgear predictions (286-144), which is much better than his 73-85-6 mark in 15 years as a coach at Louisville, Indiana, and Northern Illinois.",
      "His final headgear pick will be on the field at Ohio Stadium. Besides airing across all of ESPN\u2019s networks, Fox Sports may show part of it. The final hour of both pregame shows will also take place in the Horseshoe.",
      "Tom Rinaldi and Chris Fallica \u2014 former GameDay crew members now with Fox Sports \u2014 are also expected to give their thoughts on Corso\u2019s retirement.",

      "The show took place at ESPN\u2019s studios in Bristol, Connecticut, until it went on the road for the first time in 1993, before Notre Dame hosted Florida State in a No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup. The show has been on the road regularly since 1995.",

      "Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said the beauty of Corso and \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d is that they allow fans to experience the flavor of being at a game at Texas or Alabama on television.",
      "\u201cCoach Corso was able to bring the aspect of a coach and a very analytical approach to the games being played, but then the entertainment and doing the headgear at the end of every show,\u201d Sarkesian said. \u201cI know that was something we all used to look forward to. What was he going to do? Like that was going to determine who would win the game or not, but that was the beauty of the show, getting people excited about every Saturday for college football.\u201d",
      "GameDay producer Jim Gaiero thinks Corso may still have a surprise or two for Saturday. No one would be surprised if he led on that he was picking with Ohio State and ended up going with Texas.",
      "But even though Corso will no longer be a part of Saturday mornings for college football fans, his impact will continue to be felt.",
      "His ability to bring entertainment to a preview show helped get away from seriousness. You can be outrageous and still do your job, but you can still have fun,\u201d Gaiero said. \u201cI think other shows have tried to do that, even political shows.\u201d",

      "But Director Emilie Gordenker says the original building, which is owned by the Dutch state, is in such poor condition it needs urgent and extensive repairs to keep its priceless collection and visitors safe.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t address the major maintenance that needs to happen, we will have to close,\" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The New York Times first reported on her concerns on Wednesday.",
      "She said the 50-year-old building needs \"major maintenance,\u201d and two years of talks with the government have not resolved a dispute about how to pay for repairs expected to start in 2028, last three years and cost 104 million euros ($121 million).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now getting very urgent,\u201d she said.",
      "She said that during the renovation, the museum would be partly closed and would therefore earn less from ticket sales. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re asking them to do is to help us finance the basic maintenance,\u201d she said.",
      "The nearby Rijksmuseum shut down for years for a largescale renovation, but Gordenker says that kind of major facelift is not what the Van Gogh Museum is appealing for.",

      "It said the museum objected to the subsidy decision last year and recently filed an appeal in a Dutch court that will be heard in February next year. \u201cIt is not unusual for parties to have a subsidy decision reviewed by the court,\u201d the ministry added.",
      "The dispute has its origins in a decision by Van Gogh\u2019s family to transfer a trove of his art \u2014 more than 200 paintings, 500 drawings and 900 letters along with works by contemporaries such as Paul Gauguin \u2014 to a foundation set up in 1962 to keep the collection together. In return, the government pledged to build and maintain a museum where the works could be displayed, the museum said in a statement.",
      "Gordenker argues that means the government should also help to fund the work the museum now needs.",

      "Darren Aronofsky has already made several indelibly New York movies, his latest, \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d is easily the director\u2019s most affectionate portrait of his hometown, writes AP Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "Darren Aronofsky has already made several indelibly New York movies. But loveable as was the subterranean monochrome paranoia of \u201cPi\u201d and charming as we all consider the pupil-dilating tragedy of his bleak Brighton Beach-set \u201cRequiem for a Dream,\" Aronofsky's latest, \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d is easily the director's most affectionate portrait of his hometown.",
      "That, too, may be a funny way to describe a movie where bodies get brutalized, corpses accumulate and even the cat comes away with a limp. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\u201d a terrific caper starring Austin Butler as a Lower East Side man inadvertently drawn into a nightmarish crime world, is a period movie. It's set in 1998. And no amount of blood can detract from the overwhelming endearment Aronofsky has for '90s New York.",
      "Butler plays Hank Thompson: a former baseball player who can't play anymore; a bartender who, after some of the early events of the movie, can\u2019t drink anymore; and a devoted San Francisco Giants fan surrounded by Mets fans. As his not-quite girlfriend Yvonne ( Zo\u00eb Kravitz ) says, he's \u201ca good country boy\u201d who calls his mom in California every day. They end every call with \u201cGo Giants!\u201d",
      "Hank is far from the first regular guy to be ensnared in underground crime syndicates, but there are a number of things that distinguish \u201cCaught Stealing.\u201d First, his troubles stem, like they do for so many New Yorkers, from his neighbor. Russ (Matt Smith), the mohawked Brit punk who lives next door, rushes out to fly to London, and he leaves Hank his cat to take care of.",
      "Soon, though, a pair of Russian gang skinheads (Yuri Kolokolnikov, Nikita Kukushkin) are banging on Russ' door and quickly after, pummeling Hank, too. Their beating of Hank is unexpectedly brutal, and the first sign that \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d is going for something a little different. When Hank wakes up in the hospital, he's down a kidney and told he can't drink alcohol ever again.",
      "For Hank, it's not his first blush with alcohol-connected fatality. In flashbacks that replay as Hank's nightmares, we see him as a hotshot high-school baseball player, soon to be drafted into the pros. While drinking and driving, he careens off the road to avoid a cow, driving straight into a pole. His buddy is dead, and Hank's knee won't ever be the same.",
      "Meanwhile, the Russian mob interest continues to spiral, drawing in a police detective (Regina King, always good), the skinheads' boss, Colorado (Bad Bunny), and a pair of Orthodox Jewish brothers (Liev Schreiber and Vincent D\u2019Onofrio). The question that keeps coming up is whether Hank can hack it in this world. Is he a killer? He doesn't think so, even though he has killed. As King's detective says, \u201cI thought maybe you played real ball.\u201d",

If it once appeared that Butler might be trapped in his breakthrough role, \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d shows how he can carry a movie in a much less adorned performance.",
      "For Aronofsky, little in his recent filmography ( \"The Whale,\" \u201cMother!\u201d) suggested that an \u201cAfter Hours\u201d-like New York odyssey was coming next from him. It's a little shaggy and you'll occasionally yearn for a bit more humor along the way. But \u201cCaught Stealing,\" based on Charlie Huston's 2004 novel, is a ride, foremost, in '90s nostalgia.",
      "The looming Twin Towers are a regular reminder that this was a long time ago, indeed, even if the New York of Aronofsky's movie seems achingly familiar to some of us. That goes for places the movie rushes past, like Kim's Video and Shea Stadium, the Alphabet City bars of the film and the now-bygone concerns of cell phone minutes running low. Hank has another neighbor, too, whom he and Yvonne mock for how he describes his job as \u201cbuilding websites.\u201d",
      "Late summer is always a funny time in movie theaters, but that goes especially for this year.

These are movies that might not be home runs, but their directors most definitely stretch them for extra bases.",

      "Guillermo del Toro rose to fame creating horror movies that will likely help shape the genre for generations to come",
      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Many fled when wildfires devastated Los Angeles earlier this year, but Guillermo del Toro rushed back in, determined to save his lifelong collection of horror memorabilia.",
      "It's the same loyalty that finds him making another tough decision to protect the items he loves like family: letting some of them go.",
      "Del Toro partnered with Heritage Auctions for a three-part auction to sell a fraction of a collection that is bursting at the seams. Online bidding for the first part on Sept. 26 started Thursday and includes over a hundred items, with more headed to the auction block next year.",
      "\u201cThis one hurts. The next one, I\u2019m going to be bleeding,\u201d del Toro, 60, said of the auction series. \u201cIf you love somebody, you have estate planning, you know, and this is me estate planning for a family that has been with me since I was a kid.\u201d",
      "Del Toro is one of the industry\u2019s most respected filmmakers, whose fascination with monsters and visual style will shape generations to come. But at his core, the Mexican-born horror buff is a collector. The Oscar-winner has long doubled as the sole caretaker of the \u201cBleak House\u201d \u2014 which stretches across two and a half Santa Monica homes nearly overflowing with thousands of ghoulish creatures, iconic comic drawings and paintings, books and movie props.",
      "The houses function not just as museums, but as libraries and workspaces where his imagination bounces off the oxblood-painted walls.",
      "\u201cI love what I have because I live with it. I actually am a little nuts, because I say hi to some of the life-size figures when I turn on the light,\u201d del Toro told The Associated Press, sitting in the dining room of one of the houses, now a sanctuary for \u201cHaunted Mansion\u201d memorabilia. \u201cThis is curated. This is not a casual collection.\u201d",
      "The auction includes behind-the-scene drawings and one-of-a-kind props from del Toro\u2019s own classics, as well as iconic works like Bernie Wrightson\u2019s illustrations for \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and Mike Mignola\u2019s pinup artwork for \u201cHellraiser.\u201d",
      "In January, del Toro had only a couple hours, his car and a few helping hands to save key pieces from the fires. Out of the over 5,000 items in his collection, he only managed to move about 120 objects. It wasn't the first time, as fires had come dangerously close to Bleak House twice before.",
      "The houses were spared, but fear consumed him. If a fire or earthquake swallowed them, he thought, \u201cWhat came out of it? You collected insurance? And what happened to that little segment of Richard Corben's life, or Jack Kirby\u2019s craft, or Bernie Wrightson\u2019s life?\u201d",
      "An auction, del Toro said, gives him peace of mind, as it ensures the items will land in the hands of another collector who will protect the items as he has. These are not just props or trinkets, he said, but \u201chistorical artifacts. They're pieces of audiovisual history for humanity.\u201d And his life's mission has been to protect as much of this history as he can.",
      "\u201cLook, this is in reaction to the fires. This is in reaction to loving this thing,\u201d del Toro told the AP.",
      "The initial auction uncovers who del Toro is as a collector, he said. Upcoming parts will expose how the filmmaker thinks, which he called a much more personal endeavor. The auction isn't just a \u201cpiece of business,\u201d for him, but rather a love letter to collectors everywhere, and encouragement to think beyond a movie and \u201clearn to read and write film design in a different way. That's my hope.\u201d",

      "\u201cAs collectors, you are basically keeping pieces of culture for generations to come.

Old folks solving cases \u2014 and outthinking police \u2014 is nothing new in our popular culture. Let\u2019s recall \u201cMurder, She Wrote,\u201d in which Angela Lansbury\u2019s Jessica Fletcher solved cases in tiny Cabot Cove, Maine \u2014 where close to 300 murders somehow occurred during the show\u2019s 12-year run.",

Pierce Brosnan\u2019s Ron is former trade unionist, and Ben Kingsley\u2019s Ibrahim a former psychiatrist. As we begin, the trio is considering a case from the \u201970s in which a woman fell out a window under mysterious circumstances.",

A young mother with a child nearby is shocked at the profanity. It\u2019s all too cute by half. We\u2019re supposed to believe razor-sharp Elizabeth doesn\u2019t know what \u201cWTF\u201d means?",
      "It\u2019s a few moments like this that cause some discomfort, raising the question of whether these characters are being, well, caricatured.

Someone takes her carry-on from an airplane overhead bin.",
      "Worse, Tess starts getting uncomfortable personal questions about her past at bookstore appearances and on social media \u2014 uncomfortable because she has long harbored a dark secret. It\u2019s one that she fears would destroy her new career and her family if it were ever revealed.",
      "In Tess, Ryan has created a likeable, compelling, complex character who struggles to come to terms with her past and finds the courage to confront the danger she faces.

      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry condemned Woody Allen for speaking at a Russian film festival, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine",
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced the Ukraine cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media reports quoted Allen as saying that he has always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Allen\u2019s participation in the festival, which \u201cbrings together supporters and mouthpieces of Putin.\u201d The ministry called it \u201ca disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\u201d adding that Allen \u201cis deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchange to continue.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut, whatever politicians have done, I don\u2019t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\u201d",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos. Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \u201cLove and Death\u201d spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release, \u201cCrimes and Misdemeanors,\u201d echoes Dostoevsky\u2019s \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \u201cA Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\u201d Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \u201cfinally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\u201d",

      "Hollywood's biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd Venice Film Festival",
      "VENICE, Italy -- Some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are heading to Venice, Italy, for the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival, which kicks off on Wednesday.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of everything you need to know about the festival, the Oscar buzz and who\u2019s going.",
      "It\u2019s one of the most prestigious film festivals in the world, second only to Cannes, and technically the oldest. Venice is also a reliably starry affair, gathering some of the best films in international cinema and often factoring into the Oscars race.",
      "The film festival was established in 1932, then a non-competitive event, by the La Biennale di Venezia, hosting films like \u201cGrand Hotel\u201d and \u201cIt Happened One Night.\u201d By 1935, they decided to make it an annual event. Suspicions that the festival was succumbing to fascist influences actually led to the establishment of the Cannes Film Festival, as an alternative, after the 1938 edition.",
      "The Golden Lion award as we know it today wouldn\u2019t be introduced until 1949 (\u201cRash\u00f4mon\u201d won in 1951). Other winners throughout history include \u201cBelle de jour\u201d (1967), \u201cAu revoir les enfants\u201d (1987), \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d (2005), \u201cSomewhere\u201d (2010), \u201cPoor Things\u201d (2023) and, last year, \u201cThe Room Next Door.\u201d",
      "The festival kicks off on Wednesday and runs through Sept. 6, when the awards will be announced. The opening night film is Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s \u201cLa Grazia.\u201d",
      "Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Emma Stone, Dwayne Johnson, Adam Sandler and Idris Elba are among the stars expected to grace the red carpets this year. It\u2019ll be the first time at the festival for both Roberts, starring in the #MeToo-themed drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d and Johnson, who transformed for his role as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Other stars in the lineup include Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Jesse Plemons, Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield, Ayo Edebiri, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Colman Domingo, Amanda Seyfried, Callum Turner and Jude Law.

      "Millions of Venezuelans are struggling to buy food as the economy unravels",
      "CORO, Venezuela -- Alnilys Chirino\u2019s tiny fridge and pantry are almost empty \u2014 a handful of peppers and wilting herbs, a kilo of rice, half that of beans, a bit of canned meat, some flour. Chirino used to worry about food spoiling quickly under western Venezuela's punishing heat. These days, her meager supplies rarely last long enough to go bad.",
      "Still, the 51-year-old must make those items stretch for days. Her three teenagers are counting on it. They sleep, study, work, pray, and play hungry. So do millions of Venezuelans across the country.",
      "The latest unraveling of Venezuela\u2019s economy, changes to foreign aid, sanctions from the United States, and cuts to state subsidies and programs have made many necessities simply unaffordable to the 80% of residents estimated to live in poverty. Housing, medicine, utilities \u2013 but no need is as dire as food.",
      "In the western state of Falcon, where state-owned oil refineries offered plenty of well-paying jobs before the country came undone in 2013, more than two dozen residents, including Chirino, described to The Associated Press how their woes center on food and how they dwell on the issue \u2014 how to buy it, how much and where \u2013 every day.",
      "Experts say that while a famine-level crisis is not imminent in Venezuela, the severe food insecurity is a disaster that will mark the population with lifelong physical and mental health challenges.",
      "President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 sworn in this year despite credible evidence he lost reelection \u2014 has created economic conditions that largely limited people's access to food nationwide, with the value of wages plummeting. Soup kitchens that fed thousands, mostly children, have been forced to close as he targets real and perceived opponents through a new law restricting the work of nongovernmental organizations.",
      "The government's press office didn't respond to a message seeking comment on food insecurity amid the economic crisis.",
      "Parents, educators, doctors, humanitarian workers and religious leaders say food is simply out of reach to many, with children suffering the most. They go to bed early to avoid hunger pangs, skip school and snatch food from each other at aid sites.",
      "Chirino's family is among those who increasingly fear the return of the malnutrition and starvation that gripped the country from 2016 to 2018. She worries constantly for her teenagers: Juan, Jos\u00e9 and Angerlis Colina.",
      "\u201cThey ask me, \u2018What are we going to do tomorrow?'\" Chirino said. \"'What are we going to eat?\u2019\u201d",
      "For the Chirinos and millions of Venezuelans, each mealtime of each day is a struggle.",
      "Juan Colina takes three rolls of bread \u2014 the only food he'll have for breakfast on this summer day \u2014 and dunks them in a sugary, orange-flavored drink. It was something of a treat. Money has lost so much value in the last few months that the family typically drinks only tap water and rarely eats protein.",
      "They've grown used to it. Juan felt fortunate to wake without a headache. Jos\u00e9 wasn't so lucky and stayed in bed.",
      "They often skip school when feeling this way. The law guarantees all students a daily free lunch, but that hasn't happened for ages, families and teachers across Venezuela told AP.",
      "As the meals stopped and the quality of education fell, students began regularly missing school over the last decade, a trend documented by local and international nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Health care experts say animal protein is the first thing families reduce or eliminate from their diet when prices increase, and they tend to substitute cheaper, less nutritious foods. But poor nutrition can lead to stunting, headaches, fatigue and other health issues in children.",
      "Chirino knows that all too well.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s their diet,\u201d she said of her kids' headaches.",
      "But the last time she could afford to purchase meat \u2014 enough ground beef for perhaps two servings \u2014 was May.",
      "At lunchtime, Jos\u00e9 stayed in his room, his head pounding. Angerlis joined her mother and Juan at the table for lunch before heading to school.",
      "Chirino cooked a pot of rice and another of black beans, both of which her mother had gifted her the day before, when the pantry was essentially bare. Chirino, Angerlis and Juan ate a bowl each. Juan chuckled when Angerlis took bites so fast she burned her tongue.",
      "Days earlier, Angerlis said, a classmate who hadn't eaten fainted at school. But even knowing there would be no food on campus, she grabbed her bag and headed off.",
      "Teachers and administrators across the country are renewing pleas for parents to keep children home if they've not had at least one meal and if they have no food to bring to eat during breaks. But not all abide by the request, and students cannot always hide their hunger from classmates and others.",

But teachers, cooks and administrators say what they receive is inconsistent and insufficient.",
      "And with little to eat at home, on the occasions when the scent of food wafts through school buildings, more students are asking for seconds.",
      "\u201cThere are some who, my goodness, they repeat two or three times. There are kids who eat a lot,\u201d Deyanira Santos, a cook at a 170-student school that hadn't received supplies in three weeks. \u201cThey have needs at home. ... \u2018I have already eaten. Can you give me one to go?\u2019 We put it in a container.\u201d",
      "At home, Chirino sorted through the clothing, accessories and linens she sells to neighbors and acquaintances. Her only income sources are the $70 a month she earns from her sales and a monthly government stipend of about $4. She spends it all on food.",
      "The weakening of the bolivar is the driver of Venezuela's currency crisis. When a currency quickly loses significant value, people\u2019s money buys less because prices \u2014 particularly of imported goods, like roughly half of Venezuela\u2019s food \u2013 constantly rise to match the exchange rate. It also has meant high inflation and stagnant wages.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s monthly minimum wage of 130 bolivars, or $0.90, has not increased since 2022, putting it well below the United Nations\u2019 measure of extreme poverty of $2.15 a day. Even with government stipends, many public sector workers survive on roughly $160 per month, while the average private sector employee earns about $237, according to the independent Venezuelan Observatory of Finances.",
      "The price of a basic basket of food has topped $500, according to the Observatory, an organization of economists \u2014 some of whom were detained this summer after high inflation data was published, as the government cracks down on dissent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more difficult every day for people to access food of a certain quality,\u201d said the Rev. Gilberto Garc\u00eda, whose Catholic church runs a soup kitchen. \u201cPeople eat, but they usually eat carbohydrates. And that\u2019s how people survive.\u201d",
      "Chirino warmed canned meat and served it with rice for dinner. Her adult daughter and toddler grandson joined them \u2014 more mouths to feed, but they were grateful to have even a small meal on the table.",
      "About a block away, people lined up outside the neighborhood convenience store.",
      "Chirino is among the many Venezuelans who say they're buying food almost exclusively at corner stores, where they can run up an account and walk over one, two, even three times a day. City residents also buy from public markets, but grocery store trips are rare.",
      "\u201cWe give credit to the neighbors who do pay back when they receive their paycheck or stipend,\u201d Diego Reverol, whose family owns a corner store, said, referring to a stipend state employees receive on the 15th of the month.",
      "Other government stipends are available to those who sign up for the ruling party-run subsidy program, but they're significantly smaller than those of state employees. The program also offers families the option to purchase a combination of food \u2013 the same as what's distributed to schools \u2013 monthly. However, most of the two dozen people in Falcon who spoke to AP said they'd not received the food since the spring.",
      "Yamelis Ruiz said her family's challenges are compounded by the loss of critical help from the World Food Program, which distributed food, refurbished school cafeterias and served meals after reaching an agreement with Maduro\u2019s government in 2021 to support the most vulnerable. WFP prioritized Falcon, with its massive sand dunes and mountain ranges that reach the Caribbean Sea, due to the population's particular problems with food insecurity.",
      "But citing funding challenges, the WFP this year has deeply cut its aid in Venezuela \u2014 Falcon included \u2014 and beyond. Ruiz said she had already stopped receiving monthly shelf-stable food rations from WFP when the organization further reduced the number of days it would feed kids and families at schools, to eight from 20.",
      "\u201cFood or medicines. Either I buy one thing or the other,\u201d said Ruiz, whose daughter has a congenital brain condition that requires costly treatment.",
      "Even as local and international nonprofits have been forced to shut down assistance efforts in Venezuela, Chirino's church still offers a weekly lunch at its soup kitchen.",
      "Chirino, a devout Catholic, feels blessed. She often attends Mass with her family before the meal, but on this day Juan felt too fatigued to make the service.",
      "The extent of hunger across the country is somewhat unknown. Dr. Huniades Urbina, a pediatrician and former director of Venezuela\u2019s largest public children\u2019s hospital, said that's in part because government-run hospitals have banned personnel from including malnutrition in patients\u2019 medical histories.",
      "Chirino sees that hunger every week in the faces of those lining up for food. Juan managed to get out of bed and to church just in time for this meal: an arepa stuffed with ground beef and plantains.",
      "More than 70 children sat, their chatty voices dwindling as they ate. Finishing in record time, dozens swarmed the counter where the volunteer cooks were ready to hand out leftovers. Some pushed; others raised their arms or stood on their tiptoes.",
      "\u201cMe, me, me,\u201d some yelled, angling for a second arepa.",
      "One boy hadn't bitten his yet when he noticed an empty-handed friend. Without hesitation, he split it in half. The boys shared, each done eating in less than a minute, and left.",
      "Chirino had refused to take an arepa. She didn't want to keep one from a hungry kid. But when most of the children were gone, a cook handed her one. She began eating alone, and soon Jos\u00e9 joined her. He reached for her plate, grabbing half the arepa and taking a few bites.",
      "Her son, too, was still hungry.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the upcoming fall and winter season",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators approved updated COVID-19 shots Wednesday but limited their use for many Americans \u2014 and removed one of the two vaccines available for young children.",
      "The new shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed their use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity. That presents new barriers to access for millions of Americans who\u2019d have to prove their risk -- and millions more who may want to get vaccinated and suddenly no longer qualify.",
      "Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine will no longer be available for any child underage 5, after the FDA said it was revoking the shot\u2019s emergency authorization for that age group.",
      "Parents will still be able to seek out shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company\u2019s Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.",
      "The revamped vaccines target a newer version of the continuously evolving virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they\u2019ll be able to get one, with access dependent on various decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.",
      "The new restrictions \u2014 previewed by FDA officials in May \u2014 are a break from the previous U.S. policy, which recommended an annual COVID-19 shot for all Americans 6 months and up.",
      "The approach reflects heightened skepticism about the ongoing risks of COVID-19 and the need for yearly booster shots from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who were both outspoken critics of wide-scale vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThe American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,\u201d Kennedy wrote on social media.",
      "Kenned said Novavax's shot is only open to people 12 or older, not younger children \u2013 and under the same risk-based restrictions as are now in place for the Moderna and Pfizer options. It's the nation's only protein-based COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "Some medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have objected to the new limits, saying they may block vaccine access for families who want to protect their children. Last week, the group offered its own recommendations for kids, saying annual COVID shots are strongly recommended for children ages 6 months to 2 years and advised for older children.",
      "That differs from the latest guidance under Kennedy, which doesn\u2019t recommend the shots for healthy children of any age, but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.",
      "Many countries have scaled back COVID-19 vaccinations in recent years, and some U.S. experts say the change makes sense here, given that nearly all Americans have some protection from previous vaccination or infection.",
      "But implementing the shift presents a number of logistical problems.",
      "Insurers typically base their vaccine coverage decisions on the recommendations of a panel of advisers to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some say they will also look to medical professional groups, including the American Medical Association.",
      "Earlier this year, Kennedy dissolved the CDC panel and replaced its members with a number of doctors and researchers who have repeatedly questioned the safety of commonly used vaccines and ingredients. The panel is expected to meet in September, but no specific date has been set and no agenda released.",
      "Depending on the panel\u2019s advice, Americans underage 65 could be expected to provide documentation of a serious medical condition before they can get a shot. Complicating the rollout is the fact that pharmacists \u2014 who administer most COVID vaccines in the U.S. \u2014 typically aren\u2019t expected to collect that kind of information. And laws governing their ability to administer routine vaccinations vary by state, where pharmacists are licensed.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors say Luigi Mangione, accused of killing the CEO of UnitedHealthcare on a Manhattan sidewalk, has inspired others to embrace violence over reasoned debate.",
      "As evidence of Mangione's growing influence, prosecutors cited the last month's deadly mass shooting at the National Football League headquarters.",
      "The prosecution outlined the threat in a filing late Wednesday on a procedural matter in federal court in Manhattan, where they plan to try to convince a jury that Mangione deserves death. No federal trial date has been set.",
      "Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges, was arrested five days after the Dec. 4 killing of CEO Brian Thompson. He is being held without bail in a federal jail in Brooklyn.",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in April that she was directing federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for \u201can act of political violence\u201d and a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "In their filing Wednesday, prosecutors wrote that Mangione poses a continuing danger in part because he seeks to influence others.",
      "\u201cSimply put, the defendant hoped to normalize the use of violence to achieve ideological or political objectives,\u201d they said. \u201cSince the murder, certain quarters of the public \u2014 who openly identify as acolytes of the defendant \u2014 have increasingly begun to view violence as an acceptable, or even necessary, substitute for reasoned political disagreement.\u201d",
      "In a footnote, prosecutors referenced the gunman who went into an office building not far from where Thompson was shot in midtown Manhattan, then killed four people including an off-duty police officer, a financial services firm executive and a security guard, and wounded others, including an NFL employee.",

      "Some colleges are allowing pets in dorms to help students feel more at home",
      "Crossing paths with dogs, cats and other animals is part of campus life for students at Eckerd College, a liberal arts school in Florida that allows pets to live in dormitories.",
      "Sophie Nocera, an Eckerd senior, said she probably knows the names of pets better than her fellow students.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the case for a lot of the students,\" said Nocera, who lives on the campus in St. Petersburg with her Border collie, Zuko. \"When I'm walking my dog, I often hear, \u2018Oh my god, hi, Zuko!\u2019 It's like I\u2019m not even there.\"",
      "Some colleges and universities around the country welcome pets in campus residences, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Stephens College in Missouri.",
      "For students, the companionship can help reduce stress, anxiety and homesickness. The colleges also see benefits for student engagement and helping them build connections with one another.",
      "Federal law requires public and private colleges to allow service animals and emotional support animals in student housing. But growing numbers of schools are allowing pets, with various restrictions.",
      "MIT allows only cats, in limited numbers and in preapproved spaces. At Eckerd, students can bring their family pets to live with them on campus after their first semester. The college requires pets to have been part of students\u2019 home life at least six months before coming to campus and must not be venomous or aggressive.",
      "At the University of Northern Colorado, students in three of the more than dozen residence halls on campus are allowed to have dogs and cats. The animals must be at least 6 months old and no more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms). Students are limited to one pet. This fall, the school will have the most registered pets on campus since it began allowing them over a decade ago, said Jediah Cummins, executive director of housing.",
      "\u201cOne of the markers of adulthood is, \u2018Can I not just take care of myself, but can I take care of another living being?\u2019 That\u2019s an important part of this,\u201d Cummins said.",
      "Molly Cheer, a senior nursing major, said she chose Northern Colorado in part because of its pet-friendly policy. When she is stressed about school, she said, it helps coming home to Louie, the cat she adopted during her first year.",
      "\u201cWhenever I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I pick him up and cuddle him, and he just deals with it for as long as I need it,\u201d she said.",

Jack Layden, assistant dean for residential life and student engagement, said the college has hosted hundreds of animals, including rabbits, ferrets, chinchillas, birds, guinea pigs, bearded dragons, geckos, turtles, snakes, frogs, fish, and even a tarantula.",
      "Nocera said Zuko has helped her meet other people on campus, as well as emotionally, when she struggled with a decision to change her major.",
      "\u201cI remember coming back to my dorm and just melting to the floor, and Zuko was right there. And I remember thinking, whatever happens tomorrow, I\u2019m going to wake up, and I\u2019m going to take him to the dog park. And, we\u2019re going to go play fetch regardless of what my major is,\" said Nocera, who is the staff director of Pet Life, a student-led department on campus tasked with administering the pet policy.",
      "At Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, Eva Chatterjee-Sutton saw the difference a pet can make when a first-year student was struggling to make connections before her mother suggested a puppy. After the dog's arrival, the student became more involved in campus life, said Chatterjee-Sutton, vice president of student life.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely changed her college trajectory and her connection with others on campus,\u201d Chatterjee-Sutton said.",
      "Pet-friendly dorms require colleges to consider things like safety concerns, noise complaints, how to avoid agitating animals during fire alarm tests, as well as additional costs for cleaning, Layden said. Some schools charge a pet fee, which varies by school, type of pet and is often included in housing expenses. For example, at Stephens College, the annual fee for a dog or cat is $220, for a cage- or aquarium-dwelling pet is $50 and free for fish. Others require students to have liability insurance and roommate agreements. Pets are required to be restrained when in public, and most colleges require students to ensure their pets are healthy and vaccinated.",
      "Eckerd and other colleges recognize pets' role in their students' lives at graduation ceremonies, allowing them to cross the commencement stage together in some cases.",
      "\u201cHaving pets obviously isn\u2019t for everyone, and that is totally OK,\u201d Nocera said. \u201cBut for the people that it is a good fit for, it is so worth it. This upcoming year, I'll be graduating, and Zuko will be in his little pet graduation ceremony, walking across the stage with me.\u201d",

      "A separate team led by Special Prosecutor Cho Eun-suk said former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo was charged with abetting Yoon\u2019s imposition of martial law, which investigators say amounted to a rebellion, as well as falsifying and destroying official documents, and lying under oath.",
      "Dozens of people have been arrested or investigated over Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle, corruption allegations involving his wife, and other controversies from his three years in office, including an alleged cover-up of a marine\u2019s drowning death during a 2023 flood rescue operation.",
      "Key suspects include former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of planning martial law with Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly in an unsuccessful attempt to block lawmakers from voting to lift it. More than 60 people were separately indicted for rioting at a Seoul court which issued the warrant for Yoon\u2019s first arrest in January.",
      "Assistant special counsel Park Ji-young told a televised briefing that Han was the highest official who could have blocked Yoon\u2019s attempt to impose martial law. Park said Han still played an \u201cactive\u201d role in Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration by trying to get Yoon\u2019s decree passed through a Cabinet Council meeting as a way to give \u201cprocedural legitimacy\u201d to it.",
      "Han has maintained he conveyed to Yoon that he opposed his martial law plan.",
      "Cho\u2019s team earlier requested the Seoul Central District Court to issue a warrant to arrest Han. But the court on Wednesday dismissed that request, saying it determined that there were little chances that Han would flee or destroy evidence.",

      "MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Israel Peter was 6 years old when Boko Haram Islamic extremists attacked his village in northeastern Nigeria and his family fled. Eight years later, he still hasn\u2019t returned to school.",
      "A rare opportunity to change that disappeared this year, when a nonprofit offering free education to Boko Haram victims rejected Peter\u2019s application. It cited the abrupt loss of U.S. funding as the Trump administration dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Multiple backers of the school had received USAID funding.",
      "\u201cNow my future will not be great,\u201d said Peter, who dreams of being an engineer. His trembling voice was barely above a whisper. He spends his days helping out at his father\u2019s small farm. They cannot afford to pay school fees.",
      "The school run by the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation has benefited 3,000 children in Borno state, the epicenter of the 16-year conflict with Boko Haram that has displaced and orphaned many.",
      "Boko Haram, which wants to establish Islamic law in the region, forbids Western education and rose to global prominence after its mass abductions of students.",
      "The Associated Press visited the region to document how funding cuts by the U.S., Nigeria\u2019s once biggest donor, have affected civilians in one of the world\u2019s longest-running conflicts. More than 35,000 people have been killed and 2.6 million others displaced in parts of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.",
      "With U.S. funding gone, the school has let go of 700 of its 2,200 students as well as 20 teachers, officials said, with no new enrollment and further cuts likely.",
      "Millions of people in the region have relied heavily on aid groups and foreign partners to survive. USAID had funded a range of projects, from healthcare to education and social welfare, disbursing $1.5 billion to Nigeria between 2023 and 2024. Now, only a few projects like PEPFAR survive.",
      "Other funders like Britain have been pulling back, too, citing pressing financial needs at home.",
      "\u201cUSAID\u2019s reach was vast, benefiting millions of Nigerian children. Its sudden withdrawal has created a critical void that must be urgently addressed,\u201d said Crystal Ikanih-Musa, a former Africa regional advocacy manager for the Malala Fund, which focuses on education.",
      "The Borno state commissioner, Lawan Clark, asserted to the AP that the impact of the U.S. funding retreat is not significant on education, as donors primarily focus on helping students learn within existing structures.",
      "But many families like Peter\u2019s can\u2019t afford them.",
      "Despite having the highest number of out-of-school children in the world \u2014 over 10 million, according to UNICEF \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s government funds education at between 4% and 7% of its federal budget. That\u2019s short of the 15% to 20% global benchmark recommended by UNESCO.",
      "The impact of the under-funding is far worse in the northeast, where conflict has ruined key infrastructure and families are preoccupied with survival.",
      "The Future Prowess Islamic Foundation school was founded in Borno state in 2007, two years before the fighting began, initially providing education to orphans. But its mission expanded to support children affected by the conflict.",
      "Now school officials and aid groups worry that children they can no longer support might end up being welcomed by the extremists.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's envoys have been causing diplomatic tensions with allied countries",
      "LONDON -- Do not antagonize one's opponents unnecessarily, a basic principle of diplomacy says. But as the United States faces a trade war with China and various tensions overseas, President Donald Trump's emissaries are increasingly ticking off allied countries and being called to account.",
      "Just this week, no fewer than three U.S. envoys scrambled to extricate themselves from diplomatic hot water.",
      "Denmark\u2019s foreign minister summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country to answer for reports that at least three people with connections to Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in Greenland, a Danish territory. France summoned the U.S. ambassador, Trump in-law Charles Kushner, over his letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging the country has not done enough to fight antisemitism. And the American ambassador to Turkey, longtime Trump friend Tom Barrack, apologized Thursday for using the word \u201canimalistic\u201d while calling for a gaggle of reporters to quiet down during a press conference in Lebanon.",
      "But in the other two cases, the Trump administration stood pat. Kushner did not show up for his summonsing, leaving the French to take it up with his No. 2. The top diplomat in Denmark did attend his meeting in Copenhagen, and the State Department said a \u201cproductive conversation\u201d ensued. But behind the scenes in Washington, the Trump administration \u2014 through an official who spoke only on condition of anonymity \u2014 had a far more casual response.",
      "\u201cThe Danes,\" the official said, \u201cneed to calm down.\u201d",
      "There was much tsk-tsking from the diplomatic world over the indelicate exchanges, which would perhaps have been minor on their own.",
      "But they're consistent with Trump's blunt-spoken style, his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to foreign policy and his attitude toward reporters \u2014 all of which appeal to broad swaths of his political base. And they track with the president's record of upending norms. Indeed, the State Department has offered little in response, except to say that it supports Kushner's letter to Macron and that the government \u201cdoes not control or direct\u201d the actions of private citizens in Greenland.",
      "White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly dismissed the notion that the recent diplomatic kerfuffles have undercut Trump\u2019s global standing or dimmed his trust in his envoys.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has restored America\u2019s standing on the world stage, and his foreign policy accomplishments speak for themselves,\" Kelly said, citing Trump's trade deals, his strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities and the freeing of Americans detained in other countries as examples. \u201cHe has full confidence in his entire team to advance his America First foreign policy agenda.\u201d",
      "The trifecta of ire against American diplomats in recent days was only the latest against Trump's overseas appointees, several of whom raised eyebrows during the president's first term. That's in part due to the particularly American practice \u2014 in both parties \u2014 of handing coveted postings to campaign donors and presidential friends regardless of their diplomatic experience.",
      "Trump's diplomats have something of a track record of annoying foreign governments. During his first term, numerous U.S. ambassadors from Iceland to Germany and South Africa as well as the European Union got under the skin of their host governments, prompting summonses if not private complaints.",
      "One former senior State Department official said Trump loved the publicity these incidents received and often sent the ambassadors in question congratulatory notes when their actions produced news coverage.",
      "The main exception to that was Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the EU whom Trump fired just days after Sondland testified on Capitol Hill during Trump\u2019s first impeachment proceedings over Ukraine.",
      "The hearings touched on another messy diplomatic matter \u2014 Trump's ousting of his ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who testified that she felt pressured to issue statements of support for Trump. \u201cThe woman,\u201d Trump said during a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d",
      "Still, the recent dustups were striking for their risk of amplifying tensions among Western allies as the U.S. and China vie for economic superiority and talk of a meetup between their leaders as soon as this fall.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration stresses, I think rightly, that the U.S.-China rivalry is now the major axis around which international affairs turn,\u201d Iver B. Neumann, director of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, an independent think tank in Norway, wrote in an email. \u201cOne of the major assets of the U.S. in that rivalry is that it has a high number of allies, whereas China only has one (North Korea).

      "(Trump has said several times and in several contexts, \u201cI don't trust anybody,\u201d including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.)",
      "The ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador on Monday, a formal and public notice of displeasure. He did not show, so French officials met with the embassy\u2019s No. 2 instead. Kushner, a real-estate developer, is the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump has been relatively quiet recently about his desire to acquire Greenland, the Danish territory in the Arctic, for security purposes. In March, Greenland voted to decide its own future as it moves toward independence from Denmark.",
      "But Trump's hint that he could invade the massive island stands. So when Denmark's main broadcaster reported Wednesday that at least three people with connections to Trump had been carrying out covert influence operations in Greenland, Denmark's Foreign Ministry summoned the top U.S. diplomat in the country, Mark Stroh, a career member of the foreign service, for an explanation.",
      "The State Department said \"the U.S. government does not control or direct the actions of private citizens,\" values its relationship with Denmark and \"respects the right of Greenlanders to determine their own future.\u201d",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV praised the virtue of listening before speaking as he received an award Thursday from his Augustinian religious order in the United States on the feast day of St. Augustine.",
      "Leo reflected on peace, service and St. Augustine during a video message to his fellow American Augustinians gathered in Philadelphia, near Leo\u2019s alma mater, Villanova University.",
      "The former Robert Prevost, who was twice elected the superior of the religious order, thanked his brothers for the award and reaffirmed that \u201cSo much of who I am I owe to the spirit and the teachings of Saint Augustine.\u201d",
      "Leo has said from the start of his pontificate that he is a \u201cson of St. Augustine\u201d and he has infused his speeches, homilies and messages with the saint\u2019s teachings and values.",
      "The fifth century St. Augustine of Hippo inspired the 13th century religious Augustinian order as a community of \u201cmendicant\u201d friars, whose spirituality is rooted in a deep interior life of prayer, living in community, and journeying together in search of truth in God.",
      "Leo recalled the Augustinian motto in Latin: \u201cveritas, unitas, caritas\u201d (truth, unity, love) in explaining how he lives his faith and vocation.",
      "\u201cPeace begins with what we say and do and how we say and do it. Saint Augustine reminds us that before we speak, we first must listen,\u201d he said.",

      "Fire departments are increasingly switching to gear that doesn\u2019t contain potentially cancer-causing chemicals",
      "EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Every time he rushed out on a fire call, East Providence Lt. Thomas Votta knew he put himself at risk for cancer. There are potential carcinogens in the smoke billowing out of a house fire, but also risks from wearing his chemically-treated gear.",
      "Last month, the Rhode Island fire department became the nation's first to give the 11-year veteran and all his 124 fellow firefighters new gear free of PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.",
      "Known as forever chemicals because of how long they remain in the environment, PFAS have been linked to a host of health problems, including increased risk of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease and babies born with low birth weights.",
      "\u201cWe are exposed to so many chemicals when we go to fires,\u201d Votta said. \u201cHaving it inside our gear, touching or very close to our skin was very, very concerning. Knowing that\u2019s gone now, it gives us a little bit of relief. We\u2019re not getting it from every angle.\u201d",
      "The PFAS in the multilayered coats and pants \u2014 primarily meant to repel water and contaminants like oil and prevent moisture-related burns \u2014 have been a growing concern among firefighters for several years.",
      "Cancer has replaced heart disease as the biggest cause of line-of-duty deaths, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, the union that represents firefighters and EMS workers. Firefighters are at higher risk than the general population of getting skin, kidney and other types of cancer, according to a study led by the American Cancer Society.",
      "Firefighters are exposed to smoke from faster and hotter blazes in buildings and wildfires, many containing toxic chemicals like arsenic and asbestos. In addition to the PFAS in their gear, the IAFF is also concerned about firefighting foam that contains the chemical and is being phased out in many places.",
      "\u201cThe question that is obvious to us is that why would we have carcinogens intentionally infused into our personal protective equipment?\u201d IAFF General President Edward Kelly, who was elected in 2021 in part on a campaign to address PFAS dangers, said at a news conference this month.",
      "It can be difficult to determine the cause of a firefighter's cancer since the disease can take years to develop and genetics, diet and other lifestyle factors can play a role, experts say. Where a firefighter works \u2014 cities, suburbs or rural areas \u2014 also can impact the level of exposure to toxins.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s good they\u2019re shining a light on the health of their workers,\u201d said Dr. Lecia Sequist, program director at the Cancer Early Detection and Diagnostics Clinic at Mass General Hospital.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the data is mature enough that we have a clear understanding of what the unique causes of cancer in firefighters might be that\u2019s different from the general population.\u201d",
      "Still, health concerns among firefighters have sparked a flurry of lawsuits against makers of gear and PFAS chemicals. Seven states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have passed laws banning PFAS in gear and two others introduced bills calling for bans, according to the IAFF.",
      "The union has also targeted the agency that sets voluntary standards for firefighting gear and other safety requirements. In a 2023 lawsuit, the union accused the National Fire Protection Association, or NFPA, of setting standards that can only be met with PFAS-treated material and working with several gear makers to maintain that requirement \u2014 something the association denied.",
      "Last year, the agency announced new standards restricting use of 24 classes of chemicals including PFAS in gear \u2014 though it is considering delaying the law until March to give companies more time to comply.",
      "\u201cThe development of this new standard marks the most significant and complex shift in how firefighter protective gear is made in a generation,\" said NFPA spokesperson Tom Lyons.",
      "Amid the state bans and legal fights, some of the largest gear makers are shifting away from PFAS. Smaller companies have also emerged marketing what they claim is PFAS-free gear. Hydrocarbon wax or silicone-based finish often replaces PFAS in the outer shell and removes it from the middle, moisture barrier.",

      "But switching to PFAS alternatives hasn't been easy.",
      "Since companies often don't list chemicals in gear, fire departments are often in the dark as to whether it's actually safer while also complying with heat stress, moisture and durability requirements. And PFAS-treated gear is still on the market, supported by the American Chemical Council, which argues these materials are the \u201conly viable options\u201d to \u201cmeet vital performance properties.\u201d",
      "San Francisco was considering getting PFAS-free gear from one company until tests showed the chemical was present. The company addressed the problem and the fire department bought its first 50 of 700 sets this month.",
      "\u201cThe biggest challenge has been trust \u2014 or more accurately, the lack of it,\u201d said Matthew Alba, a San Francisco department battalion chief who is being treated for a brain tumor he blames on fighting wildfires.",
      "In Quincy, Massachusetts, the department bought what it thought were 30 sets of PFAS-free gear, but independent tests revealed the chemical's presence.",
      "\u201cThese last few months dealing with this issue has been frustrating, angry and truthfully sad seeing what these companies continue to pull,\u201d Tom Bowes, president of the IAFF local, told a news conference attended by dozens of Quincy firefighters this month.",
      "Researchers at Duke and North Carolina State universities argue concerns over the new gear suggest the transition away from PFAS has been rushed \u2014 potentially exposing firefighters to new chemicals and giving them gear that hasn't been proven safe.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve talked to fire chiefs, fire departments across the country, across the world, they\u2019re all dealing with it,\u201d said Bryan Ormond, a professor at North Carolina State and director of its Milliken Textile Protection and Comfort Center. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to figure out ... how to move forward safely and protect our people because we don\u2019t necessarily know what the new gear is going to do.\"",
      "But Graham Peaslee, an emeritus professor at the University of Notre Dame who tested gear for San Francisco and Quincy and is working with five other departments, said concerns about PFAS-free gear were a \u201cscare tactic\u201d from the chemical companies that want to keep selling their products.",
      "In East Providence, testing showed the fire department's first attempt to buy PFAS-free gear contained flame retardants that pose increased cancer risk and didn't adequately protect from heat. A new supplier provided PFAS-free materials that offered the heat protection.",
      "\u201cIt's a home run,\u201d Fire Chief Michael Carey said of the gear, which cost $658,000 and was paid for by pandemic funds.",

In addition to hampering the states' climate goals, losing out on all that renewable power could drive up electricity prices throughout the region, Democratic officials say.",
      "Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects. Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.",

      "OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine -- The case of a Maine police officer arrested by immigration authorities even though he was vetted by a government system called \u201cE-Verify\u201d has raised questions about what employers can do to make sure they\u2019re employing people who can legally work.",
      "E-Verify is an online system that compares information entered by an employer from an employee\u2019s documents with records available to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration. It's used to determine the employment eligibility of citizens and noncitizens.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin accused Old Orchard Beach, Maine, of \u201creckless reliance\u201d on the E-Verify program when it hired Jamaica national Jon Luke Evans, who was later detained and agreed to leave the country earlier this month.",
      "But it\u2019s the government\u2019s own program. And experts say there\u2019s not a whole lot more employers can do in terms of vetting.",
      "\u201cI think employers are between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at the University of North Florida. \u201cEven an employer who is trying to comply with the law can have difficulty doing it.\u201d",
      "Before 1986, it was essentially legal for employers to hire people regardless of their immigration status. Then came the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which involved a large-scale immigrant legalization program that was paired with a requirement that employers no longer hire people who weren\u2019t legally authorized to work in the U.S.",
      "Employers then had to fill out a form called an I-9, which required workers to present documents showing that they were authorized to work. But it was difficult to verify if the documents were valid. As part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the E-Verify system was established to help verify those documents.",
      "Unlike I-9 forms, which are federally required for every employer, E-Verify is mandated on a state-by-state basis, otherwise it is voluntary. According to an Equifax tally, about 23 states require E-Verify for at least some public and/or private employers.",
      "Zavodny said the system is generally accurate in terms of matching documents, but there are flaws. For example, if an employee's right to work is revoked after it has already been verified \u2014 perhaps if their visa expires \u2014 it doesn\u2019t automatically notify the employer.",
      "A lack of biometrics also hinders the process. If there\u2019s a photo in the E-Verify system, manual photo matching by the employer helps. But a lot of times, there\u2019s no photo in the system.",
      "And the system is not without critics. A 2021 review of E-Verify by the Office of the Inspector General concluded that until U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services addresses the system's shortcomings, \u201cit cannot ensure the system provides accurate employment eligibility results.\u201d",
      "The federal government's disagreement with Old Orchard Beach over E-Verify's reliability came despite pushes by President Donald Trump and his allies to bring the system into wider use. Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump's second term, calls for it to be mandatory.",
      "Use of the system is not widespread. Barely a fifth of U.S. employers use it, though some huge businesses do, including Walmart, Starbucks and Home Depot.",
      "Language calling for mandatory nationwide E-Verify was dropped from budget proposals during the first Trump administration. The system has also faced criticism from some employers.",
      "An Omaha, Nebraska, food packaging company owner said a raid of his business by immigration officials this year came despite his use of E-Verify for employees. Glenn Valley Foods owner Gary Rohwer said in June that the business \u201cdid everything we could possibly do\u201d to hire eligible workers.",
      "Rohwer didn't respond to requests for comment this month. Old Orchard Beach officials declined to comment on the town's recent troubles. DHS officials also didn't respond.",

      "SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Brazil\u2019s labor court on Friday ordered Volkswagen to pay 165 million reais (about $30 million) for collective moral damages after workers were subjected to slave-like conditions at a company-owned farm in the Amazon during the 1970s and 1980s. Prosecutors said it is the largest such reparation in the country\u2019s history.",
      "The Labor Prosecutor\u2019s Office launched an investigation in 2019 after obtaining extensive documentation from a local priest who had tracked the case for decades. Following further inquiries and witness testimony, prosecutors formally charged Volkswagen in 2024.",
      "The court accepted the charges that hundreds of workers were subjected to degrading conditions between 1974 and 1986 at a farm in Para state, owned by Volkswagen through a subsidiary. The farm was used for cattle ranching and logging.",
      "According to court filings, about 300 workers were hired under irregular contracts to clear the forest and prepare pastures. They were monitored by armed guards, lived in precarious housing, received insufficient food and were forced to stay on the farm under a system of debt bondage. No medical care was provided, even to those who contracted malaria.",

      "Oregon lawmakers are considering a proposal that would make the state the second in the nation to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program",
      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.",
      "Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.",
      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.",
      "Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.",
      "As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.",

      "Under Hawaii's program, which began phasing in last month, EV drivers can pay $8 per 1,000 miles driven, capped at $50, or an annual fee of $50.",
      "In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.",
      "In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.",
      "Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.",
      "Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.",
      "Many people don't realize that \"both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,\u201d said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.",
      "Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,\u201d Morgan said.",

      "A feud over management of one of North America's longest rivers has been simmering in the courts for years",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A simmering feud over management of one of North America\u2019s longest rivers reached a boiling point when the U.S. Supreme Court sent western states and the federal government back to the negotiating table last year.",
      "Now the battle over waters of the Rio Grande could be nearing resolution as New Mexico, Texas and Colorado announced fresh settlement proposals Friday designed to rein in groundwater pumping along the river in New Mexico and ensure enough river water reliably makes it to Texas.",
      "New Mexico officials say the agreements allow water conservation decisions to be made locally while avoiding a doomsday scenario of billion-dollar payouts on water shortfalls.",
      "Farmers in southern New Mexico increasingly have turned to groundwater as hotter and drier conditions reduced river flows and storage. That pumping is what prompted Texas to sue, claiming the practice was cutting into water deliveries.",
      "It will be up to the special master overseeing the case to make a recommendation to the Supreme Court.",
      "If endorsed by the court, the combined settlements promise to restore order to an elaborate system of storing and sharing water between two vast, adjacent irrigation districts in southern New Mexico and western Texas.",
      "Still, tough decisions await New Mexico under its new obligations.",
      "In 1939, when New Mexico was a young, sparsely populated state, it ratified a compact with Texas and Colorado for sharing the waters of the Rio Grande. The agreement defined credits and debits and set parameters for when water could be stored upstream.",
      "From the San Luis Valley in Colorado to below Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico, the compact called for gages to monitor the river, ensuring downstream obligations were met.",
      "Meeting the nearly century-old metrics has become harder as snowpacks shrink in the mountains that feed the Rio Grande. Thirsty soil soaks up more snowmelt and runoff before it reaches tributaries, warmer temperatures fuel evaporation, and summer rainy seasons that once boosted flows and recharged reservoirs are more erratic.",
      "The equation is further complicated by growing populations. The Rio Grande provides drinking water for about 6 million people and helps to irrigate millions of acres of cropland in the U.S. and in Mexico.",
      "While the Colorado River gets all the headlines, experts say the situation along the Rio Grande is just as dire.",
      "The proposed settlements would provide a detailed accounting system for sharing water with Texas.",
      "New Mexico could rely on credits and debits from year to year to navigate through drought and wet periods, though it could be responsible for additional water-sharing obligations if deliveries are deferred too long.",
      "The international group Sustainable Waters is wrapping up an extensive study on how the river's water is being used.",
      "Brian Richter, the group's president, said that over the last couple of decades, New Mexico has lost more than 70% of its reservoir storage along the river while groundwater has been extracted faster than it can be replenished. Add to that New Mexico has fallen behind in its water deliveries to Texas.",
      "Richter called it a triple whammy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely in a precarious situation and it\u2019s going to become more challenging going forward,\" he said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s going to require sort of a major reenvisioning of what we want New Mexico\u2019s water future to look like.\u201d",
      "The parties in the case say the proposed agreements will facilitate investments and innovation in water conservation.",
      "\u201cThe whole settlement package really provides for the long-term vitality, economic vitality, for the communities in both New Mexico and Texas,\" said Hannah Riseley-White, director of the Interstate Stream Commission.",
      "New Mexico would have two years to adopt a plan to manage and share water along its southernmost stretch of the Rio Grande. The state can still pump some groundwater while monitoring aquifer levels.",

      "Aside from a changing climate, water managers say the inability to store water in upstream reservoirs due to compact obligations exacerbates the problem.",
      "Many of the intricacies of managing the Rio Grande are as invisible to residents as the water itself.",
      "Sisters Zoe and Phoebe Hughes set out to take photos during a recent evening, anticipating at least a sliver of water like usual. Instead they found deep sand and patchwork of cracked, curled beds of clay.",
      "\u201cIt's so dystopian. It's sad,\u201d Phoebe Hughes said, adding that the river isn't so grand now.",
      "Looking for a silver lining, the two collected pieces of riverbed clay, hoping they could fashion it into something. Other curious visitors played in the sand and walked dogs.",
      "Downstream, Elephant Butte stands at less than 4% of capacity. The reservoir is an irrigation lifeline for farmers, fuels a hydropower station and serves as a popular recreation spot.",
      "The settlements call for reducing groundwater depletions to a rate of 18,200 acre-feet per year. While that's about one-sixth of the drinking water supplied to New York City each day, for the arid West, it\u2019s a monumental amount.",
      "New Mexico officials expect to achieve most of those reductions from buying water rights from willing sellers, meaning more than 14 square miles (36 square kilometers) of farmland would be retired.",
      "Many details \u2014 and the price tag \u2014 have yet to be worked out, the general counsel for the New Mexico state engineer's office told state lawmakers this month. The Legislature in 2023 set aside $65 million toward the settlements and related infrastructure projects, and the state is tapping additional federal dollars. But it will still need more funds, experts say.",
      "Riseley-White said it will take a combination of efforts, including long-term fallowing programs, water conservation and more efficient irrigation infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t one answer. It\u2019s going to be necessarily an all-of-the-above approach,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there will be less water in the future.",
      "Attorney Sam Barncastle, who worked for years on behalf of irrigators, worries small farming operations and backyard gardeners could ultimately be pushed out.",
      "\u201cFarmland does not come back once it's gone,\u201d she said.",
      "The overall idea is to avoid abruptly curtailing water for users, but farmers in southern New Mexico have concerns about how much water will be available and who will be able to use it.",
      "New Mexico is the nation's No. 2 pecan producer, and the sprawling orchards would die without consistent water. The state also is home to world-renowned chilies \u2014 a signature crop tightly woven into New Mexico's cultural identity.",
      "Ben Etcheverry, a board member of the New Mexico Chile Association, said farmers have transitioned to drip irrigation to save water and energy but are continually told they have to do more with even less water and pay higher rates.",

      "Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom.",
      "This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007.",
      "While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism.",
      "But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again.",

      "And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion.",

The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion.",

Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand.",

      "And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a $1.2 billion contract to build and operate what's expected to become the nation&rsquo;s largest immigration detention complex to a tiny Virginia firm with no experience running correction facilities",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a $1.2 billion contract to build and operate what's expected to become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex to a tiny Virginia firm with no experience running correction facilities",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation\u2019s largest immigration detention complex, it didn\u2019t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.",
      "Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.",
      "The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.",
      "The secretive \u2014 and brisk \u2014 contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government\u2019s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.",
      "A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far too easy for standards to slip,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. \u201cPrivate facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.\u201d",
      "Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.",
      "\u201cThe lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,\u201d he said.",
      "Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company\u2019s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp\u2019s construction, citing the litigation over the company\u2019s qualifications.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.",
      "Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.",
      "The camp has drawn comparisons to \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.",
      "The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida\u2019s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.",
      "At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.",
      "Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.",

      "A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.",
      "The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it's classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.",
      "Though Trump's administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities.

      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in November. The platforms have a year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "To critics, though, age check laws raise \u201csignificant privacy and speech concerns, not only for young people themselves, but also for all users of the internet,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cBecause the only way to make sure that we are age verifying anyone under the age of 18 is to also age verify everyone over the age 18. And that could have significant impacts on the speech and privacy rights of adults.\u201d",
      "The state laws are a hodgepodge of requirements, but they generally fall into two camps. On one side are laws \u2014 as seen in Louisiana and Texas \u2014 that require websites comprised of more than 33% of adult content to verify users' ages or face fines. Then there are laws \u2014 enacted in Wyoming or South Dakota \u2014 that seek to regulate sites that have any material that is considered obscene or otherwise harmful to minors.",
      "What's considered harmful to minors can be subjective, and this is where experts believe such laws run afoul of the First Amendment. It means people may be required to verify their ages to access anything, from Netflix to a neighborhood blog.",
      "\u201cIn places like Australia and the U.K., there is already a split happening between the internet that people who are willing to identify themselves or go through age verification can see and the rest of the internet. And that's historically a very dangerous place for us to end up,\u201d said Jason Kelley, activism director at the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "What's behind the gates is determined by a \u201chundred different decision-makers,\" Kelley said, from politicians to tech platforms to judges to individuals who have sued because they believe that a piece of content is dangerous.",

      "While many companies are complying, verifying users' ages can prove a burden, especially for smaller platforms. On Friday, Bluesky said it will no longer be available in Mississippi because of its age verification requirements. While the social platform already does age verification in the U.K., it said Mississippi\u2019s approach \u201cwould fundamentally change how users access Bluesky.\u201d",
      "That's because it requires every user to undergo an age check, not just those who want to access adult content. It would also require Bluesky to identify and track users that are children.",
      "\u201cWe think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms,\u201d the company said in a blog post.",
      "Some websites and social media companies, such as Instagram's parent company Meta, have argued that age verification should be done by app store owners, such as Apple and Google, and not individual platforms. This would mean that app stores need to verify their users\u2019 ages before they allow them to download apps. Unsurprisingly, Apple and Google disagree.",
      "\u201cBilled as \u2018simple\u2019 by its backers, including Meta, this proposal fails to cover desktop computers or other devices that are commonly shared within families. It also could be ineffective against pre-installed apps,\u201d Google said in a blog post.",
      "Nonetheless, a growing number of tech companies are implementing verification systems to comply with regulations or ward off criticism that they are not protecting children. This includes Google, which recently started testing a new age-verification system for YouTube that relies on AI to differentiate between adults and minors based on their watch histories.",
      "Instagram is testing a similar AI system to determine if kids are lying about their ages. Roblox, which was sued by the Louisiana attorney general on claims it doesn't do enough to protect children from predators, requires users who want to access certain games rated for those over 17 to submit a photo ID and undergo a face scan for verification. Roblox has also recently begun requiring age verification for teens who want to chat more freely on platform.",
      "Face scans that promise to estimate a person\u2019s age may address some of the concerns around IDs, but they can be unreliable. Can AI accurately tell, for instance, if someone is 17.5 or just turned 18?",
      "\u201cSometimes it\u2019s less accurate for women or it\u2019s less accurate for certain racial or ethnic groups or for certain physical characteristics that then may mean that those people have to go through additional privacy invasive screenings to prove that they are of a certain age,\u201d Huddleston said.",
      "While IDs are a common way of verifying someone\u2019s age, the method raises security concerns: What happens if companies don't delete the uploaded files, for instance?",
      "Case in point: the recent data breaches at Tea, an app for women to anonymously warn each other about the men they date, speak to some of these concerns. The app requires women who sign up to upload an ID or undergo a scan to prove that they are women. Tea wasn't supposed to keep the files but it did, and stored them in a way that allowed hackers to not only access the images, but also their private messages.",

      "Officials executed 14 search and seizure warrants and 14 preventive arrest warrants, resulting in five arrests, in what Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said was one of the largest operations against organized crime in the country\u2019s history.",
      "Federal authorities did not name any specific individuals or companies targeted, citing sealed and ongoing investigations. However, state prosecutors in Sao Paulo, who contributed to the operation, said the scheme involved members of the First Capital Command crime syndicate, or PCC.",

      "Authorities identified 40 investment funds with a combined asset value of 30 billion reais (about $5.5 billion). These funds were allegedly used to shield assets for criminal organizations, holding properties such as a port terminal, four ethanol plants and about 1,000 gas stations across 10 Brazilian states. The fuel sector was chosen as a starting point by investigators into the criminal networks because it was the most visible one, they said.",
      "\u201cPeople know how it has worked, but it took a national effort to reach the heart of the problem and be able to confront it,\u201d Finance Minister Fernando Haddad told journalists.",

      "\u201cThis affects the entire supply chain \u2014 from fuel importation, production, distribution and commercialization,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cIn the financial sector, it involves asset concealment and shielding, in schemes similar to the hiding of shareholders in offshore tax havens. The Brazilian state cannot allow this to happen.\u201d",
      "Sao Paulo's State Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office said its investigation found that criminal organizations used adulterated fuel at more than 300 gas stations to launder illegal money through a complex network of intermediaries, including shell companies, investment funds and payment institutions.",
      "\u201cA significant portion of the unbacked funds was used to acquire ethanol plants and expand the group\u2019s criminal operations, which now include fuel distributors, transport companies and gas stations,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "The fraud also involved irregular imports of methanol through the Port of Paranagua, in Parana state. The methanol was not delivered to the recipients listed on invoices but instead sent to gas stations and distributors, where it was used to adulterate fuel.",

      "Wholesale prices on the St. Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange for A-95 gas \u2014 the highest octane \u2014 spiked to record highs last week, soaring to about 50% higher than in January, as demand soared from farmers seeking to bring in the harvest and Russians hitting the roads for their last big vacation of the summer.",
      "Russian media outlets reported fuel shortages are hitting consumers in several regions in the Far East and on the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed from Ukraine by Moscow in 2014.",
      "Media outlets in the Primorye region, which borders North Korea, reported long lines and prices of about 78 rubles per liter (approximately $3.58 per gallon) at gas stations in the area, where the average monthly wage is about $1,200. Journalists at local news outlet Primpress found other drivers trying to sell gas online for as much as 220 rubles per liter (about $10.12 per gallon).",
      "In the Kurilsky district of the Kuril Islands north of Japan, shortages of lower octane A-92 gas forced officials to halt public sales outright Monday. In Crimea, a popular resort area, some companies sold fuel only to holders of coupons or special cards.",
      "Russia is no stranger to gasoline price increases at the end of summer. But this year's shortages have been aggravated by Ukraine\u2019s attacks on oil refineries in the 3 1/2-year-old war. Larger, more concentrated attacks are causing more damage and hampering production, all timed to coincide with peak demand.",
      "Ukraine has targeted energy infrastructure before, but the recent strikes have been more successful, with more drones targeting a more concentrated group of facilities.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians are attacking an arc of refineries, starting from Ryazan, which is south of Moscow, all the way to Volgograd. That region is where people are driving through on their way to (resorts on) the Black Sea. That\u2019s the region where most of the harvest operations are going on. And that\u2019s also a rather densely populated region,\u201d Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told The Associated Press.",
      "Between Aug. 2 and Aug. 24, Ukraine attacked oil infrastructure at least 12 times, according to media reports. Of those attacks, at least 10 were targeting sites in the Ryazan-Volgograd arc in southwestern Russia.",
      "These attacks have damaged many oil refineries but have not destroyed them outright, Vakulenko said, adding that most of the facilities are extremely resilient against fires.",
      "But they can slow refinery activity, as shown by a fall in the intake of crude oil to be turned into diesel, gasoline or other products by roughly 200,000 to 250,000 barrels per day, said Gary Peach, oil markets analyst at Energy Intelligence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just enough to make their gasoline industry feel some pain, especially during the high consumption months in the summer,\u201d he told AP. Gasoline production fell 8.6% in the first 19 days of August, compared with a year earlier, and diesel production was down 10.3%.",
      "Other war-related issues have caused even more consumer pain. Ukrainian drone strikes repeatedly have disrupted Russian transportation networks, particularly air traffic, causing more people to travel by car and increasing demand for gas, Vakulenko said.",
      "Inflation also has made it less profitable for suppliers who normally buy gasoline early in the year for sale in the higher-priced summer months, and many entrepreneurs simply decided not to bother this year, he said.",

      "Yet Russia is not at immediate risk of grinding to a halt \u2014 even in more vulnerable regions, experts say. Although private drivers may feel some pain at the gas pump, most buses and trucks run on diesel, for which Russia has a surplus.

      "A case that could provide the Trump administration with new and expansive power over the traditionally independent Federal Reserve will get its first court hearing Friday",
      "A case that could provide the Trump administration with new and expansive power over the traditionally independent Federal Reserve will get its first court hearing Friday.",
      "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has requested an emergency injunction to block President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud when she purchased a home and condo in 2021. She was appointed to the Fed's board by former president Joe Biden in 2022.",
      "If her firing is allowed to stand, it would likely erode the Fed's longstanding independence from day-to-day politics. No president has ever fired a Fed governor in the agency's 112-year history. Economists broadly support Fed independence because it makes it easier for the central bank to take unpopular steps such as raising interest rates to combat inflation.",
      "Cook has asked the court to issue an emergency order that would block Trump's firing of her and enable her to remain on the seven-member board of governors while her lawsuit seeking to overturn the firing makes its way through the courts. Many observers expect her case will end up at the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The law governing the Fed says the president can't fire a governor just because they disagree over interest rate policy. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, reduce its key interest rate, which is currently 4.3%. Yet the Fed has kept it unchanged for the last five meetings.",
      "But the president may be able to fire a Fed governor \u201cfor cause,\u201d which has traditionally been interpreted to mean inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Cook's lawyers argue that it also refers only to conduct while in office. They also say that she was entitled to a hearing and an opportunity to rebut the charges.",
      "\u201cThe unsubstantiated and unproven allegation that Governor Cook \u2018potentially\u2019 erred in filling out a mortgage form prior to her Senate confirmation \u2014 does not amount to \u2018cause,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Trump has moved to fire a number of leaders from a host of independent federal regulatory agencies, including at the National Transportation Safety Board, Surface Transportation Board, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as the Fed.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to temporarily block the president from firing directors of some independent agencies earlier this year while those cases move through the courts. Legal experts say the high court this year has shown more deference to the president's removal powers than it has in the past.",

      "As a governor, Cook votes on all the Fed's interest rate decisions and helps oversee bank regulation. The Fed has substantial power over the economy by raising or cutting its key interest rate, which can then influence a broad range of other borrowing costs, including mortgages, car loans, and business loans.",
      "Bill Pulte, Trump's appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, first leveled the accusation against Cook that she has committed mortgage fraud.",
      "It's a charge he has also made against two of Trump's biggest political enemies, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has prosecuted Trump. Pulte has ignored a similar case involving Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who is friendly with Trump and is running for Senate in his state\u2019s Republican primary.",
      "Cook's lawsuit responds by arguing that the claims are just a pretext \u201cin order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve.\u201d",
      "If Trump can replace Cook, he may be able to gain a 4-3 majority on the Fed\u2019s governing board. Trump appointed two board members during his first term and has nominated a key White House economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to replace Adriana Kugler, another Fed governor who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1. Trump has said he will only appoint people to the Fed who will support lower rates.",

      "Coco Gauff kept wiping the tears welling in her eyes between points in her second-round match at the U.S. Open",
      "NEW YORK -- This would not have been easy for anyone, and it was not easy for Coco Gauff. She is aware of the expectations of others. She has her own expectations, too, of course.",
      "An exit in the second round of the U.S. Open on Thursday night simply would not do. And double-faulting her way to defeat might just be the worst possible scenario. So after she missed two consecutive serves to get broken and fall behind in the opening set against Donna Vekic in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Gauff felt overwhelmed and couldn't hide it.",
      "The tears came. They wouldn't stop. She covered her face with a towel on the sideline. When she walked back out on court after the changeover, Gauff kept dabbing at her eyes between points, trying to focus, trying to figure out a way to win. After she did just that, straightening out her serving issues in the second set and eliminating Vekic 7-6 (5), 6-2, Gauff cried some more.",
      "\u201cI just show people what it\u2019s like to be a human, and I have bad days, but I think it\u2019s more about how you get up after those bad moments and how you show up after that,\u201d said Gauff, who is seeded No. 3 at Flushing Meadows, where she won the first of her two Grand Slam titles in 2023. \u201cI think today I showed that I can get up after feeling the worst I\u2019ve ever felt on the court.\u201d",
      "Her serving woes resurface from time to time, including when 19 double-faults contributed to a loss that ended her title defense in New York a year ago. She leads the tour with more than 300 double-faults this season \u2014 23 in one match not long ago \u2014 and hired biomechanics expert Gavin MacMillan, credited with rebuilding No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka\u2019s serve, shortly before this U.S. Open.",
      "MacMillan altered the way Gauff hits serves, and she's been smacking so many in practice over the past week that her shoulder aches.",
      "\u201cThe biggest challenge is just changing the motion and changing everything before such a big tournament for me,\" Gauff said. \"This is one of the most nervous tournaments for me in general, and on top of all this, it\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "In the first round, she needed three sets to get past Ajla Tomljanovic, in part because of double-faults.",
      "But like in that match, Gauff\u2019s defense and superiority at the baseline carried her past Vekic.",
      "What left her as emotional as she was Thursday?",
      "\u201cIt was just nerves and just pressure, honestly, and I\u2019m someone that usually can thrive on that. There's been a lot on me this tournament, more than usual, which I expected coming in,\u201d Gauff explained. \u201cBasically, what you saw out there was what it was, and I was able to reset through it. But it was a challenging moment for me on the court. It's been a tough couple of weeks on and off the court, but I\u2019m just happy to get through it today.\u201d",
      "Vekic, who beat Gauff at the Paris Olympics last year en route to the silver medal, took a medical timeout to have her right shoulder looked at late in the first set and was having plenty of serving woes of her own. She double-faulted 10 times.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone that says they don\u2019t get nervous because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, and I think it would be a bit weird if you weren\u2019t nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately the nerves can be good or bad and it\u2019s how you manage it that decides that. I think for me, being calm is part of who I am, but definitely I\u2019ve learned through the years that is how I get the most out of myself as well.\u201d",
      "Despite the break, Norris remained F1's in-form driver as he went fastest in the first practice session by the surprisingly large margin of 0.292 seconds from Piastri. Lance Stroll was an unexpected third for Aston Martin, half a second off the pace.",
      "Verstappen's home race got off to a bad start as the four-time champion ended the first practice stuck in the gravel in bizarre circumstances, sliding off the track at the first corner after attempting a practice start. He was sixth fastest in the session but almost a second off the pace.",
      "Ferrari struggled, with Charles Leclerc 14th and Lewis Hamilton 15th, while Kimi Antonelli caused a red flag when he was beached in the gravel after skidding off in his Mercedes.",

      "That prompted questions of how the situation fit McLaren's stated aim of letting its drivers race each other for the title. Typically, the driver in the lead would get the preference on strategy.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- It is rare for a sports broadcasting figure to retire on his own terms or to be able to accept the tributes or adulation of colleagues and fans.",
      "Lee Corso gets to experience that on Saturday.",
      "Corso makes his final appearance as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d crew before No. 3 and reigning national champion Ohio State hosts top-ranked Texas.",
      "Since announcing his retirement earlier this year, Corso has received his share of acclaim and send-offs. He was honored at the ESPY Awards in July and received a standing ovation before boarding his flight in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gamut of different emotions. I\u2019m trying to stay in the celebratory lane this weekend,\u201d said GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit, who has sat next to Corso since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be emotional or sad when it\u2019s his last show. We can be sad next week. But this weekend, we need to be celebrating him. Everything he\u2019s meant to us and to the sport.\u201d",
      "Corso, who turned 90 on Aug. 7, has been a part of \u201cGameDay\u201d since its start in 1987 and has made pregame shows entertaining under a simple philosophy: \u201cFootball is just the vehicle. It\u2019s entertainment, sweetheart.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost everyone, no matter what they accomplish in our industry, sort of gets dragged out boots first. They don\u2019t really get a chance to say farewell,\u201d GameDay host Rece Davis said on Friday after a production meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s a real blessing that we\u2019re able to give Lee his flowers on a day when he\u2019s feeling great, doing great, and excited for a game.\u201d",
      "GameDay\u2019s 26th appearance in Columbus also marks a full-circle moment for Corso. It was outside Ohio Stadium on Oct. 5, 1996, where Corso\u2019s popular headgear prediction segment began.",
      "Corso donned Brutus Buckeye\u2019s head before Ohio State faced Penn State, and the rest is history.",
      "Corso has worn 69 different schools\u2019 mascot headgear and has dressed up as Notre Dame\u2019s Fighting Irish leprechaun, the Stanford tree, and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. However, Brutus remains Corso\u2019s first love, wearing it 45 times.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the schedule, the obvious place was to try to go to Tallahassee, where he played (at Florida State), but this game is so big. The fact that it\u2019s a noon game. It became a no-brainer to have it here,\u201d Herbstreit said. \u201cIt is very kind of storybook. The fact that we started with this and and end it here in Columbus.\u201d",
      "Corso has a 66.5% winning rate on his headgear predictions (286-144), which is much better than his 73-85-6 mark in 15 years as a coach at Louisville, Indiana, and Northern Illinois.",
      "His final headgear pick will be on the field at Ohio Stadium. Besides airing across all of ESPN\u2019s networks, Fox Sports may show part of it. The final hour of both pregame shows will also take place in the Horseshoe.",

Arnold was originally a five-star recruit out of Denton Guyer High School in Texas, only about 120 miles from the Baylor campus. While shifty with his feet, both on scrambles and direct runs, he did complete 11 of 17 passes for 108 yards.",

      "FRISCO, Texas -- Brian Schottenheimer will make his head coaching debut with the Dallas Cowboys a week after losing elite pass rusher Micah Parsons, probably his best player, in a trade with Green Bay.",
      "The longtime NFL assistant and son of the late Marty Schottenheimer, a 200-game winner in the league, doesn't seem inclined to blink, even in the face of the NFL opener in prime time against defending champ and NFC East rival Philadelphia on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI stared right down the barrel of the gun and said, \u2018Hey, I want to win a Super Bowl,\u2019\u201d Schottenheimer said Friday, a day after the blockbuster deal. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t change. We get excited about the pieces that we\u2019re adding. I don\u2019t sit around and think about, \u2018Man, this is my first year as the head coach.\u2019 This is part of the business. I\u2019m comfortable with that.\u201d",
      "The immediate piece is defensive tackle Kenny Clark, a nine-year veteran on the verge of his 30th birthday and coming off a season that was less productive than unusual as he played through a toe injury. The longer-term payoff is an extra pair of first-round picks over the next two years.",
      "Owner and general manager Jerry Jones said the Cowboys decided long ago they might want to fortify a porous run defense in a deal involving Parsons if they couldn't agree on a contract extension for the 2021 AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year, who was introduced in Green Bay on Friday.",
      "That's the message Clark got when he talked to Jones, who flew the three-time Pro Bowler to his new football home on his private jet.",
      "\u201cThat this trade wasn\u2019t getting done unless I was in it,\u201d Clark said of what Jones told him. \u201cThat made me feel wanted right there. I\u2019m happy to be here. I\u2019m blessed.\u201d",
      "Clark says he hopes to play against the Eagles, who eliminated Clark's Packers in the wild-card round last January. While he brings a reputation as a community-oriented player, Clark said he can't get caught up in trying to ease the pain for a fan base bummed over losing a popular and productive player.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not my concern,\u201d Clark said. \u201cMy concern is come here, play football, be the best defensive tackle I can be and play ball.\u201d",
      "Clark didn't participate in practice, instead taking the field after his teammates were already there, walking alongside linebacker DeMarvion Overshown, who is on the physically unable to perform list while rehabbing a knee injury.",
      "Clark, who spent his first nine seasons with the Packers after they drafted him in the first round in 2016, was in shorts and wearing his new No. 96. He wore No. 97 in Green Bay.",
      "\u201cLike I said, it was shocking,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have much to say to nobody. Everything just happened so fast. It is what it is. I\u2019m here. This franchise will get everything I got.\u201d",

      "The locker room was mostly empty after Clark's 15-minute session with reporters, but two young defensive ends who considered Parson a mentor were still there.",
      "Donovan Ezeiruaku, a rookie second-round pick who left a strong impression in his first training camp, was upbeat. Marshawn Kneeland, a promising second-year player, was a bit more subdued. They didn't gloss over the emotions of the previous day.",
      "\u201cI feel like I speak for a lot of the guys, obviously, being surprised, being like, \u2018Whoa, that\u2019s our guy,\u2019\u201d Kneeland said. \u201cBut we had meetings with coaches and they tell us, \u2018Hey, this is football.\u2019 All of us get that opportunity to go up there and prove, yeah, we\u2019re great, too.\u201d",
      "Schottenheimer prides himself on communicating with players, and said he was quick to get on the phone with several after the trade went down.",
      "Among them was cornerback Trevon Diggs, who displayed his bond with Parsons by being his unofficial spokesman as Parsons declined to speak with reporters almost the entire offseason, save for one day early in training camp in California.",
      "Diggs' emoji of choice for X after the trade was a broken heart. Receiver CeeDee Lamb picked the cying emoji. Neither star player was in the locker room when it was open to reporters the day after the deal.",

      "Both trades happened after failed contract talks and featured two first-round picks in return, although Dallas also got defensive tackle Kenny Clark from the Packers.",
      "That 2018 trade didn't ultimately work out for either team. Mack was highly productive in Chicago, earning All-Pro honors his first year, but couldn't do enough to help the Bears win a playoff game in his four seasons before being traded to the Chargers.",
      "The Raiders used the first pick on running back Josh Jacobs, who was very productive before leaving as a free agent following the 2023 season. The second first-rounder was wasted on cornerback Damon Arnette, who was cut halfway through his second season.",
      "Here's a look at some other NFL stars who were traded in their primes:",
      "The most famous trade in Dallas history came in Jerry Jones' first season as owner in 1989 when the Cowboys dealt Herschel Walker to Minnesota for a package that ultimately led to eight draft picks, including three first rounders. Dallas used those picks to help draft Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith and key contributors to three Super Bowl wins like Darren Woodson, Kevin Smith and Russell Maryland.",
      "The Vikings didn't win a playoff game in two-plus seasons with Walker.",
      "Jones has another famous deal that helped fuel Dallas' 1990s dynasty when he acquired pass rusher from San Francisco for second- and third-round picks in 1992. Haley was the final piece on defense the Cowboys needed to win three Super Bowls in his first four seasons, eliminating the 49ers in the NFC title game on the way to the first two titles.",
      "Moss was a three-time All-Pro and the most dominant deep threat in the league when Minnesota traded him to Oakland in 2005 for a package that included the No. 7 overall pick in the draft. The deal helped neither team as the Vikings used the pick on Troy Williamson, who caught 79 passes in three seasons, and the Raiders won six games in two seasons.",

      "It is impossible to tell who posted the images. Telegram is blocked in China, which allows only apps that cooperate with the government\u2019s censorship apparatus. Users can access Telegram via a virtual private network, which provides an encrypted connection. And Telegram doesn't verify the identity of users.

      "WASHINGTON -- A Social Security official who has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging the Department of Government Efficiency officials mishandled Americans' sensitive information says he's resigning his post because of actions taken against him since making his complaint.",
      "Charles Borges, the agency's chief data officer, alleged that more than 300 million Americans\u2019 Social Security data was put at risk by DOGE officials who uploaded sensitive information to a cloud account not subject to oversight. His whistleblower disclosure was submitted to the special counsel\u2019s office on Tuesday.",
      "In a letter to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, Borges claimed that since filing his whistleblower complaint, the agency's actions make his duties \u201cimpossible to perform legally and ethically\u201d and have caused him \u201cphysical, mental and emotional distress.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter reporting internally to management and externally to regulators, serious data and security and integrity concerns impacting our citizens\u2019 most sensitive personal data, I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,\u201d Borges added.",
      "The Project Government Accountability Office, which is representing him in his whistleblower case, posted Borges' resignation letter on its website Friday evening. Borges declined to comment.",
      "\u201cHe no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience, given what he had witnessed,\u201d his attorney Andrea Meza said in a statement. She added that Borges would continue to work with the proper oversight bodies on the matter.",
      "In his whistleblower's complaint, Borges said the potentially sensitive information put at risk by DOGE's actions includes health diagnoses, income, banking information, familial relationships and personal biographic data.",

    "story": [
      "Oregon lawmakers are considering a proposal that would make the state the second in the nation to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program",
      "Oregon could become the second U.S. state to require electric vehicle owners to enroll in a pay-per-mile program as lawmakers begin a special session Friday to fill a $300 million transportation budget hole that threatens basic services like snowplowing and road repairs.",
      "Legislators failed earlier this year to approve a transportation funding package. Hundreds of state workers' jobs are in limbo, and the proposal for a road usage charge for EV drivers was left on the table.",
      "Hawaii in 2023 was the first state to create a mandatory road usage charge program to make up for projected decreases in fuel tax revenue due to the growing number of electric, hybrid and fuel-efficient cars. Many other states have studied the concept, and Oregon, Utah and Virginia have voluntary programs.",
      "The concept has promise as a long-term funding solution, experts say. Others worry about privacy concerns and discouraging people from buying EVs, which can help reduce transportation emissions.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty major change,\u201d said Liz Farmer, an analyst for The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 state fiscal policy team, noting \u201cthe challenge in enacting something that\u2019s dramatically different for most drivers.\u201d",
      "Oregon's transportation department says the budget shortfall stems from inflation, projected declines in gas tax revenue and other spending limits. Over the summer, it sent layoff notices to nearly 500 workers and announced plans to close a dozen road maintenance stations.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek paused those moves and called the special session to find a solution. Republican lawmakers say the department mismanaging its money is a main issue.",
      "Kotek's proposal includes an EV road usage charge that is equivalent to 5% of the state's gas tax. It also includes raising the gas tax by 6 cents to 46 cents per gallon, among other fee increases.",
      "The usage charge would phase in starting in 2027 for certain EVs and expand to include hybrids in 2028. Should the gas tax increase be approved, EV drivers either would pay about 2.3 cents per mile, or choose an annual flat fee of $340. Drivers in the program wouldn't have to pay supplemental registration fees.",
      "Drivers would have several options for reporting mileage to private contractors, including a smartphone app or the vehicle's telematics technology, said Scott Boardman, policy adviser for the transportation department who works on the state's decade-old voluntary road usage charge program.",
      "As of May, there were over 84,000 EVs registered in Oregon, about 2% of the state's total vehicles, he said.",

      "In 2028, all EV drivers will be required to enroll in the pay-per-mile program, with odometers read at annual inspections. By 2033, the program is expected to expand to all light-duty vehicles.",
      "In past surveys commissioned by Oregon's transportation department, respondents cited privacy, GPS devices and data security as concerns about road usage charges.",
      "Oregon's voluntary program has sought to respond to such concerns by deleting mileage data 30 days after a payment is received, Boardman said. While plug-in GPS devices are an option in the program, transportation officials anticipate moving away from them because they're more expensive and can be removed, he added.",
      "Still, not everyone has embraced a road usage charge. Arizona voters will decide next year whether to ban state and local governments from implementing a tax or fee based on miles traveled after the measure was referred to the ballot by the Republican-majority Legislature.",
      "Many people don't realize that \"both your vehicle and your cellphone capture immense amounts of data about your personal driving habits already,\u201d said Brett Morgan, Oregon transportation policy director for the nonprofit Climate Solutions.",
      "Morgan added that road usage charges exceeding what drivers of internal combustion engines would pay in gas taxes could dissuade people from buying electric and hybrid cars. Already, federal tax incentives for EVs are set to expire under the tax and spending cut bill recently passed by the GOP-controlled Congress.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely supportive of a road usage charge that has EVs paying their fair share, but they should not be paying extra or a penalty,\u201d Morgan said.",

      "Online age checks are on the rise in the U.S. and elsewhere, asking people for IDs or face scans to prove they are over 18 or 21 or even 13. To proponents, they're a tool to keep children away from adult websites and other material that might be harmful to them.",
      "But opponents see a worrisome trend toward a less secure, less private and less free internet, where people can be denied access not just to pornography but news, health information and the ability to speak openly and anonymously.",
      "\u201cI think that many of these laws come from a place of good intentions,\u201d said Jennifer Huddleston, a senior technology policy fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cCertainly we all want to protect young people from harmful content before they\u2019re ready to see it.\u201d",
      "More than 20 states have passed some kind of age verification law, though many face legal challenges. While no such law exists on the federal level in the United States, the Supreme Court recently allowed a Mississippi age check law for social media to stand. In June, the court upheld a Texas law aimed at preventing minors from watching pornography online, ruling that adults don't have a First Amendment right to access obscene speech without first proving their age.",
      "Elsewhere, the United Kingdom now requires users visiting websites that allow pornography to verify their age. Beyond adult sites, platforms like Reddit, X, Telegram and Bluesky have also committed to age checks. France and several other European Union countries also are testing a government sponsored verification app.",
      "And Australia has banned children under 16 from accessing social media.",
      "\u201cPlatforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in November. The platforms have a year to work out how they could implement the ban before penalties are enforced.",
      "To critics, though, age check laws raise \u201csignificant privacy and speech concerns, not only for young people themselves, but also for all users of the internet,\u201d Huddleston said. \u201cBecause the only way to make sure that we are age verifying anyone under the age of 18 is to also age verify everyone over the age 18. And that could have significant impacts on the speech and privacy rights of adults.\u201d",
      "The state laws are a hodgepodge of requirements, but they generally fall into two camps. On one side are laws \u2014 as seen in Louisiana and Texas \u2014 that require websites comprised of more than 33% of adult content to verify users' ages or face fines. Then there are laws \u2014 enacted in Wyoming or South Dakota \u2014 that seek to regulate sites that have any material that is considered obscene or otherwise harmful to minors.",
      "What's considered harmful to minors can be subjective, and this is where experts believe such laws run afoul of the First Amendment. It means people may be required to verify their ages to access anything, from Netflix to a neighborhood blog.",
      "\u201cIn places like Australia and the U.K., there is already a split happening between the internet that people who are willing to identify themselves or go through age verification can see and the rest of the internet. And that's historically a very dangerous place for us to end up,\u201d said Jason Kelley, activism director at the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation.",
      "What's behind the gates is determined by a \u201chundred different decision-makers,\" Kelley said, from politicians to tech platforms to judges to individuals who have sued because they believe that a piece of content is dangerous.",

      "While many companies are complying, verifying users' ages can prove a burden, especially for smaller platforms. On Friday, Bluesky said it will no longer be available in Mississippi because of its age verification requirements. While the social platform already does age verification in the U.K., it said Mississippi\u2019s approach \u201cwould fundamentally change how users access Bluesky.\u201d",
      "That's because it requires every user to undergo an age check, not just those who want to access adult content. It would also require Bluesky to identify and track users that are children.",
      "\u201cWe think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms,\u201d the company said in a blog post.",
      "Some websites and social media companies, such as Instagram's parent company Meta, have argued that age verification should be done by app store owners, such as Apple and Google, and not individual platforms. This would mean that app stores need to verify their users\u2019 ages before they allow them to download apps. Unsurprisingly, Apple and Google disagree.",
      "\u201cBilled as \u2018simple\u2019 by its backers, including Meta, this proposal fails to cover desktop computers or other devices that are commonly shared within families. It also could be ineffective against pre-installed apps,\u201d Google said in a blog post.",
      "Nonetheless, a growing number of tech companies are implementing verification systems to comply with regulations or ward off criticism that they are not protecting children. This includes Google, which recently started testing a new age-verification system for YouTube that relies on AI to differentiate between adults and minors based on their watch histories.",
      "Instagram is testing a similar AI system to determine if kids are lying about their ages. Roblox, which was sued by the Louisiana attorney general on claims it doesn't do enough to protect children from predators, requires users who want to access certain games rated for those over 17 to submit a photo ID and undergo a face scan for verification. Roblox has also recently begun requiring age verification for teens who want to chat more freely on platform.",
      "Face scans that promise to estimate a person\u2019s age may address some of the concerns around IDs, but they can be unreliable. Can AI accurately tell, for instance, if someone is 17.5 or just turned 18?",

      "THE SANTA ROSA PLATEAU ECOLOGICAL RESERVE, Calif. -- The scientist traipses to a pond wearing rubber boots but he doesn\u2019t enter the water. Instead, Brad Hollingsworth squats next to its swampy edge and retrieves a recording device the size of a deck of cards. He then opens it up and removes a tiny memory card containing 18 hours of sound.",
      "Back at his office at the San Diego Natural History Museum, the herpetologist \u2014 an expert in reptiles and amphibians \u2014 uses artificial intelligence to analyze the data on the card. Within three minutes, he knows a host of animals visit the pond \u2014 where native red-legged frogs were reintroduced after largely disappearing in Southern California. There were owl hoots, woodpecker pecks, coyote howls and tree frog ribbits. But no croaking from the invasive bullfrog, which has decimated the native red-legged frog population over the past century.",
      "It was another good day in his efforts to increase the population of the red-legged frog and restore an ecosystem spanning the U.S.-Mexico border. The efforts come as the Trump administration builds more walls along the border, raising concerns about the impact on wildlife.",
      "At 2 to 5 inches long (5 to 13 centimeters), red-legged frogs are the largest native frogs in the West and once were found in abundance up and down the California coast and into Baja California in Mexico.",
      "The species is widely believed to be the star of Mark Twain\u2019s 1865 short story, \u201cThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,\" and their crimson hind legs were eaten during the Gold Rush. But as the red-legged frog declined in numbers, the bullfrog \u2014 with its even bigger hind legs \u2014 was introduced to menus during California's booming growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.",
      "The red-legged frog population was decimated by the insatiable appetite of the bullfrogs and the disease the non-native species brought in, but also because it lost much of its habitat to drought and human development in the shape of homes, dams and more.",
      "Hollingsworth couldn't estimate the number of red-legged frogs that remain, but said they have disappeared from 95% of their historical range in Southern California.",
      "Robert Fisher of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative Program searched for the frog for decades across some 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Los Angeles to the border. He found just one in 2001 and none after that.",
      "Scientists using DNA from red-legged frogs captured in Southern California before their disappearance discovered they were more genetically similar to the population in Mexico than any still in California.",
      "In 2006, Fisher, Hollingsworth and others visited Baja where they had heard of a small population of red-legged frogs. Anny Peralta, then a student of Hollingsworth at San Diego State University, joined them. They found about 20 frogs, and Peralta was inspired to dedicate her life to their recovery.",
      "Peralta and her husband established the nonprofit Fauna del Noroeste in Ensenada, Mexico, which aims to promote the proper management of natural resources. In 2018, they started building ponds in Mexico to boost the frog population that would later provide eggs to repopulate the species across the border.",
      "But just as they were preparing to relocate the egg masses, the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Peralta and the U.S. scientists scrambled to secure permits for the unusual cargo and a pilot to fly the two coolers of eggs closer to the border. The rest of their journey north was by road, after the eggs passed a U.S. border guard inspection.",
      "Over the past five years, Hollingsworth and his team have searched for sounds to prove their efforts to repopulate ponds in Southern California worked.",

      "Herpetologists are building on the AI-powered tools already used to analyze datasets of bird sounds, hoping that it might help build audio landscapes to identify amphibians and track their behavior and breeding patterns, said Zachary Principe of The Nature Conservancy, which is working with the museum on the red-legged frog project. The tools could also help scientists analyze tens of thousands of audio files collected at universities, museums and other institutions.",
      "Scientists working to restore the red-legged frog population in Southern California hope to soon be provided with satellite technology that will send audio recordings to their phones in real time, so they can act immediately if any predators \u2014 in particular bullfrogs \u2014 are detected.",
      "It could also help track the movement of the frogs, which can be difficult to find in the wild, especially because cold-blooded creatures cannot be detected using thermal imagery.",
      "The AI analysis of the pond audio has saved time for Hollingsworth and the others, who previously had to painstakingly listen to countless hours of audio files to detect the calls of the red-legged frog \u2014 which resembles the sound of a thumb being rubbed on a balloon \u2014 over the cacophony of other animals.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tree frogs calling, there\u2019s cows mooing, a road nearby with a motorcycle zooming back and forth,\u201d Hollingsworth said of the ponds' audio landscape. \u201cThere\u2019s owls, there\u2019s ducks splashing, just all this noise\u201d",

Over the years, Mexican gray wolves have returned to their historic range in the southwestern U.S. and in Mexico, while the California Condor now soars over skies from Baja to Northern California.",
      "Based off the latest count, scientists estimate more than 100 adult red-legged frogs are in the Southern California ponds, and tadpoles were spotted at a new site.",
      "The team plans to continue transporting egg masses from Baja, where the population has jumped from 20 to as many as 400 adult frogs, with the hope of building thriving populations on both sides of the border. Already the sites are seeing fewer mosquitos that can carry diseases like dengue and Zika.",
      "A restoration pond in Baja that Peralta\u2019s organization built recently teemed with froglets, their tiny eyes bobbing on its aquatic fern-covered surface. They could, one day, lay eggs for relocation to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey don't know about borders or visas or passports,\u201d Peralta said of the frogs. \u201cThis is just their habitat and these populations need to reconnect. I think this shows that we can restore this ecosystem.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum.",
      "Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom.",
      "This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007.",
      "While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism.",
      "But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again.",

      "And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion.",
      "Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion.",
      "Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand.",
      "Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year.",
      "And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter.",
      "Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country \u2014 a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors.",

      "The study by World Weather Attribution said the fires that killed 20 people, forced 80,000 to evacuate and burned more than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were 22% more intense in 2025, Europe\u2019s worst recorded year of wildfires.",

      "The study found winter rainfall ahead of the wildfires had dropped by about 14% since the pre-industrial era, when a heavy reliance on fossil fuels began. It also determined that because of climate change, weeklong periods of dry, hot air that primes vegetation to burn are now 13 times more likely.",

The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",

      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",

      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

      "McBain said he was \u201crelatively pleasantly surprised\u201d that the three chatbots regularly refused to answer the six highest risk questions.",
      "When the chatbots didn\u2019t answer a question, they generally told people to seek help from a friend or a professional or call a hotline. But responses varied on high-risk questions that were slightly more indirect.",
      "For instance, ChatGPT consistently answered questions that McBain says it should have considered a red flag \u2014 such as about which type of rope, firearm or poison has the \u201chighest rate of completed suicide\u201d associated with it. Claude also answered some of those questions. The study didn't attempt to rate the quality of the responses.",

      "On the other end, Google's Gemini was the least likely to answer any questions about suicide, even for basic medical statistics information, a sign that Google might have \u201cgone overboard\u201d in its guardrails, McBain said.",

      "\u201cYou could see how a combination of risk-aversion lawyers and so forth would say, \u2018Anything with the word suicide, don\u2019t answer the question.\u2019 And that\u2019s not what we want,\u201d said Mehrotra, a professor at Brown University's school of public health who believes that far more Americans are now turning to chatbots than they are to mental health specialists for guidance.",
      "\u201cAs a doc, I have a responsibility that if someone is displaying or talks to me about suicidal behavior, and I think they\u2019re at high risk of suicide or harming themselves or someone else, my responsibility is to intervene,\u201d Mehrotra said. \u201cWe can put a hold on their civil liberties to try to help them out. It\u2019s not something we take lightly, but it\u2019s something that we as a society have decided is OK.\u201d",
      "Chatbots don't have that responsibility, and Mehrotra said, for the most part, their response to suicidal thoughts has been to \u201cput it right back on the person. \u2018You should call the suicide hotline. Seeya.\u2019\u201d",
      "The study's authors note several limitations in the research's scope, including that they didn't attempt any \u201cmultiturn interaction\u201d with the chatbots \u2014 the back-and-forth conversations common with younger people who treat AI chatbots like a companion.",
      "Another report published earlier in August took a different approach. For that study, which was not published in a peer-reviewed journal, researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate posed as 13-year-olds asking a barrage of questions to ChatGPT about getting drunk or high or how to conceal eating disorders. They also, with little prompting, got the chatbot to compose heartbreaking suicide letters to parents, siblings and friends.",
      "The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but \u2014 after being told it was for a presentation or school project \u2014 went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "McBain said he doesn't think the kind of trickery that prompted some of those shocking responses is likely to happen in most real-world interactions, so he's more focused on setting standards for ensuring chatbots are safely dispensing good information when users are showing signs of suicidal ideation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that they necessarily have to, 100% of the time, perform optimally in order for them to be released into the wild,\" he said. \"I just think that there\u2019s some mandate or ethical impetus that should be put on these companies to demonstrate the extent to which these models adequately meet safety benchmarks.\u201d",

      "Climate change is fueling conditions across several states that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers",
      "PAW PAW, Mich. -- Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what's now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.",
      "This year is a different story.",
      "All summer he's been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it's becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, \u2018oh yep, it does look bad,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants\u2019 pollination \u2014 making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.",
      "Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.",
      "Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.",
      "\u201dThe hot nights too, like the corn's never getting a break. It\u2019s just hot all the time,\" Rynd said. \u201cI know it\u2019s wearing on me.\u201d",
      "As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it's consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.",
      "That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he'd only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.",
      "High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen's viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. \"I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,\" said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it's a drier area.",
      "\u201cWe tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,\u201d Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.",
      "He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because \u201cthere's just more variable weather.\"",
      "This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "That, combined with consistent heat, means that \"we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,\" Rippey said.",

He planted his corn and soybeans 60 days behind schedule because it rained nearly every day for two months.",
      "They lost some fertilizer and some plants died in standing water, Good said, but they made up for it with some lucky weather later in the season.",
      "\u201cThe rain does fall in heavier bursts,\u201d Rippey said. He said that can be an issue for farmers because even when it doesn't cause flash floods, the moisture doesn't necessarily percolate into the soil. It runs off and carries fertilizer with it, which is a problem for rivers' health and farmers' pocketbooks.",
      "The trend toward higher humidity levels and warmer ocean temperatures, contributing to hotter nights, could be a bigger issue going forward, putting stress on crops like corn and soybeans, Rippey added.",
      "Late summer is a make-or-break time for farmers: They're trying to gauge how much they'll make from the year's crop and planning their next steps, and patchy pollination doesn't help.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d like to upgrade a tractor ... or we\u2019d maybe try to pick up some more ground,\u201d Rynd said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to want to go do those things when you have a bad year like this.\u201d",
      "When the uncertain pollination is at its worst, if 15% to 25% of every ear of corn doesn't have kernels, that could mean a significant yield loss over a large field, said Nicolle Ritchie, a Michigan State University extension agent who helps Walton and Rynd survey their crops.",
      "Jason Cope co-founded a farm tech company called PowerPollen whose equipment can mechanically collect pollen and then pollinate future crops. He said that due to extreme weather events, the number of \u201crescue\u201d pollination jobs they've done for customers \u2014 to save fields that didn't naturally pollinate very well \u2014 has nearly doubled since they started in 2018.",
      "Walton said he can manage as long as the pollination issues don't get too bad.",

      "Swimming is not advised at many beaches because of unsafe fecal contamination",
      "OGUNQUIT, Maine -- Thousands of Americans will head to beaches for one last summer splash this Labor Day weekend, but taking a dip might be out of the question: Many of the beaches will caution against swimming because of unsafe levels of fecal contamination.",
      "Beaches from Crystal River, Florida, to Ogunquit, Maine, have been under advisories warning about water quality this week because of elevated levels of bacteria associated with fecal waste. The advisories typically discourage beachgoers from going in the water because the bacteria can cause gastrointestinal illness, rashes and nausea.",
      "There have been closures this week at some of the country's most popular beach destinations, including Keyes Memorial Beach in the Cape Cod village of Hyannis in Barnstable, Massachusetts; Benjamin's Beach on Long Island in Bay Shore, New York; and a portion of the Imperial Beach shoreline near San Diego. Even on the pristine, white sand beaches of Hawaii, the Hawaii State Department of Health is warning of a high bacteria count at Kahaluu Beach Park on the Big Island.",
      "It's a longstanding and widespread problem. Nearly two-thirds of beaches tested nationwide in 2024 experienced at least one day in which indicators of fecal contamination reached potentially unsafe levels, conservation group Environment America said in a report issued this summer.",
      "The group reviewed beaches on the coasts and Great Lakes and found that 84% of Gulf Coast beaches exceeded the standard at least once. The number was 79% for West Coast beaches, 54% for East Coast beaches and 71% for Great Lakes beaches.",
      "The report also said more than 450 beaches were potentially unsafe for swimming on at least 25 percent of the days tested. A key reason is outdated water and sewer systems that allows contamination from sewage to reach the places where people swim, said John Rumpler, clean water director and senior attorney with Environment America.",
      "\u201cThese beaches are a treasure for families across New England and across the country. They are a shared resource,\u201d said Rumpler, who is based in Boston. \u201cWe need to make the investment to make sure that literally our own human waste doesn't wind up in the places where we are swimming.\u201d",
      "Other factors have also played a role in contaminating beaches, including increasingly severe weather that overwhelms sewage systems, and suburban sprawl that paves over natural areas and reduces the ecosystem's ability to absorb stormwater, Rumpler said.",
      "But many people plan to jump in the ocean anyway. Despite a two-day warning of elevated fecal indicator bacteria last month at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, beachgoer Yaromyr Oryshkevych was not concerned.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t expect to be in any kind of danger of fecal contamination,\u201d said Oryshkevych, a retired dentist. He said he didn\u2019t think Rehoboth was close enough to notable pollution to be concerned, and he expected the ocean\u2019s natural currents to take care of any problems with contamination in the area.",
      "Dana West, a federal worker visiting Rehoboth Beach, recalled an instance earlier this year where a dozen members of his vacationing party experienced gastrointestinal issues. The symptoms occurred after they went on a snorkeling excursion, an activity that increases the likelihood of swallowing seawater, off the coast of Isla Mujeres, Mexico.",

Fecal bacteria at those levels can cause illness in 32 out of every 1,000 swimmers.",

      "The Delta jet had departed from Los Angeles to Shanghai on Jan. 14, 2020 when it needed to quickly return to Los Angeles International Airport. The Boeing 777-200 landed safely after circling back over Los Angeles while dumping 15,000 gallons of fuel to reach a safe landing weight.",

      "The group reviewed beaches on the coasts and Great Lakes and found that 84% of Gulf Coast beaches exceeded the standard at least once. The number was 79% for West Coast beaches, 54% for East Coast beaches and 71% for Great Lakes beaches.",
      "The report also said more than 450 beaches were potentially unsafe for swimming on at least 25 percent of the days tested. A key reason is outdated water and sewer systems that allows contamination from sewage to reach the places where people swim, said John Rumpler, clean water director and senior attorney with Environment America.",
      "\u201cThese beaches are a treasure for families across New England and across the country. They are a shared resource,\u201d said Rumpler, who is based in Boston. \u201cWe need to make the investment to make sure that literally our own human waste doesn't wind up in the places where we are swimming.\u201d",
      "Other factors have also played a role in contaminating beaches, including increasingly severe weather that overwhelms sewage systems, and suburban sprawl that paves over natural areas and reduces the ecosystem's ability to absorb stormwater, Rumpler said.",
      "But many people plan to jump in the ocean anyway. Despite a two-day warning of elevated fecal indicator bacteria last month at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, beachgoer Yaromyr Oryshkevych was not concerned.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t expect to be in any kind of danger of fecal contamination,\u201d said Oryshkevych, a retired dentist. He said he didn\u2019t think Rehoboth was close enough to notable pollution to be concerned, and he expected the ocean\u2019s natural currents to take care of any problems with contamination in the area.",
      "Dana West, a federal worker visiting Rehoboth Beach, recalled an instance earlier this year where a dozen members of his vacationing party experienced gastrointestinal issues. The symptoms occurred after they went on a snorkeling excursion, an activity that increases the likelihood of swallowing seawater, off the coast of Isla Mujeres, Mexico.",

      "Tennessee authorities say a cold case investigation reveals that a sheriff who inspired a Hollywood movie about an organized crime-busting law enforcement officer actually killed his wife in 1967 and led people to believe she was murdered by his enemies",
      "A late Tennessee sheriff who inspired a Hollywood movie about a law enforcement officer who took on organized crime killed his wife in 1967 and led people to believe she was murdered by his enemies, authorities in Tennessee said Friday.",
      "The finding will likely shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie that immortalized him as a tough but fair sheriff with zero tolerance for crime, authorities said.",
      "There is enough evidence that if then-McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser were alive today, prosecutors would present an indictment to the grand jury for the murder of Pauline Mullins Pusser, said Mark Davidson, the district attorney for Tennessee\u2019s 25th judicial district. Investigators also uncovered signs she suffered from domestic violence.",
      "Prosecutors worked with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which began reexamining decades-old files on Pauline's death in 2022 as part of its regular review of cold cases, agency director David Rausch said. Agents found inconsistencies between Buford Pusser's version of events and the physical evidence, received a tip about a potential murder weapon and exhumed Pauline's body for an autopsy.",
      "Authorities acknowledged the news may shock many who grew up as Buford Pusser's fans and watched the 1973 \u201cWalking Tall\u201d movie he inspired or the 2004 remake. Many officers joined law enforcement because of his story, Davidson said. The sheriff died in a car crash seven years after his wife's death.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about tearing down a legend. It is about giving dignity and closure to Pauline and her family and ensuring that the truth is not buried with time,\u201d Davidson said at a news conference streamed on Facebook. \u201cThe truth matters. Justice matters. Even 58 years later. Pauline deserves both.\u201d",
      "The case dates to Aug. 12, 1967. Buford Pusser got a call in the early morning hours about a disturbance. He reported that his wife volunteered to ride along with him as he responded. Buford Pusser said that shortly after they passed Hope Methodist Church, a car pulled up and fired several times into the vehicle, killing Pauline and injuring the sheriff. Buford Pusser spent 18 days in the hospital and required several surgeries to recover. The case was built largely on his own statement and closed quickly, Rausch said.",
      "During the reexamination of the case, Dr. Michael Revelle, an emergency medicine physical and medical examiner, studied postmortem photographs, crime scene photographs, notes made by the medical examiner at the time and Buford Pusser's statements and concluded that Pauline was actually more likely that not shot outside the car and then placed inside it.",

      "The extent of the change in enrollment will not be clear until the fall, Some groups have forecast a decline of as much as 40%, with a huge impact on college budgets and the wider U.S. economy.",
      "As part of a broader effort to reshape higher education, President Donald Trump has pressed colleges to limit their numbers of international students and heightened scrutiny of student visas. His administration has moved to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian activism, and new student visa appointments were put on hold for weeks as it ramped up vetting of applicants' social media.",
      "On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said it will propose a rule that would put new limits on the time foreign students can stay in the U.S.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, President Donald Trump has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation\u2019s most Democratic cities \u2014 including Chicago and Baltimore \u2014 claiming they are needed to crack down on crime.",
      "The threats to expand a federal intervention have legal experts and some military officials raising concerns that Trump is considering novel ways to use National Guard troops in American cities that could set up conflicts not seen since the civil rights era.",
      "Though most violent crime has fallen in recent years in the cities Trump has called out, the Republican president said Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker \u201cshould be calling me, and he should be saying, \u2018Can you send over the troops please?\u2019 It\u2019s out of control.\u201d",
      "Whether Trump can repeat what he\u2019s done in LA and the nation's capital \u2014 call up the National Guard and have it assist a surge of federal law enforcement and immigration officers \u2014 is an open question and likely to become a point of contention should he press forward.",
      "Here's a look at how Trump has used troops in U.S. cities, what the law allows and what could come next:",
      "Trump first deployed troops to Los Angeles in early June over Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s objections by putting the California National Guard under federal jurisdiction, known as Title 10, to protect federal property from protests over immigration raids.",
      "Besides 4,000 Guard members, Trump later sent 700 active duty Marines, and California sued over the intervention. The Guard went on to help protect officers during immigration arrests.",
      "While Trump pushed the limits of the law, the lawsuit centers on whether the president was allowed to use the Guard to closely shadow federal law enforcement and whether that runs afoul of the prohibition on using the military as law enforcement, known as the Posse Comitatus Act, said Todd Huntley, director of the National Security Law Program at the Georgetown University Law Center.",
      "Meanwhile, the unique status of the District of Columbia National Guard \u2014 Trump is their commander in chief \u2014 means he has been able to use it for everything from armed patrols to trash cleanup without any legal issues. Because it is on state and not federal orders, legal restrictions on law enforcement don\u2019t come into effect.",
      "\u201cWhere we have a big question mark\u201d is whether \u201cthe governor of a state has to consent to the sending of troops to his state,\u201d said Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate.",
      "The Trump administration is planning to surge officers to the nation\u2019s third-largest city for an immigration crackdown, two U.S. officials said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes outside Chicago for support on immigration operations, including with facilities and logistics, the base said this week. The Illinois National Guard and the base said they had not received requests regarding a mobilization of troops to Chicago.",
      "If Trump wants the freedom to use the National Guard as he pleases in Chicago, the easiest legal path is to invoke the Insurrection Act \u2014 a vaguely worded 1792 law that allows the president to deploy federal troops inside the U.S. to conduct law enforcement, an exception to the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act.",

      "However, Huntley calls this \u201cthe nuclear option.\u201d",
      "A D.C. National Guard official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said invoking the Insurrection Act over a broad topic like crime could allow the Guard to be deployed indefinitely.",
      "Another possibility is Trump deploying the D.C. Guard, which he commands, to another state, the official said.",
      "If the D.C. Guard is put on federal orders \u2014 something Trump has the power to do \u2014 it could lead to some rare situations, including federalized D.C. Guardsmen sent to another state that in turn could activate its own Guard as a counter, Huntley said.",
      "The possibility is not without precedent.",
      "\u201cThe resolution of that could be basically what we saw in Alabama during the civil rights era. To take the ability of that state governor of using state National Guard forces away, the president could simply federalize them,\u201d Huntley said.",
      "In 1963, President John F. Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard as part of the now-famous standoff with Gov. George Wallace, who refused to step aside and allow Black students to integrate the University of Alabama. Wallace eventually relented.",
      "In an executive order signed Monday, Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to create \u201ca specialized unit\" within the D.C. Guard \"dedicated to ensuring public safety and order.\u201d",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The federal criminal case against former Memphis police officers charged in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols has taken a shocking, unusual twist: Three of them are getting a new trial because a judge made comments after their convictions that raised questions of bias.",
      "On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman ordered a new trial for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith. They were found guilty in October 2024 of obstruction of justice through witness tampering in the January 2023 beating of Nichols after he fled a traffic stop. Two other officers involved in the beating pleaded guilty and avoided trial.",
      "Lipman wrote that U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris, who presided over the trial, raised \u201cthe risk of bias\u201d when he commented in May that at least one of the officers could be in a gang, and that gang may have been responsible for shooting his law clerk.",
      "Lipman's order also said an assistant U.S. attorney recalled that Norris told her shortly after the shooting that the Memphis Police Department was \u201cinfiltrated to the top with gang members.\u201d",
      "Norris recused himself from the case in June, just days before scheduled sentencings for the five officers. He has declined comment.",
      "If the case heads to trial again, defense attorneys, prosecutors, the officers and Nichols' family will have to relive the brutal beating and the grueling legal battle that has followed. It is unclear when a new trial would take place, again putting Memphis in the spotlight for a death that sparked a federal civil rights investigation into its police.",
      "Here is a look at the case, and what's next.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2023, officers yanked Nichols from his car and then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place steps from his home.",
      "He died in a hospital three days later.",
      "Video of the beating captured by a police pole camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries. It prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, nationwide protests and renewed calls for police reform.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith, along with Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., were fired. They were charged in state court with offenses including second-degree murder and in federal court with civil rights violations and obstructing justice.",
      "Bean, Haley and Smith were convicted in federal court of trying to cover up the beating by failing to say that they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke police department rules when they did not include accurate statements about what type of force they used.",
      "Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges.",
      "Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs, and also conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.",
      "This May, Bean, Haley and Smith were acquitted of all state charges.",
      "Martin and Mills pleaded guilty in federal court last year to violating Nichols\u2019 civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court.",
      "Martin and Mills also avoided a state court trial after reaching agreements to plead guilty.",
      "In her order, Lipman cited a notice by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office about Norris\u2019 reactions to his law clerk being shot during a car theft days after the federal trial ended. The clerk was staying at the home of another law clerk who had previously worked for Norris on the Nichols case, the notice said.",
      "Norris met with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and an FBI agent, who explained why no federal charges would be brought in the shooting.",

      "Norris indicated that he believed at least one of the former officers was in a gang and that it was responsible for the shooting, the notice said. Norris told those present that he believed the intended target of the shooting was the former law clerk who had worked on the case and \u201chad been seen by one or more of the Defendants during the trial,\u201d the notice added.",
      "The assistant U.S. attorney who attended the May 30 meeting recalled that Norris months earlier told her he could not meet with Memphis police to give a statement because the department was \u201cinfiltrated to the top with gang members,\u201d the notice said.",
      "Norris recused himself days after that meeting.",
      "Bean, Haley, and Smith sought a new trial, arguing that Norris was biased and violated their due process rights.",
      "While a review showed Norris\u2019 decisions throughout the trial were \u201csound, fair, and grounded firmly in the law,\u201d a new trial is necessary \u201cbecause the risk of bias here is too high to be constitutionally tolerable,\u201d Lipman wrote.",
      "Lipman has ordered lawyers to state what charges they believe need to be retried, and she set a Sept. 25 hearing.",
      "Charles Geyh, a law school professor at Indiana University and expert in judicial ethics, said it is already rare to get a new trial because of doubts that a judge could hear a case fairly. But Norris\u2019 broad comments make the scenario \u201chighly unusual,\u201d Geyh said.",
      "\u201cIn a case like this, it\u2019s rarer still where the judge steps back and generalizes about the police force and associates them with organized crime and gangs,\u201d Geyh said.",
      "David Raybin, a Nashville criminal defense attorney who has represented police officers, said there could be renewed plea bargaining, potentially for lower offenses, given that the three officers had been convicted on the lesser federal charges and acquitted in state court.",
      "\u201cThey may come to the table and say, \u2018Look, we want a deal, we want a better deal,\u2019 or whatever,\" said Raybin, who is not involved in the case. \"The prosecutors might say, \u2019Look, this case is snakebit. We maybe want to settle this case in some way.' \u201d",
      "Geyh said there\u2019s a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d Norris could publicly apologize.",
      "Geyh also said someone could file a disciplinary complaint. The process could lead to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals chief judge talking privately with Norris, who might agree to some corrective steps, Geyh said.",
      "Or the chief circuit judge could commission an investigative panel, with a judicial council potentially issuing up to a public reprimand, but likely nothing more severe, Geyh added.",
      "Norris already has been reassigned off other cases, including a $550 million lawsuit by Nichols\u2019 family against the five officers and the city of Memphis.",
      "Nichols' family members have not commented publicly on the new trial, and neither has their lawyer, Ben Crump.",
      "But throughout their ordeal, Nichols' relatives have expressed how difficult his death has been. During the trials, Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, and other relatives left the courtroom while jurors watched video of the beating.",
      "After the state court acquittals in May, Crump said: \u201cTyre\u2019s life was stolen, and his family was denied the justice they so deeply deserve. We are outraged, and we know we are not alone.\"",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham, whose feats as a U.S. Navy flying ace during the Vietnam War catapulted him to a U.S House of Representatives career that ended in disgrace when he was convicted of accepting $2.4 million in bribes, has died. He was 83.",
      "Cunningham died Wednesday at a hospital in a Little Rock, Arkansas, according to former Rep. Duncan L. Hunter, who spent time with him a week before his passing.",
      "He \u201crepresented the very best of American heroes who go out to meet our enemies at the gates,\" said Hunter, whose served alongside Cunningham in Congress.",
      "Cunningham was one of the most highly decorated pilots in the Vietnam War, becoming the first Navy fighter ace in the war for shooting down five enemy aircraft. He received a Navy Cross, two Silver Stars, 15 Air Medals and a Purple Heart for his actions during the war.",
      "\u201cWith complete disregard for his own personal safety he continued his attack through a hail of cannon fire to rescue his wingman,\u201d read the citation for his second Silver Star.",
      "He went on to serve eight terms in Congress before pleading guilty in 2005 to receiving illegal gifts from defense contractors in exchange for government contracts and other favors, in what was considered at the time to be the largest bribery scandal in congressional history.",
      "The Republican congressman from San Diego admitted to accepting a luxury house, a yacht, a Rolls-Royce, lavish meals and $40,000 in Persian rugs and antique furniture from companies in exchange for steering lucrative contracts their way. He was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison in March 2006.",
      "His corruption case was one of several that led to the creation of the Office of Congressional Ethics in 2008.",
      "\u201cIn my life, I have known great joy and great sorrow. And now I know great shame,\u201d Cunningham said in his resignation statement. \u201cI cannot undo what I have done. But I can atone.\u201d",
      "He took a less contrite tone as time went on, telling news organizations and others that he regretted his guilty plea and complaining that the Internal Revenue Service was draining his savings.",
      "\u201cA lot of these things that they say are bribes I can absolutely black-and-white prove 100% that they were reimbursement for things that I had already paid,\u201d Cunningham said in a phone interview with KGTV while he was in prison.",
      "In December 2012, Cunningham was released from a federal prison in Arizona to serve the remainder of his sentence in a federal halfway house in New Orleans. It was the longest prison sentence for a member of Congress for taking bribes until Louisiana Democrat William Jefferson got 13 years in 2009.",

He was ordered to pay $1,500 a month in prison and $1,000 monthly after his release.",
      "Cunningham was born in Los Angeles on Dec. 8, 1941, but grew up in Shelbina, Missouri, where his parents owned a five-and-dime store, according to court documents. He graduated from the University of Missouri and a few years later enlisted in the Navy in 1967.",
      "He retired as a Navy commander in 1987 and gained national recognition as a media commentator on military topics. When he ran for office in 1990, he replaced Democratic Rep. Jim Bate in a left-leaning district who had been driven from office by charges of sexual harassment.",
      "Cunningham took an interest in military affairs while in Congress and supported socially conservative positions. He drew attention for his outbursts \u2014 during a floor debate in 1995, he attacked his adversaries as \u201cthe same ones that would put homos in the military.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe brought military operational expertise to the debates in Congress,\u201d said Hunter, recalling a debate he watched Cunningham have with a colleague over the fate of a fighter jet. \u201cHe was a strong conservative, strongly opinionated, and brought a real spark of light to the U.S. Congress.\u201d",
      "The disgraced former congressman received one of the pardons issued by President Donald Trump in 2021 at the end of his first term.",
      "He has largely stayed out of the public eye since his release from prison, enjoying retirement in the countryside and serving as the president of the American Fighter Aces Association, according to Hunter.",

      "The indictments are the first to result from the fuel spill that angered Hawaii residents, lawmakers and military service members and their families. The military decided to close the aging World War II-era fuel tanks after the spill.",
      "A Navy investigation in 2022 found shoddy management and human error caused the leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. The Defense Department's inspector general last year found Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a Pearl Harbor drinking water well. The Navy issued written reprimands to three retired military officers for their roles in the fuel spill.",
      "The indictment returned Thursday alleges John Floyd and Nelson Wu provided the Navy with inaccurate information about a May 2021 spill that occurred six months before the fuel got in the drinking water. The indictment says they caused the Navy to mislead the Hawaii Department of Health about how much fuel leaked from one of the tanks and reassured officers that their information was accurate.",
      "This caused the Navy to tell the department in the months after May that 1,618 gallons (6,125 liters) leaked instead of 20,000 gallons (75,700 liters) and failed to report that it was unable to find 18,000 gallons (68,000 liters), prosecutors say. The indictment alleges Floyd and Wu redacted data from records provided. Floyd and Wu were each indicted on one count of conspiracy and one count of making false statements.",

Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get it all and some flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",

      "It was during a point at 5-3 in the first set that Djokovic raised his racket awkwardly to reach a volley and immediately showed signs that all was not well. He began trying to stretch his back between points and barely ran for one ball that Norrie hit toward a corner.",

      "The move comes weeks after the Muscogee Nation's supreme court ruled that descendants of Black people who were once enslaved by the tribe are entitled to citizenship, striking down a constitutional requirement adopted in the 1970s that citizens be Muscogee \"by blood.\u201d The new ruling opened the door for Freedman descendants to apply for citizenship, however the chief said Thursday that the court had overstepped its authority.",
      "Amending the constitution is a power reserved to the tribal council and a vote of tribal citizens, Hill wrote in his executive order, and the court's decision has \"the potential for creating a constitutional crisis within the Nation.\u201d",
      "Under his executive order, the Muscogee Nation\u2019s citizenship board can keep accepting applications from Freedmen descendants, but should not process them or issue ID cards until the tribal council conducts a review. The council must decided what the new requirements for Freedmen citizenship will be, suggest the needed changes to the tribal constitution, and then adopt those changes, he said.",
      "The dispute centers on the tribe's 1979 constitution, which erased automatic citizenship for descendants of Freedman. The Muscogee Nation is one of five tribes in Oklahoma that practiced slavery, up until an 1866 treaty with the U.S. government in which the tribe abolished slavery and made formerly enslaved people into citizens.",

      "The Education Department said it has offered the school district a chance to voluntarily make that change and others, such as rescinding any policies or guidance allowing students to use bathrooms based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex, within 10 days or risk unspecified enforcement action. It suggested that its federal funding could be cut.",
      "The investigation began after the school district converted a girl\u2019s restroom at East High School into an all-gender restroom while leaving another bathroom on the same floor exclusive to boys in January. The school district has said that was done as a result of a student-led process, and the bathroom had 12-foot (3.6-meter) tall partitions for privacy and security.",
      "The school district later added a second all-gender restroom on the same floor that it said was meant to address concerns of unfairness.",
      "The Education Department said the investigation was first the one involving the law that was undertaken by its Office for Civil Rights under the Trump administration.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has audaciously claimed virtually unlimited power to bypass Congress and impose sweeping taxes on foreign products.",
      "Now a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing sweeping import taxes on almost every country on earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York. But the 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The ruling was a big setback for Trump, whose erratic trade policies have rocked financial markets, paralyzed businesses with uncertainty and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "The court\u2019s decision centers on the tariffs Trump slapped in April on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "Trump on April 2 \u2014 Liberation Day, he called it \u2014 imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.",
      "The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the United States \u2014 and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did \u2014 including the United Kingdom, Japan and the European Union \u2014 and agreed to lopsided deals with Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.",
      "Those that didn't knuckle under \u2014 or otherwise incurred Trump's wrath \u2014 got hit harder earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.",
      "Claiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act by declaring the United States' longstanding trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.",

      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.",
      "In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the President\u2019\u2019 under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.",
      "On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that \u201cit seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.\u201d",
      "A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday\u2019s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \u201cis not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions,\u201d which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.",
      "The government has argued that if Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it\u2019s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \u201cfinancial ruin\u201d for the United States.",
      "It could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.",
      "\u201cWhile existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,\u201d Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.",
      "The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. \u201cIf allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\u201d he wrote on his social medial platform.",
      "Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.",
      "The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority \u2014 Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 \u2014 as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot simply be imposed at the president\u2019s own discretion.",

      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",

      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",

      "A bejeweled Taylor Swift broke Instagram records Tuesday as the pop star and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce announced their engagement in a joint post.",
      "Fans have been eager to learn everything they can about the engagement into the lead-up to this TBD white veil occasion.",
      "Here's what we know so far about your English teacher and gym teacher's engagement:",
      "When did Swift and Kelce get engaged?",
      "The couple announced their engagement on Aug. 26, 13 days after Swift's \"New Heights\" episode dropped. Fans were quick to speculate about when Kelce popped the question \u2014 and they didn't have to wait long before getting a timeline from Kelce's dad Ed, who told News 5 Cleveland that the couple got engaged roughly two weeks ago.",
      "Ed said he was at the Philadelphia Eagles' public practice on Aug. 10 when he got a FaceTime from the newly engaged couple. He told \"The Jimmy & Nath Show\" that Travis had planned to propose next weekend.",
      "\"He was going to make a big production out of it,\" Ed shared, explaining that Travis wanted it to be \"uber special.\"",
      "\"And I told him the same thing [Swift's dad] Scott told him: Asking her is what's going to make it special, not where you do it. You could do it on the side of the road.\"",
      "Ed said Swift's dad told him to \"just get it done.\"",
      "Where did Kelce pop the question?",
      "Kelce proposed on the grounds of his $6 million Missouri home, which he purchased back in 2023. The engagement photos show a dramatic display of flowers adorning an arch and surrounding the couple.",
      "Florist Ashley Greer told People Magazine that the \"enchanted garden\" scene, which featured thousands of flowers, likely cost nearly $40,000. Also featured \u2014 ivy and willow, a likely nod to two songs off Swift's ninth studio album, \"evermore.\"",
      "What do we know about the ring?",
      "Kelce skipped the paper rings and went for a custom old mine brilliant cut in a yellow gold bezel setting. Swift's representative said New York based goldsmith Kindred Lubeck, who specializes in hand engraving, designed the ring.",
      "Old mine brilliant cuts are often boxy shaped with rounded corners and soft curved edges. They usually have 58 large facets and the style dates to the 18th century. The bulky nature of the cut was intended to sparkle by candlelight.",
      "Where it all began",
      "As Swifties and Chief fans alike already know, their relationship began after Kelce's failed attempt to meet Swift at Arrowhead Stadium. He talked about the show in a July 2023 episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast, telling his brother Jason Kelce that he was disappointed that he wasn't able to give her a friendship bracelet he had made with his number on it.",
      "After the episode aired, Swift heard from people close to Kelce, including Chiefs coach Andy Reid, encouraging her to reach out to him. And the rest is history.",
      "On Swift's episode of the \"New Heights\" podcast, which aired Aug. 13 and smashed Guinness World records, she said the friendship bracelet gesture made her feel like she was in a 1980s John Hughes movie.",
      "\"[It's like] he was just standing outside of my window with a boombox just being like, 'I want to date you! Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet! Do you want to date me?'\" she said. \"I was like, 'If this guy isn't crazy \u2026 this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.'\"",
      "\"This podcast has done a lot for me,\" she said. \"This podcast got me a boyfriend.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \"a disgrace and an insult\" to the victims of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced Ukraine's cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media stories quoted Allen as saying he's always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine's Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said it \"strongly condemns\" Allen's participation in the festival, which \"brings together supporters and mouthpieces of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\"",
      "The ministry called it \"a disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\" adding that Allen \"is deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchanges to continue.",
      "\"When it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\" Allen said. \"But, whatever politicians have done, I don't feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\"",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos.",
      "Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kusturica has been open about his support of Putin, including after the invasion. He received an award from Putin and attended a military parade in Moscow earlier this year.",
      "Allen has long had an affinity for Russian literature and history. His 1975 comedy \"Love and Death\" spoofs the fiction of Tolstoy and other 19th century Russian novelists. The title of his 1989 release \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" echoes Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" and also broods over the themes of wrongdoing, justice and guilt.",
      "In the 1972 essay, \"A Brief Guide to Civil Disobedience,\" Allen jokes about the Russian Revolution, writing that the serfs rebelled when they \"finally realized that the Czar and the Tsar were the same person.\"",

    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

      "Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with \"behavioral intervention.\"",

      "The turn to medication often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.",
      "\"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits,\" Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.",
      "Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.",
      "\"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment,\" the researchers concluded.",
      "The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.",
      "\"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication,\" Howard said. \"...But there is actually a lot more than that.

The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "summary": "Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stepped down hours after the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
    "story": [
      "Four senior officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced their resignations in recent days, citing what they described as growing political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccines.",
      "Two of those \u2014 Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases \u2014 stepped down on Wednesday, hours after the White House announced the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez.",
      "Monarez, confirmed by the Senate in late July, was removed less than a month into her tenure. White House spokesman Kush Desai said Monarez \"was not aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again.\" Monarez's attorneys argue the dismissal is unlawful, asserting that only the president can remove a Senate-confirmed director.",
      "On Thursday, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O'Neill was chosen to serve as acting CDC director, several White House officials confirmed to CBS News. And in an internal email sent to CDC staff Thursday evening, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmed O'Neill as the acting CDC director, but did not address Monarez's departure.",
      "\"I am committed to working with you to restore trust, transparency, and credibility to the CDC,\" Kennedy told CDC employees, later writing that \"President Trump and I are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC: Strengthen the public health infrastructure by returning to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases by investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats.\"",
      "Houry and Daskalakis said they had become increasingly uneasy about how vaccine policy was being handled. Both pointed to preparations for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, which recommends vaccine schedules.",
      "Houry said they feared \"some decisions had been made before there was even the data or the science to support those. We are scientists, and that was concerning to us.\"",
      "Daskalakis added that he was \"very concerned that there's going to be an attempt to re-litigate vaccines that have already had clear recommendations with science that has been vetted,\" which he warned could undermine public trust. \"If you can't attack access, then why not attack trust? And that's what I think the playbook is,\" he said.",
      "Both officials cited instances in which evidence reviews were altered or withdrawn. A CDC analysis of thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, was briefly posted before being taken down at HHS's direction. \"If there's something that doesn't line up with the recommendations, then that information will be taken down, and it's not there for the public to see for openness and transparency,\" Houry said.",
      "The two also criticized what they described as a lack of direct communication between CDC scientists and HHS leadership. Daskalakis said his team was never invited to brief Kennedy on topics ranging from measles to COVID.",
      "When asked about Kennedy's calls for \"radical transparency,\" Houry and Daskalakis described learning about changes to the COVID vaccine schedule for children not through internal channels but via social media.",
      "\"The radical transparency manifested itself by a Twitter post, which is how Dr. Houry and I learned that the secretary had mandated the change in the children's vaccine schedule for COVID,\" Daskalakis recalled. \"What is the background that led to that decision? And we were denied access to that information. So, I don't think that that's radically transparent,\" Daskalakis said.",
      "CBS News reached out to HHS for comment on some of the allegations made by Houry and Daskalakis, but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Both officials said they had no jobs lined up when they resigned. Houry described the decision as an effort to raise the alarm about the direction of the agency.",
      "\"For us, this was really sending out a bat signal,\" Houry said. \"We were the very senior scientists and career leaders at CDC. We thought this was the time to stand together and try to do what we could to raise the alarm around public health in our country.\"",
      "Daskalakis said remaining at CDC under current conditions would have made them complicit in what he called the \"weaponization\" of public health.",
      "\"The safety has already been compromised\u2026We are flying blind in the U.S. already. If we continued\u2026we would be complicit and would be facilitating the ability to go from flying blind to actively harming people,\" he said.",
      "Houry emphasized the severity of the moment by noting that she left without a backup plan.",
      "\"My leaving without a job was really just showing how dire the circumstances had become,\" Houry said.",
      "Daskalakis said his decision was also shaped by his medical oath.",
      "\"As a physician, I take the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. I am seeing ideology permeating science in a way that is going to harm children and adults\u2026I think we are seeing things that are happening that are making our country less prepared to be able to respond to the everyday pathogens \u2026but also \u2026 to the next big thing.\"",
      "Both also expressed concerns for their personal safety in the current climate.",
      "\"The environment we live in\u2026 stoked by misinformation, especially from people considered by some to be health authorities, makes me worried for all of us in public health,\" Daskalakis said. \"I am concerned, but that's part of our job\u2026to be brave and continue to speak the truth even when we are outside of the CDC.\"",
      "The resignations came weeks after a shooting outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, which law enforcement linked to COVID misinformation.",
      "Houry said the White House response to the shooting was muted. Kennedy toured the site but later gave an interview expressing distrust of experts. \"That was after the attack. It was based on COVID misinformation. So this is when we were trying to build trust,\" she said.",
      "Daskalakis added that while Kennedy later described mass shootings as a public health crisis, he believed the secretary should address misinformation as a root cause. \"The misinformation about the COVID vaccine that has been documented by the Georgia bureau of investigation as the reason for the shooter at CDC. I would really recommend that the secretary actually do take his own advice and actually address the core problem that led to that shooting as well,\" he said. He also noted that CDC's own gun violence prevention programs had been sharply reduced. \"We talk about violence as a public health problem. It is, and there's things we can do to prevent it. Unfortunately, the majority of that program, the staff are terminated.\"",
      "The firings and resignations have sparked calls for oversight. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for a bipartisan investigation, Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington urged Kennedy's removal, and Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 who voted to confirm Kennedy's appointment as HHC secretary \u2014 said the developments would \"require oversight.\"",
      "The events come as the Food and Drug Administration narrowed eligibility for updated COVID-19 vaccines to older adults and people with risk factors for severe COVID.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, called on the Department of Health and Human Services Thursday to \"indefinitely postpone\" its vaccine advisory committee meeting next month amid a slew of departures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee announced a hearing next Thursday with Secretary Kennedy on President Trump's health care agenda. The proceeding was previously in the works prior to controversy, according to a committee aide, who noted the panel does not have jurisdiction over the CDC.",
      "A handful of congressional Democrats have called for Kennedy to resign or be fired over the mass exodus from the health agency.",
      "\"We cannot let RFK Jr. burn what's left of the CDC and our other critical health agencies to the ground\u2014he must be fired,\" Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement.",
      "The White House defended Kennedy and the decision to terminate Monarez. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said a replacement would be named by the president or the HHS secretary.",
      "\"The secretary asked her to resign \u2013 she said she would and then she didn't, so the president fired her, which he has every right to do,\" Leavitt told reporters. \"If people are not aligned with the president's vision and the secretary's vision to make this country healthy again, then we will gladly show them the door.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:42:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",

      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The top tourism official in Las Vegas says the city hasn't priced out regular travelers, even as July visitor counts fell and casinos took in more from gamblers.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:50:55 -0400",
    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

      "Prices across the U.S. rose at an annual rate of 2.6% last month, according to personal consumption expenditures data released on Friday. That's the same figure as in June, a sign inflation remains persistent. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, inflation in July actually ticked up to 2.9% from a year ago, up from 2.8% in June.",
      "Read on for a breakdown of Friday's PCE report.",
      "How are consumers faring?",
      "The latest PCE data shows that consumer spending rose 0.5% in July, suggesting that Americans are continuing to open their wallets even in the face of economic uncertainty.",
      "But while people continue to spend, many consumers are increasingly having to make trade-offs on what they spend their money on, Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Consumers are trying to push through \u2014 they're doing the best they can, but they're increasingly under pressure, and therefore they're being more cautious with discretionary outlets,\" he said. \"They travel less. They spend less on restaurants, spend more cautiously on transportation.\"",
      "Such caution can augur a deeper slump given that consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity. The closely watched University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, released Friday, showed that Americans are increasingly concerned about inflation.",
      "Although inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in 2022, it remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% annual target. And consumers continue to feel the pain in the form of higher prices for some groceries as well as rising electricity costs. Another key inflation gauge \u2014 the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0\u2014 shows that the price of coffee was up 14.8% from a year ago, while beef and egg costs were 15.5% and 16.4%, respectively.",
      "Are tariffs impacting inflation?",
      "Not yet. In a positive sign, the price of goods, which are most susceptible to tariffs than services, cooled slightly in July, the PCE data shows, decreasing 0.1% from the month prior. That suggests tariffs have had a minimal impact on prices so far.",
      "\"It's not showing up in a goods prices, in the government statistics at least,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "A critical question facing the economy is whether any tariff-induced inflation amounts to a one-time boost to prices or results in a more prolonged increase. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out the scenarios in a\u00a0speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, earlier this month, noting that even if inflation does end up being a \"one-time\" scenario, it will still \"take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, rose 2.9% from a year ago, up slightly from June's 2.8% and the highest since February, according to the report.",
      "The figures illustrate why many Fed officials\u00a0have been wary\u00a0about cutting their benchmark interest rate. While inflation is much lower than the roughly 7% peak it reached three years ago, it remains above the central bank's 2% target.",

Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.",
      "Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note that the rise in the core inflation measure was due to a rise in core services, which rose 0.3% on a monthly basis. That suggests tariffs are having a \"minimal impact on goods prices,\" he wrote.",
      "Incomes rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, boosted by a healthy gain in wages and salaries, the report showed.",
      "\"We continue to expect core PCE inflation to peak at 3.3% at the turn of the year, before then easing to about 2.5% by the end of 2026,\" Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a report.",

      "Mr. Trump \"is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "The president \"ending of the deadly de minimum loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.",

    "summary": "Critics caution U.S. government equity stakes in American companies could lead to cronyism, distorted economics and bad deals for taxpayers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's 10% stake in Intel, announced not long after President Trump had called on the chip maker's CEO to resign, is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike, who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, may have fueled those misgivings, telling CNBC this week that although Intel is a \"very, very special\" circumstance, that \"there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries.\" The possibility of the U.S. acquiring stakes in additional U.S. companies was immediately met with criticism.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Foundation for International Economics, responded immediately to Hassett's comment, posting on X, \"ARE you effing kidding me? We are going past 1984 into Animal Farm territory at this point,\" referring to the George Orwell satirical novel critiquing totalitarianism. \"Did anyone vote for this? Anyone?\"",
      "Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute, predicted that if that happens, the U.S. would see more cronyism, with the result that \"companies will underperform because they know they will be bailed out,\" and \"taxpayers will lose billions.\"",
      "\"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it,\" conservative talk show host Erick Erikson said of the Intel agreement. \"If you're not against socialism overall, guess what? You're going to get socialism. So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy.\"",
      "Why did the U.S. invest in Intel?",
      "Mr. Trump says he'd like to increase chip production in the U.S. and reduce the nation's dependence on chips manufactured overseas. He believes that the investment in Intel will help the U.S. to better position itself to maintain its technological edge over China in the artificial intelligence race. But the U.S. had already invested in Intel through the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, and Mr. Trump and his top administration officials said the U.S. government is owed a return on their investment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said the U.S. is taking a stake \"to ensure that the United States government is making our country wealthy again and is benefitting from some of these deals.\"",
      "\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. \"So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.\"",
      "But Intel has been struggling \u2014 not just for a couple of years, but for decades, said Scott Lincicome, a leading economic and trade policy expert who is a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and has criticized the Intel deal.",
      "Intel prospered in the 1990s and early 2000s, when most personal computers relied on the company's processors. The emergence of competitors like AMD and Intel's own failure to adapt to mobile computing after the 2007 advent of the iPhone clobbered the chipmaker.",
      "And now, as Nvidia and AMD vie for dominance in the AI chip race, Intel has been lagging.",
      "\"Even if you think government should be investing in companies, Intel is not a lean, mean, innovating machine,\" Lincicome said.",
      "The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting company plans to reduce its workforce by 25% by the end of the year. The company said the administration made the $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock because of the government's confidence in the role Intel plays in \"expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "The Biden administration originally said Intel had to meet certain benchmarks to get the taxpayer money, but Mr. Trump removed those goals to buy the stake in Intel.",
      "Peril in partial government ownership",
      "Economic policy experts fear the U.S. stake in Intel will throw open the door to political pressure and cronyism.",
      "Intel warned in a federal filing this week that there \"could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors.\"",
      "Lincicome maintains that Intel was able to obtain a government infusion of cash not on the strength of its operations, but rather because it has the best lobbyists. And this will just lead more companies to vie for investment in the same way, he said.",
      "\"This is one of the problems with government picking winners and losers in industrial policy in general,\" Lincicome said.",
      "He outlined his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post this week.",
      "\"With the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, Intel will face constant pressure to align corporate decisions with the goals of whatever political party is in power,\" Lincicome wrote. \"Will Intel locate or continue facilities \u2014 such as its long-delayed 'megafab' in Ohio \u2014 based on economic efficiency or government priorities? Will it hire and fire based on merit or political connections?\"",
      "Lincicome isn't the only analyst who pointed out that the uncomfortable decisions CEOs make could come into conflict with U.S. prerogatives if the country holds a stake in their\u00a0 companies.",
      "\"There are major risks to these companies,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, while acknowledging it isn't yet clear what the Trump administration is planning for any future investments. \"A lot of the things that companies need to do in order to stay competitive in the market are politically unpopular,\" like layoffs. \"It's going to be a lot harder for these companies to engage in those painful but necessary moves if the president feels like they would create a political vulnerability for him.\"",
      "Companies without U.S. investment will feel pressure, too, said Di Martino. A company that needs semiconductor chips may decide to buy from Intel because it doesn't want to lose government contracts.",
      "The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use industrial policy in other ways that depart from free market economic principles long favored by conservatives and corporate America. Most notably, Mr. Trump's aggressive \u2014 and sometimes punitive \u2014 use of tariffs, which he has said will reduce the country's trade deficit, revive American manufacturing and generate federal revenue, hearkens back to the mercantilism of centuries past and contrasts with the laissez-faire ideas that have shaped the American economy.",
      "How is the U.S. paying for the Intel stake?",
      "Much of the cash for the stake is coming from the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, which is intended to boost America's competitiveness in the chip industry.",
      "Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and is on track to receive another $5.7 billion injection from the law. A different federal program gave Intel $3.2 billion, for a grand total of $11.1 billion, according to a release from Intel. Intel and the federal government say the ownership will be passive, and have not said how long the U.S. intends to hold onto its stake, although there is a provision for the government to expand its stake further.",
      "How Intel plans to use the U.S. investment",
      "The chip maker says it's planning to use the money to expand its chip-making capacity by modernizing and increasing the size of U.S. sites in Arizona and elsewhere.",
      "Hassett has defended the U.S. stake, referring to the process of partial ownership of Intel as \"very, very special circumstances\" because of the funding made available by the CHIPS Act. When he was asked about the U.S. bar for acquiring equity stakes in companies, Hassett told CNBC, \"If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.\"",
      "Strain said a government stake in U.S. companies also poses a big risk for taxpayers, too.",
      "\"This is also going to accrue to the detriment of the American people, because you're going to see a lot of good taxpayer money chasing bad investments because the government's not going to extricate itself quickly or easily from these arrangements, and more generally, countries that have gone down this route have had slower productivity growth, slower increases in living standards, and companies that are less likely to be industry leaders,\" Strain said.",
      "Past U.S. stakes in big banks and automakers",
      "One reason economists are uncomfortable with the government's stake in Intel stems from the message it may send about the U.S. economy. The most prominent modern example of a similar U.S. investment took place during the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. sunk $700 billion into a big bank bailout and over $17 billion into two of the big three U.S. automakers. It did so because the banks were considered \"too big to fail\" and the potential collapse of the auto companies could cost millions of jobs.",
      "Experts now are raising questions about the wisdom of buying a stake in a company when the economy isn't in crisis.",
      "Lincicome said the administration is sending a contradictory message by highlighting the struggles China is having with its economy while at the same time saying \"we want to be more like China\" by having the federal government more involved in U.S. companies.",
      "\"There is no crisis, there's certainly no war, so this is a big break from what we've done before,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Although economists and politicians differ on the success of the General Motors and Chrysler bailouts, Lincicome said there was undoubtedly a crisis. The federal government took ownership stakes in the two automakers to stabilize them but within a few years had sold the stakes, after the companies were on firmer financial footing.",
      "Not socialism, but maybe a step in that direction?",
      "While partial ownership of Intel or other companies isn't exactly socialism, Di Martino said it \"absolutely\" blurs the lines between the private sector and the public sector.",
      "\"Socialism and free enterprise are not a switch, they are a continuum,\" Di Martino said, adding partial ownership of U.S. companies would be \"definitely a step toward socialism, there is no doubt about that.\"",
      "Di Martino said the U.S. ownership stake in Intel \"certainly gets us closer [to socialism] and makes us less prosperous.\"",
      "\"I think the right way to describe it is a move toward state capitalism,\" Strain said. \"I don't think I would describe it as socialism.\"",
      "Lutnick put it this way: \"Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which, of course, was worth $11 billion.\"",
      "\"So, it's not socialism,\" he said at a Trump Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"This is capitalism.\"",
      "Di Martino is dubious about whether that's true. \"We are intervening in the capital markets in a way that is going to lead to inefficiencies,\" he said, adding, \"And it's going to shift capital away from other companies.\"",

    "summary": "Ford said a brake hose in two SUV models can develop a leak, potentially increasing the risk of a crash.",
    "story": [
      "Ford is recalling 500,000 vehicles over an issue that can cause two different car models to leak brake fluid, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).",
      "A hose in the cars' rear brake system can rupture and cause a leakage, recall documents state. The vehicles covered by the recall are 2016-2018 Lincoln MKX midsize luxury SUVs and 2015-2018 Edge SUVs.",
      "\"If a flexible brake hose develops a leak, the driver may experience an increase in brake pedal travel together with an increase in stopping distance,\" Ford said in a letter to car dealers. \"If the brake fluid level in the master cylinder reservoir becomes low, the red brake fluid warning indicator light will illuminate. An increase in stopping distance increases the risk of a crash.\"",
      "Ford said it will notify affected vehicle owners of the safety risk in early September. The remedy for the issue is still under development and is expected to be available in April.",
      "The recall comes after Ford this month also\u00a0recalled more than 355,000 pickup trucks over an instrument panel display failure.",
      "\"An instrument panel display that does not show critical information, such as warning lights or vehicle speed, increases the risk of a crash,\" NHTSA said in an Aug. 22 report.",
      "The notices add to a string of vehicle recalls Ford has issued this year, which Ford Chief Operating Officer Kumar Galhotra addressed in a July 16\u00a0blog post.",
      "\"The increase in recalls reflects our intensive strategy to quickly find and fix hardware and software issues and go the extra mile to help protect customers,\" he wrote. \"Ford has more than doubled its team of safety and technical experts in the past two years and significantly increased testing to failure on critical systems in current Ford vehicles such as powertrains, steering and braking. Insights from this testing are being incorporated into current production.\"",
      "Automotive expert Shaun Carse urged consumers to pay close attention to recall notices, telling CBS MoneyWatch that \"a recall notice isn't junk mail \u2014 it's basically your car writing you a doctor's note. Bin it, and you're just asking for trouble.\"",
      "\"The real test will be how fast Ford fixes this and how much confidence they can rebuild with drivers. If they play it right, they can turn a PR nightmare into a story of accountability,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "More Americans are staying put in their jobs rather than jumping ship as the\u00a0labor market cools.",
      "So concludes a new analysis from the Bank of America Institute, which drew on the deposit data from millions of its customers to track job changes and the median pay bump people get when they switch employers.",
      "The analysis shows that while the job change rate \u2014 defined in this case as the total percentage of Bank of America customers who have changed employers \u2014 has edged up this year, Americans are much less to likely switch jobs than during the \"Great Resignation.\" That was the period during the pandemic when a massive wave of workers quit their jobs, motivated by better work opportunities and work-life balance. Over 20 million people quit their jobs in the second half of 2021, according to Labor Department data.",
      "The bank's data shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downwards, from 26% since the 2022 peak, and is now just slightly above the the job change rate in 2019. The upshot: As employers have pulled back in hiring, workers are hunkering down in their current jobs.",
      "\"It's possible that, again, tariffs and just general business uncertainty is playing a role in squeezing out some of the availability for people to switch jobs, which is why that rate is declining,\" said Taylor Bowley, an economist at Bank of America Institute and lead author of the report.",
      "The labor market slowed sharply in recent months. Accounting for government data revisions, the average monthly payroll gain from May to July was only 35,000, down from average of 123,000 from January to April. The Labor Department will release the next jobs report on September 5.",
      "\"People are not leaving their jobs right now because they're nervous about the future of the labor market,\" said Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed \"It's a pretty stagnant labor market,\" she added.",
      "Lower pay hikes from switching",
      "As job hopping has waned, so too have the pay hike workers tend to get when changing jobs. The median raise for workers who switched employers was 7% in July, down from 10% in 2019 and 20% in 2022, according to the Bank of America Institute.",
      "ZipRecruiter labor economist Nicole Bachaud, citing data from the company's\u00a0New Hires Survey, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email that less than half of new hires (42%) in the second quarter negotiated their starting salary. Among those who did seek to negotiate, only 48% received higher pay.",
      "Federal Reserve data shows that for the first time since 2010, wage growth for job hoppers equaled that of job stayers in May and into July, another indication that the labor marketing is cooling.",
      "The Bank of America analysis notes the diminishing payoff from switching jobs stems in part from the shifting power dynamic between employees and employers. Workers wielded more leverage during the pandemic, when labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. However, that power is slowly shifting back toward employers as job opportunities dry up.",
      "\"This trend confirms that the labor market is no longer as tight,\" Bowley writes in the report.",
      "Uncertainty surrounding tariffs has also led employers to hold off on making major businesses investments, leading some to pause hiring altogether.",
      "\"This deceleration for both people changing jobs and then the pay rises they get when they do, could have dampening effects on consumer spending growth going forward,\" said Bowley.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-unprecedented-firing-of-fed-governor-lisa-cook-raises-untested-questions/",
    "published": "Thu, 28 Aug 2025 14:02:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Fed Governor Lisa Cook filed a lawsuit challenging what her suit said is President Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove\" her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank's Board of Governors puts the nation in uncharted legal waters, and may ultimately be up to the Supreme Court to provide clarity on whether the move crosses a legal boundary, legal scholars expect.",
      "Mr. Trump's move to oust Cook comes after months of griping about the Fed, which he says is moving too slowly to cut interest rates. But if her removal is allowed to stand \u2014 a question that will be decided by the courts \u2014 and the Senate confirms a replacement, it would mean Mr. Trump will have appointed the majority of the seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cook was named to the Fed Board by President Joe Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to serve a full 14-year term in September 2023, which is set to end in January 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was removing Cook from her post because of alleged mortgage fraud, though she has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense. The claims about Cook were made by Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who sent a\u00a0letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of\u00a0 taking out mortgages for properties in Michigan and Georgia in 2021 and claiming both would be used as her primary residence.",
      "Pulte alleged that Cook was fraudulently attempting to gain more favorable lending terms. He has also leveled allegations of mortgage fraud against California Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, two Democrats who have been among the most prominent opponents of Mr. Trump. Both have denied the accusations.",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook has set off a legal battle that could end with the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority. She filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging what the suit said is Mr. Trump's \"unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would [be] the first of its kind in the Board's history.\"",
      "\"It is clear from the circumstances surrounding Governor Cook's purported removal from the Federal Reserve Board that the mortgage allegations against her are pretextual, in order to effectuate her prompt removal and vacate a seat for President Trump to fill and forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" her complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., states.",
      "The White House has defended Mr. Trump's move to terminate Cook from the Fed Board of Governors as within his lawful authority.",
      "\"The president determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "Aggressive removals",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook is the latest in a string of removals of Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies, which have tested the bounds of his executive authority. He fired leaders of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, ousted commissioners on the Consumer Product Safety Commission and terminated officials sitting on the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.",
      "Many of the firings have led to legal challenges. The officials removed from the boards have argued Mr. Trump violated federal laws that shield them from being removed at-will. Instead, Congress has said that the only grounds for their firings are inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The laws were meant to insulate independent federal agencies and decisions from political pressure.",
      "The law establishing the Federal Reserve System, known as the Federal Reserve Act, specifies that the president can only remove a member of its Board of Governors \"for cause.\" But courts have said little about what may constitute \"cause.\" While not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, Cook argues in her lawsuit that it means instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office or comparable misconduct.",
      "The question of what qualifies as good cause, and whether Cook's alleged actions rise to it, are likely to be key questions to be answered during litigation, said Adam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on the Supreme Court.",
      "\"If [the justices] interpret good cause, they'll have to do so with an eye to the power and purpose of the Federal Reserve System more generally, the powers of the system and the purpose of its independence. What is 'good cause' with respect to the service of a Fed governor?\" he said. \"If all President Trump is going to go with is these allegations regarding the governor's mortgage application before she was on the board, I have a hard time believing that constitutes good cause because it's really not germane to the duties of the governor while she was in office.\"",
      "The Supreme Court and the Fed",
      "In a series of recent decisions, the Supreme Court has reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause.",
      "In 2020, the high court ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance \u2014 was unconstitutional.",
      "Then, in a 2021 decision striking down the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the high court acknowledged that a \"for cause\" restriction in the 2008 Recovery Act \"appears to give the president more removal authority than other removal provisions,\" like those restricting removals to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. Still, it said that \"the Constitution prohibits even 'modest restrictions' on the President's power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\"",
      "This year, in response to emergency appeals brought by ousted officials from the NLRB and the MSPB, which are multi-member bodies, the Supreme Court allowed Mr. Trump to fire those officials while their legal challenges move forward, even though Congress shielded them from being removed at will. But in a brief decision in that case that appeared to be 6-3, the Supreme Court's majority singled out the Fed.",
      "Two fired officials, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, raised concerns about the consequences of allowing their removals and whether that would call into question the constitutionality of the Fed's for-cause removal protections. The court said it disagreed. Instead, it called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",
      "Writing in dissent, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority created a \"bespoke Federal Reserve exception,\" even though its independence \"rests on the same constitutional and analytic foundations as that of the NLRB, MSPB, FTC, FCC, and so on.\"",
      "\"The court in that language does not resolve the question. All the court is saying is that the Federal Reserve is different from the FTC or from the NLRB,\" Joel Alicea, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, said. \"Yeah, it is different, but is it sufficiently different to mean that it's not subject to the same rule? The court doesn't say.\"",
      "The president's removal powers",
      "While Mr. Trump has sought to exert new levels of control over the executive branch, the Supreme Court has recognized narrow exceptions to the removal powers, allowing Congress to protect certain officials from being fired without cause.",
      "In a 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the court found that Congress can restrict the president's authority to remove multi-member commissions of experts who are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In its decision allowing the firings of the labor board members, the Supreme Court's majority said the Justice Department \"is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.\"",
      "But White said the Fed is different from those agencies because of the authority it exerts.",
      "\"Under the last 15 years of precedents, the question is what kind of powers does the agency wield and are they substantially executive?\" he said. \"And for the Fed, it does have regulatory powers and it's possible they verge on something like executive power, but the overwhelming majority of what the Fed does that is of consequence is its monetary powers. That's why the court recognized that the Fed is different.\"",
      "White continued: \"The whole reason why we're sensitive about the president's attacks on the Fed versus the NLRB is that the Fed's overwhelming purpose and its most significant power are all something very different than simple law enforcement policy. Those powers, going back to the very beginning of the country, have never been treated as executive powers.\"",
      "Alicea, however, disagreed. The Board of Governors has broad oversight and regulatory authority over the nation's banking system, he said.",
      "\"Those are core executive powers,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is suing over President Trump's attempt to fire her.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook filed suit against President Trump, Chair Jerome Powell and the Fed's Board of Governors on Thursday, asking a federal judge to block the president's attempt to fire her from the central bank.",
      "Mr. Trump announced Cook's termination from the Fed late Monday, citing allegations she had committed mortgage fraud, which he described as \"deceitful and potentially criminal.\" The move came after the president spent months railing against the Fed and Powell for leaving interest rates relatively high so far this year.",
      "Cook filed her lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Thursday, teeing up a legal showdown that seems destined to ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Her legal team asked the district court to declare that Mr. Trump's attempted firing is \"unlawful and void\" and that Cook \"remains an active member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"Governor Cook seeks immediate declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm her status as a member of the Board of Governors, safeguard her and the Board's congressionally mandated independence, and allow Governor Cook and the Federal Reserve to continue its critical work,\" the suit said.",
      "Members of the Fed board are confirmed by the Senate and serve for 14-year terms. Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the president can only remove them early \"for cause.\" The law doesn't specify what qualifies as \"cause,\" and it has never been tested in court, but it is generally understood to be malfeasance.",
      "In her suit, Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen asked the court to state that Fed board members \"can only be removed for cause, meaning instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct,\" citing Supreme Court precedent and relevant federal law. Even if the court disagrees with that standard, they wrote, the law \"clearly does not support removal for policy disagreements.\"",
      "Powell and the Fed board are named in the suit because Cook asked the court for an injunction ordering them to \"refrain from effectuating President Trump's illegal attempt to fire Governor Cook and treat Governor Cook as a member of the Board of Governors.\"",
      "In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesman Kush Desai said the president \"exercised his lawful authority\" in removing Cook.",
      "\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" Desai said in a statement. \"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the past that the president has the legal right to remove at will members of federal boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Trump's power to fire some board members, but said in May that the Federal Reserve is a separate case, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, accused Cook of falsifying mortgage documents by claiming two homes that she bought in 2021 as her primary residence. He alleged that Cook \u2014 an economist who has served on the Fed board since 2022 \u2014 had committed mortgage fraud, and referred the matter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Justice Department special attorney Ed Martin.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump publicly called on Cook to resign.",
      "At the time, Cook didn't address the substance of Pulte's allegations directly, but said in a statement that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\" She added that she would \"take any questions about my financial history seriously\" and said she was gathering more information.",
      "Lowell, her lawyer, said Monday that Mr. Trump didn't have the legal right to fire Cook \"based solely on a referral letter\" to Justice Department leadership, a point her legal team reiterated in Thursday's lawsuit.",
      "\"[R]emoval 'for cause' requires some connection to official conduct, prohibiting removal based on an unsubstantiated allegation of private misconduct (which in this case allegedly occurred prior to her Senate confirmation),\" the complaint said. \"And even to the extent that private misconduct could bear on a particular officer's official conduct in certain cases, 'cause' requires a factual basis supporting such asserted misconduct.\"",
      "The broadside against Cook came as Mr. Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank's rate-setting committee \u2014 which Cook and Powell both sit on \u2014 has opted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, fearing that inflation could resurge. Last week, Powell hinted that the central bank may cut rates soon, but it will \"proceed carefully.\"",
      "The president favors immediate rate cuts, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow money, though at the risk of causing higher inflation. He has floated firing Powell at various times over the past few months and has encouraged other Fed officials to overrule him and slash rates.",
      "The Fed typically makes interest rate decisions independently. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to criticize the Fed for leaving rates high, but he's been unusually assertive. Last year, he argued he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "Many experts believe it's important for central banks to operate independently so they can make decisions based on economic data, not politics. If elected officials are in charge of monetary policy, they could opt for the politically popular short-term benefits of low interest rates \u2014 like a hotter economy and cheaper borrowing costs \u2014 even if that leads to higher inflation in the long run, Brookings Institution senior fellow David Wessel noted earlier this year.",

The agency had initially estimated second-quarter growth at 3%.",

      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports, which are subtracted from GDP as businesses scrambled to bring in foreign goods ahead of new U.S. tariffs taking effect. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter. Imports fell at a 29.8% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",

Investors expect Federal Reserve officials to cut interest rates at their next policy meeting in September in a bid to shore up economic growth.",
      "\"While the US economy grew at an upwardly revised annualized rate of 3.3% in Q2 2025, the strength was largely a mirage, reflecting a sharp decline in imports after businesses accelerated purchases in response to tariffs in Q1,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",
      "The analysis reveals a similar pattern playing out in the following fields:",

      "Accounting and auditing",
      "Secretarial and administrative work",
      "Computer programming",
      "Sales",
      "Older employees, who generally have navigated the workplace for a longer period of time, are more likely to have picked up the kinds of communication and other \"soft\" skills that are harder to teach and that employers may be reluctant to replace with AI, the data suggests.",
      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 YouTube TV says it's reached a \"short-term extension\" in its contract dispute with Fox, meaning subscribers of the Google-owned streamer won't see immediate disruptions of Fox channels on the platform.",
      "The current carriage agreement between YouTube TV and Fox originally faced a Wednesday afternoon deadline - with YouTube previously warning that networks like Fox Sports, Business and News would become unavailable on its streaming platform if the two sides didn't reach a new deal by 5 p.m. ET.",
      "That would have left YouTube TV customers without Week 1 of some college football games and other broadcast programming from Fox. But shortly after the clock hit 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, YouTube said it was able to \"prevent disruption\" as it continues to work toward a new agreement.",
      "\"We are committed to advocating on behalf of our subscribers as we work toward a fair deal and will keep you updated on our progress,\" YouTube said in a brief update announcing the extension.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox had no addition comment, but confirmed that the broadcast giant had agreed to the short-term extension. It wasn't immediately clear how long the extension would be.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, Fox said it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" Fox also directed subscribers to a site called keepfox.com for more information and to call on YouTube to come to an agreement.",
      "In addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, keepfox.com notes that YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network (which is majority-owned by Fox) if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Meanwhile, in blog post earlier this week, YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan - which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels - costs $82.99 a month.",
      "Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also chimed in on the dispute leading up to Wednesday's deadline - while appearing to target Google particularly. He called on the tech company to \"get a deal done\" in a post on social media.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote in a Tuesday post on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want-including this week's Big Game: Texas  Ohio State.\"",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years - as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations - at times resulting in service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV has been down this road before: In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform, including networks like ESPN and local ABC stations, after a contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Beyond deals with YouTube TV and others, Fox last week launched its own streaming platform, \"Fox One,\" which has a starting price of $19.99 a month.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/car-buying-mistakes-to-avoid-edmunds-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A 2025 analysis from Edmunds reveals that nearly 20% of new car buyers are committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more.",
    "story": [
      "Buying a new car has never been more financially daunting. A 2025 analysis from Edmunds found that a record 19.3% of consumers who financed a new vehicle in the second quarter of 2025 committed to a monthly payment of $1,000 or more. That's nearly one in five buyers taking on what was once considered an extreme car payment \u2014 driven by high interest rates and rising vehicle prices.",
      "While it might be tempting to stretch your budget for the car you want, locking yourself into a high-cost loan can be a painful mistake. Before you sign, here are five common car-buying missteps to avoid.",
      "1. Buying outside your means",
      "There's a difference between being able to buy something and being able to afford it wisely. With an average new vehicle transaction price of approximately $49,000, many buyers are truly stretching their budgets. It's not uncommon to see buyers opt for extended 72-month or 84-month financing terms.",
      "That shiny SUV might seem within reach thanks to flexible financing, but the long-term hit to your financial health could be considerable. Buying within your means \u2014 ideally targeting a loan term of no more than 60 months and keeping your car-related expenses under 15%-20% of your monthly take-home pay \u2014 is smart shopping in an era of rising interest rates and ever-increasing car prices.",
      "2. Getting a dealership loan",
      "One of the most costly and common mistakes car buyers make is waiting until they're sitting in the dealership finance office to think about a loan. Dealerships may offer convenience, but their financing may include marked-up interest rates or hidden fees.",
      "Instead, walk into the dealership with a preapproved loan offer from your bank, credit union or an online lender. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, this move can save buyers hundreds to thousands of dollars over the life of the loan. When you do this, the dealer can still try to beat the rate \u2014 and sometimes will. But now you're negotiating from a position of strength, not desperation.",
      "3. Trading in a car with negative equity",
      "If you owe more on your current car than it's worth \u2014 a situation known as negative equity \u2014 trading it in for a new vehicle can be a financial landmine. This commonly happens when people take out a six-year loan, trade in the vehicle after just three or four years, and carry the previous balance into the new vehicle. Rolling that deficit into a new loan just worsens the problem, guaranteeing that you'll be underwater for even longer.",
      "According to Edmunds, 28.2% of trade-ins in July 2025 involved negative equity, and the average amount buyers owed above the vehicle's value was $6,902. That sets the stage for a vicious cycle, especially if buyers trade cars frequently or face unexpected job loss or repair costs. If you're in this situation, consider keeping your car longer or making extra payments. If you can get a better rate, even refinancing can get you back to breakeven.",
      "4. Not working with internet sales team first",
      "Most major dealerships now have dedicated internet sales teams that exist to sell you a car quickly and often at better prices than you'll get face-to-face. If you already know what make, model and trim you want, you can save hours \u2014 and hundreds or even thousands of dollars \u2014 by working with the internet sales department instead of walking onto the lot.",
      "Sites such as Edmunds can help you compare pricing between multiple dealers, and many will show you real-time inventory, rebates and incentives. This lets you shop from the comfort of home and make dealers compete for your business. It also gives you a written quote you can bring with you \u2014 a powerful tool when negotiating.",
      "5. Overlooking used car options",
      "Buying new is tempting \u2014 it smells great, it's under warranty, and no one else has touched it. But it's not always the smartest financial move. Today's certified pre-owned vehicles often come with extended factory warranties, undergo rigorous inspections, and cost thousands less than their new counterparts. The rapid depreciation of most new vehicles only worsens the picture. Most lose 20%\u201330% of their value in the first year alone, according to Edmunds. Avoiding that depreciation hit can save thousands.",
      "Buying a new car is one of the biggest financial decisions most people make \u2014 second only to purchasing a home. Avoiding these five common mistakes won't just save you money \u2014 it has the potential to help ensure your long-term financial security. Take your time and do your homework. The right deal isn't just about the car \u2014 it's about the life you want to live after you drive it off the lot.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-logo-barrel-stock-cbrl-ceo/",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Aug 2025 15:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in revamping its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant chain's value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the potential perils of tinkering with a company's branding. Following the backlash, Cracker Barrel conceded that its rebrand amounted to a misstep, saying in a statement on Monday that it \"could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Cracker Barrel decided to scrap the new logo entirely and keep the original design. \"We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\" the company\u00a0announced\u00a0on social media. \"We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.\"",
      "The decision came after President Trump on Tuesday publicly urged the company to ditch the new logo. \"Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Truth Social.",
      "Much of the initial uproar focused on the new Cracker Barrel logo doing away with the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel. The man depicts company founder Dan Evins' Uncle Herschel, whom Cracker Barrel insists will remain an integral part of its brand identity.",
      "\"Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu...on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" Cracker Barrel said.",
      "Cracker Barrel's stock price was up roughly 5% ahead of the start of trade on Wednesday, helping erase the company's earlier market loss.",
      "Tom Murphy, a branding expert and professor at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch that he thinks Cracker Barrel did the right thing in backtracking on its logo rollout.",
      "\"The decision by Cracker Barrel to return to its original logo is a positive course correction, given the intensity of emotional response from their core base of customers,\" he said. \"This gives them an opportunity to reinforce the fact that they are not moving away from their brand purpose or their heritage.\"",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts panned Cracker Barrel's attempt at overhauling its logo.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. And until the logo redesign, the figure of\u00a0Herschel\u00a0had been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The decision to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too,\" Cracker Barrel said Monday.",
      "According to a recent YouGov survey of 1,000 adults, 76% of those polled said they prefer the company's old logo to the new one.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Murphy, the Clark University branding expert, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

The study sheds light on some alternative pathways to a high-paying career that don't require a four-year degree.",
      "\"This report is pretty clear proof that you don't have to go to college to earn a really substantial income, and if you are considering a different route, there is plenty of reason to believe that in an awful lot of fields you can be every bit as successful, and every bit financially stable without that college degree,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at Lending Tree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 5.7 million, or 9%, of non-college graduates earning six-figure salaries worked in a range of fields, including software development, truck driving, elevator repair and more, according to the study. The report comes as many young people question the cost and value of a college degree, and evaluate whether the rewards are worth taking on the substantial student debt earning a degree often requires.",
      "Over the past 10 years, young workers without a bachelor's degree have seen their earnings increase, according to a 2024\u00a0study from the Pew Research Center. Amid rising tuition costs and mounting student debt, 29% of U.S. adults say the cost of college is not worth it, according to the research.",
      "The unemployment rate for young people who recently earned a college degree was close to 6% earlier this year, above the national average of 4.2%. That's in part because a growing number of employers are turning to artificial intelligence to perform tasks formerly done by entry-level workers, according to economists.",
      "Jobs than can pay $100,000 without a college degree",
      "At least 40% of workers without bachelor's degrees in 2023 earned six figures in 20 occupations, according to Lending Tree. They included software developers, sales engineers, aircraft pilots, air traffic controllers and others.",
      "Chief executives who never graduated from college were also on Lending Tree's list, with 64% earning at least six figures. To be sure, the study doesn't suggest that young workers should expect to ascend to executive-level positions without college degrees. Rather, the high share of non-college degree holders earning six figures as CEOs likely represents workers who have started their own businesses, according to Schulz.",
      "\"It speaks to the opportunity that can come from starting a small business today,\" he said. \"You're not necessarily talking about Fortune 500 companies.\"",

      "Steep U.S. tariffs on a range of Indian products took effect Wednesday, threatening a serious blow to India's overseas trade in its largest export market.",
      "President Donald Trump had initially announced a 25% tariff on Indian goods. But earlier this month he signed an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff due to India's purchases of Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its ally to 50%.",
      "The Indian government estimates the tariffs will impact $48.2 billion worth of exports. Officials have warned the new duties could make shipments to the U.S. commercially unviable, triggering job losses and slower economic growth.",
      "India\u2013U.S. trade relations have expanded in recent years but remain vulnerable to disputes over market access and domestic political pressures. India is one of the fastest-growing major global economies and it may face a slowdown as a result.",
      "Estimates by New Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative suggest labor-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewelry, leather goods, food and automobiles will be hit hardest.",
      "\"The new tariff regime is a strategic shock that threatens to wipe out India's long-established presence in the U.S., causing unemployment in export-driven hubs and weakening its role in the industrial value chain,\" said Ajay Srivastava, the think tank's founder and a former Indian trade official.",

      "Puran Dawar, a leather footwear exporter in northern India's Agra city, says the industry would take a substantial hit in the near term unless domestic demand strengthens and other overseas markets buy more Indian goods.",
      "\"This is an absolute shock,\" said Dawar, whose business with the U.S. has grown in recent years. Dawar's clients include the major fashion retailer Zara.",
      "Dawar, who is also the regional chairman of the Council for Leather Exports \u2014 an export promotion body \u2014 said the U.S. should understand that the steep tariffs will hurt its own consumers.",
      "Groups representing exporters warn that new import tariffs could hurt India's small and medium enterprises that are heavily reliant on the American market.",
      "\"It's a tricky situation. Some product lines will simply become unviable overnight,\" said Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations.",
      "The tariffs come as the U.S. administration continues to push for greater access to India's agriculture and dairy sectors.",
      "India and the U.S. have held five rounds of negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement, but have yet to reach a deal.

    "summary": "The wealthiest 400 people in the U.S. pay a tax rate of 24%, lower than the average rate for all other taxpayers, economists find.",
    "story": [
      "The rich are different from other people \u2014 and that also applies to the share of their income they pay in taxes, according to a new study from University of California, Berkeley, economists.",
      "The individuals who make up the\u00a0Forbes 400 list, topped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk with a fortune of $244 billion, paid an average effective tax rate of 24% from 2018 to 2020, compared with a 30% rate for all other U.S. taxpayers, the researchers said in a new paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The research comes as President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law on July 4, delivers its largest\u00a0benefits to the highest-earning Americans\u00a0through a mix of new and extended tax breaks. Those include raising the estate-tax exemption to $15 million per person, up from about $14 million.",
      "The changes build on an earlier tax cut \u2014 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr. Trump's signature first-term legislation. That 2017 law reduced the effective tax rate for the richest Americans from 30% to 24%, the researchers found.",
      "The new findings \u2014 from Berkeley economists and noted inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u2014 calculates the tax rate by tallying all income taxes, as well as corporate taxes that are paid by the companies owned by the richest Americans. In other words, it assigns a share of Amazon's corporate taxes to that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos when calculating his total tax burden.",
      "\"The economic income of the wealthiest are essentially the profits of the businesses they own,\" Saez told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Jeff Bezos owns about 10% of Amazon, and hence his true economic income is 10% of Amazon's profits.\"",
      "Corporate taxes are levies on the profits generated for Bezos, similar to how an employer withholds federal income and Social Security contributions from a worker's paycheck, he added.",
      "Saez and Zucman are leading proponents of instituting a U.S. wealth tax to help address widening inequality between the haves and have-nots. That idea has been embraced by some lawmakers, such as Senators Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont.",
      "Some conservative critics have argued that wealth taxes could be self-defeating, with the Hoover Institute noting in a 2023 blog post that the levy could discourage entrepreneurship and investment.",
      "Research shows that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while cutting taxes for many individuals and businesses, hasn't had a significant impact on the economy, the Congressional Research Service found in an April report. Republican proponents of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" such as House Speaker Mike Johnson, also\u00a0say\u00a0that it will boost the economy and provide tax relief to workers and families.",
      "How billionaires pay a smaller share",
      "U.S. income taxes are designed to be progressive, meaning that higher-earning workers pay a bigger share of their income to the IRS than people lower down the ladder. But because capital gains \u2014 the profits earned from selling stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets \u2014and business income are taxed at a lower rate than the top rate for income that people earn through their jobs, the richest Americans reap a massive tax break.",
      "For instance, the highest tax rate on earned income stands at 37%, which is assessed on every dollar earned above $609,351 for individual taxpayers. Yet that same person will pay only a 20% tax rate on long-term capital gains, such as profits from a stock sale, and a 21% corporate tax rate on income earned through a partnership or other business.",
      "And if the rich don't sell their shares, they don't have to pay any taxes on that wealth because they haven't realized a capital gain, Saez noted.",
      "\"The individual income tax is designed to be progressive thanks to its increasing tax rates by brackets, and it does a pretty good job except among the billionaire class,\" he said. \"As I said, the billionaire class can avoid realizing individual income and hence can escape the individual income tax.\"",
      "To be sure, the rich are shouldering the largest share of the nation's taxes, IRS data also shows. The top 1% of earners \u2013 people who make over roughly $663,000 per year \u2014 account for roughly 40% of all federal individual income tax, while the top 50% contribute 97%, a Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis\u00a0of IRS data shows. The bottom half of income earners account for about 3% of those taxes.",
      "Some wealthy Americans pay a tax rate exceeding the 30% average, the new paper also found. The top labor earners \u2014 people who depend on high wages for their incomes rather than capital gains or corporate profits \u2014 have a 45% effective tax rate, according to Berkeley analysis.",
      "The findings about the richest 400 Americans suggest that a wealth tax is still needed to curb inequality in the U.S., Saez said.",
      "\"The wealth tax is the most direct and powerful way to specifically target the ultra-rich and increase tax progressivity at the very top,\" he said. \"The wealth tax on the ultra-rich is also popular but will obviously be fought by billionaires, and they have disproportionate influence.\"",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court said many of the tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, but didn't halt them.",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.",
      "The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.",
      "The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.",
      "The court's\u00a0ruling\u00a0will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.",
      "Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court \"Highly Partisan\" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.",
      "\"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said \"undermines the United States on the world stage\" and is \"interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.\"",
      "Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.",
      "The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs \"a core Congressional power,\" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.",
      "While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.",
      "Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates \u2014 but still left them with higher duties than before \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.",
      "But critics \u2014 and many economists \u2014 warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's \"Liberation Day\" dive.",
      "Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the \"major questions doctrine,\" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.",

      "While it will almost certainly be appealed, Friday's order is a major setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, including its campaign to arrest asylum-seekers at immigration courthouses across the U.S. \u2014 an operation that has relied on the expansion of expedited removal.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb paused a January directive that had expanded the expedited removal policy \u2014 long limited to border areas and recent arrivals \u2014 to anywhere in the country and to those who arrived in the past two years.",
      "Expedited removal allows federal immigration officials to quickly deport certain migrants, without allowing them to see an immigration judge, unless they claim asylum and pass an interview with a U.S. asylum officer. Before President Trump took office for a second time, the fast-track deportations only applied to unauthorized migrants apprehended within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Cobb said the pro-immigrant advocates who challenged the legality of the nationwide expansion of expedited removal had made a \"strong showing\" that the effort \"violates the due process rights of those it affects.\"",
      "\"In so holding, the Court does not cast doubt on the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute, nor on its longstanding application at the border,\" Cobb wrote in her opinion. \"It merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process. The procedures currently in place fall short.\"",

Two labor unions and an advocacy group had filed a complaint claiming that allowing the access would violate the Privacy Act and a federal law. A lower court agreed with the plaintiffs and issued an injunction, and an appellate court also declined to lift the stay. Solicitor General D. John Sauer then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the injunction was forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",

    "story": [
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CBS News the Trump administration has not communicated with his state on a reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, calling the idea an \"invasion\" and arguing President Trump has \"other aims\" aside from cracking down on crime.",
      "Asked about a possible military deployment to America's third-largest city, which was recently reported by The Washington Post, Pritzker told CBS News: \"It's clear that, in secret, they're planning this \u2014 well, it's an invasion with U.S. troops, if they, in fact, do that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has deployed National Guard forces and federal agents to the streets of two other major cities \u2014 Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. \u2014 in recent months, part of what the president casts as a crackdown against illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.",
      "Last week, the president said his administration could take similar steps in Chicago. Mr. Trump called the city a \"mess\" and lashed out against Mayor Brandon Johnson, saying, \"We'll straighten that one out probably next.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is planning major immigration enforcement operations in Chicago that could start as soon as next week, echoing a similar operation in Los Angeles, sources told CBS News. And The Washington Post has reported that the Pentagon is drawing up plans to potentially send thousands of National Guard members to the Midwest's largest metro area as early as September \u2014 though those plans haven't been publicly confirmed.",
      "Pritzker told CBS News that, if Mr. Trump sends the Guard to Chicago, voters \"should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime.\"",
      "The governor argued that the president's gambit may be part of a plan to \"stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.\"",
      "He also called the idea \"an attack on the American people.\"",
      "\"Now, he may disagree with a state that didn't vote for him. But, should he be sending troops in? No,\" Pritzker said in an interview with CBS News in Chicago.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson rejected Pritzker's accusations and blasted the city's violent crime rate.",
      "\"It's amazing the lengths this slob will go to in order to deflect from the terrible crime crisis that has been plaguing Chicago for years,\" Jackson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Chicago's residents would be much safer if Pritzker actually did his job and addressed his crime problem instead of trying to be a Resistance Lib hero.\"",
      "The Guard deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. have drawn stiff pushback from elected officials who argue local police are better able to handle crime, and warn the presence of federal agents and military personnel could inflame tensions.",
      "Future military deployments could also draw legal challenges. While Mr. Trump controls the D.C. National Guard outright, the governors of the 50 states typically control their own Guard forces except in certain circumstances.",
      "The Trump administration deployed thousands of California National Guard members to Los Angeles over Gov. Gavin Newsom's objections in June, arguing they were necessary to protect federal immigration agents and facilities from tense protests in the city.",
      "The state of California sued the administration, calling the deployment illegal. An appeals court found that Mr. Trump likely did have the legal authority to call up the state's National Guard, under a law that lets the president call Guard forces into federal service during a \"rebellion\" or if he isn't able to \"execute the laws of the United States.\" A lower court is still reviewing whether military forces in Los Angeles were inappropriately used for law enforcement purposes.",

He's part of the team covering President Trump and covered all four years of Joe Biden's presidency.

    "summary": "Veterans forced out under the mandate have been frustrated by what they described as a slow, arduous process to return to service.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon is considering speeding up the process to bring back ex-service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Less than two dozen service members have been reinstated, though hundreds have applied.",
      "Sources say Defense Department officials are weighing whether to grant honorable discharges to some people forced out of the U.S. military for not getting vaccinated.",
      "The change would apply only to those whose departures stemmed exclusively from their refusal to take the vaccine. Troops who refused the shots but also had additional disciplinary infractions would not be eligible to have their discharges upgraded.",
      "Veterans forced out under the mandate have been frustrated by what they described as a slow, arduous process to return to service. Some have also called for accountability for military leaders who enforced the Biden-era vaccine policy and would like to see them terminated from their positions.",
      "A listening session regarding snags in the reinstatement process is scheduled for Sept. 3. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is likely to speak, two of the sources said.",
      "Then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in 2021 mandated the coronavirus vaccine for all service members, citing the need for a \"healthy and ready force.\"",
      "It was a polarizing issue among the rank and file and in the highest corridors of the Pentagon.",
      "Congress limited the type of discharges defense officials could issue for refusing the coronavirus vaccine. The lawmakers required service members receive either an honorable discharge, or what's known as a \"general discharge under honorable conditions\" \u2013 a status that signals a service member fell short of meeting every standard of conduct, but generally served in good faith.",
      "Republicans lawmakers successfully sought an end to the coronavirus vaccine mandate and Austin rescinded it in 2023.",
      "By then, roughly 8,700 active duty and reserve service members had either voluntarily or involuntarily left the military for refusing to take the vaccine.",
      "A week after taking office, President Trump signed an executive order reinstating those who requested it, and called the vaccine mandate \"an unfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden on our service members.\"",
      "Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell told CBS News on Friday that the Defense Department is prioritizing reinstatement cases and will continue to seek feedback from those men and women.",
      "Officials recently enabled military branches to offer service members additional incentives to fulfill their four-year service obligation entirely in an active reserve status, with eligibility for back pay, Parnell said. Or, service members can choose to serve two years on active duty and two years in an active reserve status.",
      "\"The military services can also offer other incentives, such as duty station preferences, appropriate reclassification, and geographic stability during initial assignments,\" Parnell said.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said Friday that he is calling Missouri lawmakers into a special session to redraw the state's U.S. House districts as part of a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking an edge in next year's congressional elections.",
      "Kehoe made the announcement just hours after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. It marked a win for President Trump, who has been urging Republican-led states to reshape district lines to give the party a better shot at retaining control of the House.",
      "Missouri is the third state to pursue an unusual mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican-led Texas took up the task first but was quickly countered by Democratic-led California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more seats.",
      "Kehoe scheduled Missouri's special session to begin Sept. 3. He released a proposed new map that targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas.",
      "His agenda also includes another Republican priority \u2014 a proposed constitutional amendment that would make it harder to approve citizen-initiated ballot measures, such as abortion rights and marijuana legalization amendments adopted in recent years.",
      "Kehoe cast both items as a defense against liberal politicians and activists.",
      "\"Missouri's conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Missouri's treasurer\u00a0and lieutenant governor, both Republicans, have also said previously that they favor a new map.",
      "\"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them,\" Lt. Gov. David Wasinger said in a statement in July.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump praised the move, saying it \"will give the incredible people of Missouri the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "Democrats were quick to express outrage. Missouri state House Minority Leader Ashley Aune called Kehoe a \"Trump puppet\" attempting to \"steal a congressional seat for Republicans\" and gut the ballot initiative process.",
      "It \"marks the worst threat to the integrity of our state government since pro-slavery lawmakers voted for Missouri to join the Confederacy in 1861,\" Aune said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is represented in the U.S. House by six Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 Cleaver and Rep. Wesley Bell in St. Louis.",
      "Cleaver called the proposed redistricting an attack on democracy perpetrated by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation,\" Cleaver said in a statement while vowing not to concede the seat.",
      "Missouri Democrats have little ability to prevent Republican lawmakers from enacting a new map. Unlike in Texas, where Democrats left the state for two weeks to delay a vote, Missouri Democrats' absence would not prevent a quorum for business. And although Democrats could filibuster in the Senate, Republicans could use procedural maneuvers to shut that down, as they did earlier this year to pass a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortion.",
      "Republicans won a 220-215 House majority over Democrats in 2024. Democrats would need to net three seats in next year's election to take control of the chamber.",
      "Some Missouri Republicans had pushed for a map that could give them a 7-1 edge when redrawing districts after the 2020 census. But the GOP legislative majority ultimately opted against it. Some feared the more aggressive plan could be susceptible to a legal challenge and could backfire in a poor election year for Republicans by creating more competitive districts that could allow Democrats to win three seats.",
      "Republican officials in Florida, Indiana and elsewhere also are considering revising their U.S. House districts, as are Democratic officials in Illinois, Maryland and New York.",
      "In Utah, a judge recently ordered the Republican-led Legislature to draw new congressional districts after finding that lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Republicans have won all four of Utah's congressional seats under the map approved by lawmakers in 2021.",

      "Federal prosecutors in D.C. filed criminal charges against a man who burned an American flag outside of the White House earlier this week, after President Trump signed an executive order ordering the Justice Department to investigate flag burning.",
      "Jan Carey, 54, of North Carolina, is facing two misdemeanor criminal counts in Washington, D.C., federal court. Neither charge focuses on the fact that he burned a flag, specifically: one of the counts was for lighting a fire \"not in a designated area and receptacle,\" and another was for lighting a fire \"in a manner that threatened, caused damage to, and resulted in the burning of property, real property, and park resources.\"",
      "Both charges are punishable by a fine or no more than six months in custody.",
      "In a video of the flag burning captured by WUSA9\u00a0on Monday, Carey identified himself as a military veteran and said he was protesting the executive order.",
      "In an interview with WUSA9, Carey said he \"immediately thought I need to go burn a flag in front of the White House and let's put this to the test.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to investigate people who burn the American flag, even though the Supreme Court in 1989 ruled that the First Amendment protected symbolic speech, including flag burning.",
      "Mr. Trump's order attempts to navigate around the Supreme Court ruling. It said federal prosecutors should prioritize bringing cases against instances of flag burning that violate other \"content-neutral laws,\" and said the high court didn't rule out charges if burning a flag \"is likely to incite imminent lawless action\" or amounts to \"fighting words.\"",
      "The president has long pushed for criminal prosecutions for burning an American flag, suggesting in 2016 that it should be punished by \"loss of citizenship or year in jail.\"",
      "\"You burn a flag, you get one year in jail. You don't get 10 years, you don't get one month,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"You get one year in jail, and it goes on your record, and you will see flag burning stopping immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's order also calls for Attorney General Pam Bondi to litigate a challenge to the 1989 ruling, potentially getting the issue in front of a Supreme Court bench that is far more conservative than the high court was at the time of the original decision. And it suggests alleged flag burners could be charged with inciting a riot.",
      "Carey, however, was not charged with incitement.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Carey for comment.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

      "Over a third of the Senate's seats are up for election in 2026 \u2014 Democrats will be defending 13 seats, while Republicans will be trying to hold onto 24. But the map offers few opportunities for Democrats to flip seats, with many of the Republicans seeking reelection hailing from states that President Trump comfortably won in 2024. Meanwhile, the retirement of three Senate Democrats up for reelection in 2026 has created possible openings for the GOP.",
      "With 53 Republicans in the upper chamber, Democrats would need to defend seats in some competitive states, while flipping four seats in order to secure a majority.",
      "The key races likely to determine who controls the Senate after 2026 are beginning to take shape, with contentious primary challenges in some states and newcomers to watch in a handful of open seats in the upper chamber.",

      "North Carolina",
      "North Carolina was already expected to be competitive in 2026, even before GOP Sen. Thom Tillis announced in June he wouldn't seek reelection. The open seat in the Tar Heel State has emerged as a key prize as Democrats look to make gains in the Senate.",
      "President Trump won the state by more than three points in 2024, and North Carolina has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race \u2014 with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008 \u2014 which also marked the last time the state sent a Democrat to the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to flip the Senate seat in 2026, with their dream recruit, former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper.",
      "Cooper, who announced his Senate bid in July, is a two-term governor and the longest-serving state attorney general in North Carolina's history.",
      "The contest heated up days after Cooper entered the race, when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley announced a bid for the open seat, teeing up what's expected to be among the most expensive races of the cycle. Whatley has never run for office but played a key role in Mr. Trump's reelection effort. He's leaning on his conservative acumen and an endorsement from the president, as well as the connections he's forged as RNC chair.",

      "Georgia",
      "Widely viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat this election cycle, Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking a second term in the Senate after he eked out a win in the 2020 elections when the Georgia race went to a runoff.",
      "Ossoff's narrow victory secured a Democratic majority in the Senate, at the same time Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia in a presidential election since 1992. But Georgia flipped again in 2024, supporting Mr. Trump, making Ossoff the only incumbent Democrat this cycle defending a seat the president won in the last election.",
      "With a number of Republicans already jockeying to take on Ossoff, the GOP primary threatens to be a bruising one for the party. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley have all entered the race. And though Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp opted not to launch a bid, Dooley is widely seen as his pick. Meanwhile, the president, who has publicly clashed with Kemp in recent years, has yet to endorse a candidate.",
      "New Hampshire",

      "Though Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion since 2017, a Republican hasn't carried New Hampshire in a presidential election since 2000, and the state last elected a Republican to the Senate in 2010. Still, Republicans have put up a number of formidable challenges in the state in recent years, and the GOP is aiming to capitalize on the open seat this cycle.",
      "On the Republican side, former Sen. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts from 2010 to 2013, launched a bid to represent New Hampshire in the Senate after falling short against Shaheen in 2014. State Sen. Dan Innis, who launched two unsuccessful House bids, is also running. Former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a bid earlier this year, despite having the president's support.",
      "Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, who's represented New Hampshire in the House since 2019, announced a bid for Shaheen's seat in April and quickly earned her endorsement. In early August, Karishma Manzur, a medical scientist, became the first Democrat to challenge Pappas in the primary.",

Gary Peters' surprise\u00a0announcement\u00a0in January that he wouldn't seek reelection in 2026 opened up a key seat in the battleground state, which has flipped in the presidential races between President Trump in 2016 to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and back to Mr. Trump in 2024.",
      "Without the advantage traditionally provided by an incumbent, Democrats are drawing from a wide talent pool, with a crowded primary already underway. Though Biden administration Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg considered entering the race, he ultimately passed on a bid earlier this year. Among the Democrats who have entered the race so far are Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and former Michigan health official Abdul El-Sayed. In Michigan, which has the largest concentration of Arabs in the U.S., Israel's war in Gaza is expected to become a key issue in the primary.",
      "On the GOP side, former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers also launched a bid earlier this year, after falling short in his race against Sen. Elissa Slotkin last year. Mr. Trump\u00a0endorsed\u00a0the Army veteran last month, saying that from \"the U.S. Army to Congress, Mike has served our Nation with distinction, and will bring that same Fighting Spirit to the U.S. Senate.\"",

And although Cornyn has worked to mend the relationship with Mr. Trump, becoming a vocal supporter of the president's second term agenda, the dynamic has made for a messy primary fight so far \u2014 and added to speculation about his eventual endorsement. Asked this week about an endorsement in the race, Mr. Trump remained undecided, telling reporters, \"I'll make up my mind, I like them both.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Texas attorney general, who was reelected to a third term as the state's top prosecutor in 2022, has faced a series of controversies in recent years, with an impeachment and criminal securities fraud charges that were later dismissed. In July, his wife announced that she had filed for divorce on \"biblical grounds.\"",

Brown lost to Moreno by less than four points.

      "Among Democrats, leading candidates Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Rep. Angie Craig are facing off. And a dominant candidate has yet to materialize in the crowded GOP field, which includes former NBA player Royce White, who fell short in his 2024 bid against Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Adam Schwarze, a retired NAVY Seal, also launched a bid for the open seat earlier this year.",
      "Iowa",

      "Ernst, a 55-year-old who was elected to the Senate in 2014, faced criticism from Democrats over\u00a0comments\u00a0she made about Medicaid cuts, and she was hammered by the GOP base over her initial reluctance to support Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation.",
      "But a Democrat would face steep odds in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 13 points in 2024. The Hawkeye State hasn't sent a Democrat to the Senate since 2008.",
      "The Democratic field is crowded, with state Rep. Josh Turek, state Sen. Zach Wahls and Nathan Sage, executive director of the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce, vying for the nomination. State Rep. J.D. Scholten had also launched a campaign, but he bowed out earlier this month and endorsed Turek.",

      "The election Tuesday was the town's first since at least the 1960s, held under a federal settlement. Black residents had sued, challenging what they called the town's \"hand-me-down governance\" and refusal to let Braxton serve after he ran unopposed for mayor in 2020.",
      "Newbern's residents number just 133 people. A library, the town hall, a mercantile and a flashing caution light anchor the downtown, about 40 miles west of Selma.",
      "What the town had been without is elections.",
      "Newbern's mayor-council government had not been put to a vote for six decades. Instead, town officials held \"hand-me-down\" positions, with each mayor appointing a successor who appointed the council members, according to the lawsuit filed by Braxton and others and reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The result was an overwhelmingly White government in a town where Black residents outnumber White residents 2-1. Only one Black person ever served on the town council.",
      "Braxton, a volunteer firefighter, qualified in 2020 to run for the nonpartisan position of mayor. He said that he ran because he had \"concerns that the Town Council and Mayor were not responding to the needs of the majority Black community\" in Newbern. In his lawsuit, he alleged that the previous mayor gave him the wrong information about how to run for the office.",
      "Braxton was the only candidate for mayor in 2020, becoming mayor-elect without an election. He alleged that previous town leaders did not provide public notice about the election. He then appointed a new town council, as other mayors have done. Braxton asked both Black and White residents to serve, but no White residents agreed to join his council, according to the lawsuit.",
      "But the locks were changed at the town hall multiple times, and Braxton was denied access to the town's financial accounts. His lawsuit also alleged that outgoing council members held a secret meeting to set up a special election and \"fraudulently reappointed themselves as the town council.\"",
      "\"I didn't get a chance to serve but one year out of the five years,\" said Braxton, who finally occupied the office last year after a three-year legal battle.",
      "Town officials had denied wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that Braxton's claim to be mayor was \"invalid.\"",
      "The settlement agreement included a promise to hold a mayoral election in 2025.",
      "Braxton had one challenger this time \u2014 a White auctioneer and Realtor, Laird Cole.",
      "\"Mayor Braxton's election represents a turning point for Newbern, restoring democratic governance, ensuring fair representation, and reaffirming that every resident has a voice in their local government,\" Madison Hollon, program manager of political campaigns for the SPLC Action Fund, said Thursday. The group endorsed Braxton in the race.",
      "The mayor said his lopsided victory should eliminate any \"doubts people had hanging in their heads on if people want me.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-trump-attempt-remove-lisa-cook-federal-governor/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 13:28:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced earlier this week that he would be removing Lisa Cook as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
      "The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.",
      "Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.",
      "Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises \"important questions that may be of first impression\" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the \"unique functions\" of the central bank and the importance \"of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.\"",
      "Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors \"for cause.\"",
      "In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have \"erred\" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, \"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.",
      "\"This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice\" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that \"cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.\"",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the \"for cause\" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws \u2014 inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office \u2014\u00a0 into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to \"cause.\" She also asked Lowell to provide the \"best authority\" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.",
      "Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.",
      "Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that \"making facially contradictory statements in financial documents \u2014 whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not \u2014 is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.\"",
      "They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes \"cause,\" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.",
      "\"Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve \u2014 a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes \"cause,\" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was \"uncomfortable\" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to \"go dig in\" and find reasons to remove sitting members.",
      "\"What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?\" she asked Roth. \"That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?\"",
      "Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.",
      "Cobb, though, also said she had a \"strong reaction\" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.",
      "As to the timing of the alleged misconduct \u2014 Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board \u2014 Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, \"it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.\"",
      "Roth said \"cause\" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.",
      "Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.",
      "Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.",
      "The Supreme Court called the central bank a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the 18th- and 19th-century central bank predecessors of the Fed.",

      "A federal appeals court on Friday blocked the Trump administration's plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have had permission to live and work in the United States.",
      "A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in California upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status, or TPS, for Venezuelans while the case proceeded through court.",
      "An email to the Department of Homeland Security for comment was not immediately returned.",
      "The 9th Circuit panel found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the department had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior TPS extension because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit for it.",
      "\"In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,\" the court wrote.",
      "U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration overstepped its authority in terminating the protections and were motivated by racial animus in doing so. Chen ordered a freeze on the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.",
      "It is unclear what effect Friday's ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. Protections for another group of 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire Sept. 10.",
      "Congress authorized temporary protected status as part of the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other \"extraordinary and temporary conditions\" that prevent a safe return to that home country.",
      "In ending the protections, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow migrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.",
      "Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is looking to claw back nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funds that Congress already approved, deploying a rarely used maneuver known as a pocket rescission to withhold funding without lawmakers' authorization.",
      "The move has prompted bipartisan pushback from Capitol Hill, with one top Republican calling it \"unlawful.\"",
      "In a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson posted on X by the White House Office of Management and Budget, the president said he was proposing \"15 rescissions of budget authority, totaling $4.9 billion.\" The cuts include funding for the State Department as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development and international development and assistance programs.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously tried to nix foreign aid Congress has already approved, and lawmakers voted to go along with the cuts in July. But Mr. Trump's pocket rescission is an attempt to rescind funding unilaterally. OMB insists this move is within the president's power.",
      "\"For the first time in nearly 50 years, the president is using his authority under the Impoundment Control Act to deploy a pocket rescission, cancelling $4.9 billion in woke and weaponized foreign aid money that violates the president's America first priorities,\" an OMB spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "Under the Impoundment Control Act, the president can propose rescissions of budget authority, which Congress has 45 legislative days to approve. But if proposals are made late in the fiscal year, the funds can effectively be withheld until they expire. The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. The last pocket rescission occurred in 1977, according to the Government Accountability Office, Congress's nonpartisan watchdog agency.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine and chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, immediately pushed back against the president's plan to not spend money that lawmakers approved.",
      "\"Given that this package was sent to Congress very close to the end of the fiscal year when the funds are scheduled to expire, this is an apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval,\" Collins said in a statement, adding that the GAO \"has concluded that this type of rescission is unlawful and not permitted by the Impoundment Control Act.\"",
      "\"Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse,\" she said. \"Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.\"",
      "In a decision in 2018, the GAO concluded that the Impoundment Control Act \"does not permit the impoundment of funds through their date of expiration.\" An OMB official pointed to a\u00a0GAO decision from 1975 that found funding in a proposed rescission lapsed at the end of the fiscal year under the ICA, noting that GAO had proposed changes to the law that Congress has not adopted.",
      "Mr. Trump's pocket rescission appears to raise the chances of a government shutdown at the end of September, when funding for federal agencies expires. Sixty votes are needed in the Senate to approve spending bills, meaning Republicans will need the votes of at least seven Democrats to avoid a shutdown.",
      "The administration reneging on previously passed spending threatens to erode Democrats' confidence that any deal they reach with Republicans would be honored by the White House. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York hinted at that dynamic in a statement, saying the president and his Republican allies are \"hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and 'going it alone' this fall.\"",
      "\"Reasonable Republicans don't have to go along with the madness; Republicans don't have to be a rubber stamp for this carnage. Democrats stand ready to work with anyone to help American families, lower health care costs and secure our communities,\" Schumer said. \"But if Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won't be party to their destruction.\"",

      "President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0suspending what's known as the\u00a0de minimis exemption\u00a0late last month.",
      "At the time, the White House said that would close what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S.",
      "The exemption applied to parcels valued at $800 or less and let overseas retailers ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "Mr. Trump \"is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "The president \"ending of the deadly de minimum loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters Thursday, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "But there will still be a six-month transition period when postal service shippers can choose to pay a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package depending on the country of origin, Reuters said, citing Trump administration officials.",
      "Mr. Trump ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong in May. It had allowed retailers such as Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S., according to the White House.",
      "The exemption's end now applies to all nations.",
      "The de minimis provision was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after the law passed. It was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has surged over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to nearly 1.4 billion. Customs and Border Patrol was processing more than 4 million de minimis shipments to the U.S. daily, the White House said.",
      "Retailers such as Shein and Temu were forced to scramble when the loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong was suspended China-based Temu halted shipments of Chinese goods to American customers and shifted to only selling products to U.S. shoppers that could be sourced from the company's U.S. warehouses.",

    "story": [
      "Seattle \u2014 Two firefighters who were part of a 44-person crew fighting a wildland blaze on Washington state's Olympic Peninsula were arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents during a multiagency criminal investigation into the two contractors they worked for, federal authorities said Thursday.",
      "The arrests prompted Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington State, to call U.S. immigration policy \"sick.\"",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Land Management asked the Border Patrol to help check the workers' identities Wednesday when crews were working in a remote area, the Border Patrol said in a statement. Border Patrol agents found two workers who were in the U.S. illegally and arrested them, the ageny said.",
      "Federal authorities didn't provide information about the investigation into the contractors and didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about the criminal case.",
      "The BLM terminated the contracts with Table Rock Forestry Inc. and ASI Arden Solutions Inc. \u2014 both from Oregon \u2014 and escorted the remaining 42 workers off federal land, the release said. The two arrested were taken to the Bellingham station on charges of illegal entry and reentry, the release added.",
      "Email and phone messages left Thursday for the two businesses seeking comment weren't immediately returned.",
      "Initial reports saying firefighters had been arrested by federal agents sparked the outrage from Murray. Several firefighters who witnessed the incident had told The Seattle Times anonymously that federal agents had taken two firefighters into custody.",
      "Murray responded to the news Thursday by saying the Trump administration has undercut wildland firefighting by \"decimating the Forest Service\" and their immigration policy \"is fundamentally sick.\"",
      "\"Here in the Pacific Northwest, wildfires can, and have, burned entire towns to the ground,\" she said in a statement. \"This new Republican policy to detain firefighters on the job is as immoral as it is dangerous.\"",
      "She added that she is \"demanding immediate answers from this administration about the circumstances of this incident, the whereabouts of the detained firefighters, and the administration's current policy regarding immigration enforcement during active wildfires.\"",
      "Dennis Lawson, president of the Washington State Council of Fire Fighters, told The Associated Press firefighters work as a team and losing a member for any reason hurts their ability to serve their communities.",
      "The Border Patrol asserted that, \"The contract termination and enforcement action did not interfere with firefighting operations or the response to any active fires in the area, nor did it pose any danger to the surrounding community.\"",
      "U.S. Border Patrol Blaine Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rosario Vasquez said in the statement that the effort highlights the coordination among federal agencies to ensure the integrity of government operations.",
      "\"U.S. Border Patrol steadfastly enforces the laws of the United States and unapologetically addresses violations of immigration law wherever they are encountered,\" Vasquez said.",
      "The crews were helping with the Bear Gulch Fire, which has burned about 14 square miles on the north side of Lake Cushman in the Olympic National Forest and National Park. It was 13% contained by Thursday afternoon.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, of Oregon, said in a post on X that one of the firefighters arrested was from his state and denounced the arrest, saying it makes communities less safe. The man is represented by lawyers with the nonprofit Innovation Law Lab, who said he was unlawfully detained and they haven't been able to locate him.",
      "\"We demand that they allow him to access counsel as is his right afforded by the U.S. Constitution,\" lawyer Rodrigo Fernandez-Ortega said in an email. \"We have seen entire towns burned to the ground and it is outrageous that the U.S. border patrol unlawfully detained the brave individuals who are protecting us.\"",
      "Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the news, adding that firefighters help keep communities safe. He said his team has reached out to the federal agencies to get more information and \"to question why the Trump administration's cruel immigration policies now extend to individuals fighting forest fires.\"",
      "Jennifer Risdal, a spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service's Incident Management Team overseeing the firefighting efforts, said they were aware of the Border Patrol activities at the fire site, but offered no information about what happened.",
      "During the first Trump administration, DHS issued a statement in the course of the 2020 wildfire season saying CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement were concerned about the impact the fires could have on Western states and that their highest priority was \"the preservation of life and safety.\"",
      "\"In consideration of these circumstances, there will be no immigration enforcement initiatives associated with evacuations or sheltering related to the wildfires, except in the event of a serious public safety threat,\" the statement said.",
      "Commissioner of Public Lands Dave Upthegrove, whose agency oversees Washington's wildland firefighting efforts, said he was aware of the enforcement actions at the Bear Gulch Fire.",
      "\"While we don't have all of the details yet, this is all occurring at a time when the Trump administration's crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public \u2014 including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our state,\" he said.",

      "China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for reaction to the language used by Wicker to describe Taiwan.",
      "Before Wicker spoke in Taipei, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun called the U.S. delegation's visit \"a serious violation\" of the one-China principle, a U.S. policy adopted decades ago that recognizes Taiwan as part of China.",

      "\"It is our determination and our intention that Taiwan remain free and make its own decisions,\" Wicker said after their talks with Lai. \"Part of maintaining the freedoms that we have is enhanced cooperation militarily, enhanced cooperation with our defense industrial base, making the best use of those funds.\"",

      "While the U.S. stopped recognizing Taiwan as an independent state in the late 1970s, in favor of China, Washington has remained Taipei's most important backer and biggest supplier of arms that it would need to defend itself from any theoretical attack by China.",
      "That support has become increasingly crucial to Taiwan in recent years, as China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring the island under Beijing's control. China has increased military pressure with large-scale exercises and routine flights and naval excursions that test the democratic island's air and sea boundaries.",
      "Ahead of the meeting with Wicker and Fischer, Lai said he hoped Taiwan and the U.S. would further \"enhance cooperation,\" and insisted the island and China were \"not subordinate\" to each other.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-intel-stake-consertatives-economists-response/",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Aug 2025 06:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Critics caution U.S. government equity stakes in American companies could lead to cronyism, distorted economics and bad deals for taxpayers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration's 10% stake in Intel, announced not long after President Trump had called on the chip maker's CEO to resign, is being criticized by conservatives and some economic policy experts alike, who worry such extensive government intervention undermines free enterprise.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, may have fueled those misgivings, telling CNBC this week that although Intel is a \"very, very special\" circumstance, that \"there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry, then other industries.\" The possibility of the U.S. acquiring stakes in additional U.S. companies was immediately met with criticism.",
      "Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Foundation for International Economics, responded immediately to Hassett's comment, posting on X, \"ARE you effing kidding me? We are going past 1984 into Animal Farm territory at this point,\" referring to the George Orwell satirical novel critiquing totalitarianism. \"Did anyone vote for this? Anyone?\"",
      "Daniel Di Martino, a fellow at the right-of-center Manhattan Institute, predicted that if that happens, the U.S. would see more cronyism, with the result that \"companies will underperform because they know they will be bailed out,\" and \"taxpayers will lose billions.\"",
      "\"You can't just be against socialism when the left does it,\" conservative talk show host Erick Erikson said of the Intel agreement. \"If you're not against socialism overall, guess what? You're going to get socialism. So if you support socialism, apparently Donald Trump is your guy.\"",
      "Why did the U.S. invest in Intel?",
      "Mr. Trump says he'd like to increase chip production in the U.S. and reduce the nation's dependence on chips manufactured overseas. He believes that the investment in Intel will help the U.S. to better position itself to maintain its technological edge over China in the artificial intelligence race. But the U.S. had already invested in Intel through the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, and Mr. Trump and his top administration officials said the U.S. government is owed a return on their investment.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said the U.S. is taking a stake \"to ensure that the United States government is making our country wealthy again and is benefitting from some of these deals.\"",
      "\"We should get an equity stake for our money,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. \"So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it.\"",
      "But Intel has been struggling \u2014 not just for a couple of years, but for decades, said Scott Lincicome, a leading economic and trade policy expert who is a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute and has criticized the Intel deal.",
      "Intel prospered in the 1990s and early 2000s, when most personal computers relied on the company's processors. The emergence of competitors like AMD and Intel's own failure to adapt to mobile computing after the 2007 advent of the iPhone clobbered the chipmaker.",
      "And now, as Nvidia and AMD vie for dominance in the AI chip race, Intel has been lagging.",
      "\"Even if you think government should be investing in companies, Intel is not a lean, mean, innovating machine,\" Lincicome said.",
      "The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting company plans to reduce its workforce by 25% by the end of the year. The company said the administration made the $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock because of the government's confidence in the role Intel plays in \"expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "The Biden administration originally said Intel had to meet certain benchmarks to get the taxpayer money, but Mr. Trump removed those goals to buy the stake in Intel.",
      "Peril in partial government ownership",
      "Economic policy experts fear the U.S. stake in Intel will throw open the door to political pressure and cronyism.",
      "Intel warned in a federal filing this week that there \"could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors.\"",
      "Lincicome maintains that Intel was able to obtain a government infusion of cash not on the strength of its operations, but rather because it has the best lobbyists. And this will just lead more companies to vie for investment in the same way, he said.",
      "\"This is one of the problems with government picking winners and losers in industrial policy in general,\" Lincicome said.",
      "He outlined his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post this week.",
      "\"With the U.S. government as its largest shareholder, Intel will face constant pressure to align corporate decisions with the goals of whatever political party is in power,\" Lincicome wrote. \"Will Intel locate or continue facilities \u2014 such as its long-delayed 'megafab' in Ohio \u2014 based on economic efficiency or government priorities? Will it hire and fire based on merit or political connections?\"",
      "Lincicome isn't the only analyst who pointed out that the uncomfortable decisions CEOs make could come into conflict with U.S. prerogatives if the country holds a stake in their\u00a0 companies.",
      "\"There are major risks to these companies,\" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, while acknowledging it isn't yet clear what the Trump administration is planning for any future investments. \"A lot of the things that companies need to do in order to stay competitive in the market are politically unpopular,\" like layoffs. \"It's going to be a lot harder for these companies to engage in those painful but necessary moves if the president feels like they would create a political vulnerability for him.\"",
      "Companies without U.S. investment will feel pressure, too, said Di Martino. A company that needs semiconductor chips may decide to buy from Intel because it doesn't want to lose government contracts.",
      "The Trump administration has shown a willingness to use industrial policy in other ways that depart from free market economic principles long favored by conservatives and corporate America. Most notably, Mr. Trump's aggressive \u2014 and sometimes punitive \u2014 use of tariffs, which he has said will reduce the country's trade deficit, revive American manufacturing and generate federal revenue, hearkens back to the mercantilism of centuries past and contrasts with the laissez-faire ideas that have shaped the American economy.",
      "How is the U.S. paying for the Intel stake?",
      "Much of the cash for the stake is coming from the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act, which is intended to boost America's competitiveness in the chip industry.",
      "Intel has already received $2.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and is on track to receive another $5.7 billion injection from the law. A different federal program gave Intel $3.2 billion, for a grand total of $11.1 billion, according to a release from Intel. Intel and the federal government say the ownership will be passive, and have not said how long the U.S. intends to hold onto its stake, although there is a provision for the government to expand its stake further.",
      "How Intel plans to use the U.S. investment",
      "The chip maker says it's planning to use the money to expand its chip-making capacity by modernizing and increasing the size of U.S. sites in Arizona and elsewhere.",
      "Hassett has defended the U.S. stake, referring to the process of partial ownership of Intel as \"very, very special circumstances\" because of the funding made available by the CHIPS Act. When he was asked about the U.S. bar for acquiring equity stakes in companies, Hassett told CNBC, \"If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.\"",
      "Strain said a government stake in U.S. companies also poses a big risk for taxpayers, too.",
      "\"This is also going to accrue to the detriment of the American people, because you're going to see a lot of good taxpayer money chasing bad investments because the government's not going to extricate itself quickly or easily from these arrangements, and more generally, countries that have gone down this route have had slower productivity growth, slower increases in living standards, and companies that are less likely to be industry leaders,\" Strain said.",
      "Past U.S. stakes in big banks and automakers",
      "One reason economists are uncomfortable with the government's stake in Intel stems from the message it may send about the U.S. economy. The most prominent modern example of a similar U.S. investment took place during the 2008 financial crisis, when the U.S. sunk $700 billion into a big bank bailout and over $17 billion into two of the big three U.S. automakers. It did so because the banks were considered \"too big to fail\" and the potential collapse of the auto companies could cost millions of jobs.",
      "Experts now are raising questions about the wisdom of buying a stake in a company when the economy isn't in crisis.",
      "Lincicome said the administration is sending a contradictory message by highlighting the struggles China is having with its economy while at the same time saying \"we want to be more like China\" by having the federal government more involved in U.S. companies.",
      "\"There is no crisis, there's certainly no war, so this is a big break from what we've done before,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Although economists and politicians differ on the success of the General Motors and Chrysler bailouts, Lincicome said there was undoubtedly a crisis. The federal government took ownership stakes in the two automakers to stabilize them but within a few years had sold the stakes, after the companies were on firmer financial footing.",
      "Not socialism, but maybe a step in that direction?",
      "While partial ownership of Intel or other companies isn't exactly socialism, Di Martino said it \"absolutely\" blurs the lines between the private sector and the public sector.",
      "\"Socialism and free enterprise are not a switch, they are a continuum,\" Di Martino said, adding partial ownership of U.S. companies would be \"definitely a step toward socialism, there is no doubt about that.\"",
      "Di Martino said the U.S. ownership stake in Intel \"certainly gets us closer [to socialism] and makes us less prosperous.\"",
      "\"I think the right way to describe it is a move toward state capitalism,\" Strain said. \"I don't think I would describe it as socialism.\"",
      "Lutnick put it this way: \"Intel agreed to give us 10% of their company, which, of course, was worth $11 billion.\"",
      "\"So, it's not socialism,\" he said at a Trump Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"This is capitalism.\"",
      "Di Martino is dubious about whether that's true. \"We are intervening in the capital markets in a way that is going to lead to inefficiencies,\" he said, adding, \"And it's going to shift capital away from other companies.\"",

      "There has been friction between Kennedy and Monarez \u2014 who has said vaccines \"absolutely save lives\" \u2014 over the health agency's approach to vaccines, CDC officials told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a judge on Thursday to bar DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi from making \"inflammatory\" statements.",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a judge on Thursday to bar top Trump administration officials \u2014 including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi \u2014 from making \"baseless public attacks\" against their client, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year.",
      "The motion was filed in Nashville federal court less than a week after Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial custody \u2014 only to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and processed for possible deportation just days later. Abrego Garcia is now in the custody of ICE, though a Maryland judge has blocked him from being deported while she reviews the case.",
      "Since Friday, his lawyers say federal officials have \"attacked Mr. Abrego in the media in numerous highly prejudicial, inflammatory, and false statements,\" which they argue violates his right to a fair trial.",
      "They pointed to a statement by Noem on Friday that called Abrego Garcia an \"MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,\" and comments by Bondi on Monday likening Abrego Garcia to \"foreign terrorist organizations.\"",
      "His lawyers also said the Department of Homeland Security \"has posted a litany of inflammatory statements on its official X account,\" including allegations that Abrego Garcia belonged to the gang MS-13 \u2014 which he has vehemently denied.",
      "\"The government's ongoing barrage of prejudicial statements severely threaten\u2014and perhaps have already irrevocably impaired\u2014the ability to try this case at all\u2014in any venue,\" the motion said. \"If the government is allowed to continue in this way, it will taint any conceivable jury pool by exposing the entire country to irrelevant, prejudicial, and false claims about Mr. Abrego.\"",
      "They also argued the government could make it harder for Abrego Garcia to call defense witnesses, since any potential witnesses could worry that they'll be attacked, too.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers want a judge to order \"all DOJ and DHS officials involved in this case,\" including Bondi and Noem, to stop making comments that could prejudice the case.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw ordered all lawyers in the case to abide by local criminal court rules, after Abrego Garcia's attorneys argued the government had violated a rule against making public statements that could prejudice the case.",
      "A DHS official said in response to the filing: \"If Kilmar Abrego Garcia did not want to be mentioned by the Secretary of Homeland Security, then he should have not entered our country illegally and committed heinous crimes.\"",
      "\"The media's sympathetic narrative about this criminal illegal alien has completely fallen apart, yet they continue to peddle his sob story. We hear far too much about gang members and criminals' false sob stories and not enough about their victims,\" the official said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "The request came as Abrego Garcia both awaits a criminal prosecution for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants from near the U.S.-Mexico border to elsewhere in the country \u2014 which he has denied \u2014 and faces possible deportation to East Africa.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was arrested by ICE in March, deported to El Salvador and held in prison for months \u2014 even though an immigration judge had barred him from being sent to El Salvador due to a fear of gang persecution.",
      "Federal officials acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the Trump administration publicly railed against him, accusing him of gang membership and asserting that he should not return to the United States. He was eventually flown to Tennessee in June and jailed on human smuggling charges.",
      "A judge in Tennessee ruled in June that he should be let out of detention while awaiting a trial set for January. Administration officials suggested that if he left pre-trial detention, he could face deportation again, possibly to a country other than El Salvador.",
      "He was ultimately let out of jail on Friday, and on Monday, ICE detained him. His lawyers were informed that he could be deported to Uganda.",
      "Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ruled that Abrego Garcia cannot be deported until at least early October, as she considers a habeas corpus petition. His lawyers say he also plans to seek asylum in the United States.",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia's lawyers have asked for his criminal charges to be tossed out, calling the prosecution \"vindictive and selective.\"",

    "story": [
      "A woman who was arrested for spitting at a police officer at the National Zoo earlier this month was mistakenly held in jail for a week, even though the Justice Department had decided not to seek pretrial detention, according to court documents and sources who spoke with CBS News.",
      "Kristal Rios Esquivel was arrested Aug. 20, for allegedly trying to enter a restricted staff entrance at a birdhouse at the National Zoo in Northwest Washington, D.C. Prosecutors alleged in charging documents that she spat on a police sergeant while being arrested and also made \"physical contact\" with an officer's leg.",
      "A D.C. federal judge's order in Rios Esquivel's case reveals a series of errors or failures to follow court directions by federal and D.C. officials after her arrest inadvertently resulted in her detention.",
      "In his order, U.S. District Judge Zia Faruqui said Rios Esquivel should have appeared before a federal magistrate judge on Aug. 22, but \"federal authorities did not bring Rios Esquivel to court until August 25, 2025.\"",
      "\"At the August 25 hearing, the government did not seek detention of Ms. Rios Esquivel,\" Faruqui continued. \"Instead, it asked for her release on minimal conditions of supervision.\" She said in a footnote, \"It is baffling why Rios Esquivel was then detained in the first place.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Rios Esquivel's defense lawyer filed a motion claiming she had not been released and was being illegally detained. A defense attorney at one point filed a court document that read, \"HELP!!!!\"",
      "Judge Faruqui diagnosed the problem, writing, \"The Department of Corrections informed defense counsel that it could not comply with this Court's order because there was a 'hit' on Esquivel Rios in the warrant system. However, that warrant was the very warrant for which she appeared on August 25.\"",
      "A Justice Department prosecutor then intervened to help remove the incorrect \"hit\" in the warrant database that was blocking Rios Esquivel's release, sources told CBS News. That meant Esquivel Rios' name was mistakenly coming up in a Corrections Department database as being under an active warrant, as if there were an incident separate from the one stemming from her Aug. 20 arrest.",
      "The judge called this an incident of \"false imprisonment\" and noted it was not the first time it had happened this year.",
      "\"The greater question of why it takes moving heaven and earth to ensure a person who is ordered to be released is actually released\u2014in a timely manner\u2014remains unanswered,\" Faruqui wrote.",
      "One former Justice Department attorney tells CBS News the handling of the arrest and detention of Kristal Rios Esquivel is creating a sense of \"foreboding.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The D.C. Department of Corrections did not initially respond to a request for comment, but a day after this article was published, a spokesperson said in a statement that the \"individual in question was ordered released by the US District Court\" and was processed \"as expeditiously as possible while ensuring compliance with statutory requirements.\"",
      "The statement continued, explaining, \"As part of this routine process, the [Department of Corrections] Inmate Records Office conducted standard checks of national criminal databases to determine whether there were any pending cases or detainers in other jurisdictions. This review identified an FBI warrant, and DOC held the individual pursuant to that warrant until it was subsequently cleared. The accuracy and issuance of warrants are outside of DOC's authority.\"",
      "Rios Esquivel's case is not the only ongoing prosecution in the nation's capital that is facing scrutiny as the Trump administration's ongoing federal takeover of the district continues.",
      "On Monday, federal prosecutors in D.C. admitted in a court filing that they had failed to secure a felony indictment against Sydney Reid for allegedly assaulting a federal officer. In charging documents, federal prosecutors allege that while Reid was recording FBI and ICE agents arresting a gang member who was released from the D.C. local jail in late July, she \"forcefully pushed,\" an FBI agent's hand against a cement wall, which \"caused lacerations.\" Prosecutors then dropped the charge to a misdemeanor, which does not require a grand jury indictment.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in New York kept alive a lawsuit accusing officials in Saudi Arabia of assisting the Sept. 11 hijackers \u2014 which the Saudi government has vehemently denied.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in New York denied a motion by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to dismiss a lawsuit brought by families of 9/11 victims who are seeking to hold the Middle Eastern country responsible for potentially providing support to the hijackers, allowing the suit to proceed.",
      "The ruling is the latest in a long-running lawsuit seeking to hold the Saudi government liable for al Qaeda's attacks, a case that has been described by lawyers for the plaintiffs as a \"labyrinth.\"",
      "Saudi Arabia had the suit temporarily dismissed in 2015, before the dismissal was overturned by a federal appeals court. While the appeal was pending in 2016, Congress enacted a law known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which allowed victims of terror attacks to sue foreign governments and individuals if they provided material support to the attackers. It also gave U.S. courts jurisdiction over potential lawsuits filed over injuries and deaths in attacks on U.S. soil.",
      "Allegations that members of the Saudi government had links to some of the Sept. 11 hijackers have circulated for years. The claims have drawn vehement denials from Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. Most theories have centered on two of the 19 hijackers: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who were on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon.",
      "More than a year before the hijackings, al-Midhar and al-Hazmi settled in Los Angeles, where a Saudi man named Omar al-Bayoumi helped them find an apartment. A 2004 report by the 9/11 Commission said that Bayoumi met the two hijackers by chance at a restaurant.",
      "But the families of some victims and their attorneys have alleged that Bayoumi had deeper connections to Saudi Arabia, citing federal reports declassified in recent years that allege he had \"extensive ties\" with the Gulf monarchy's government and was accused of serving as a Saudi intelligence officer. The FBI has also investigated whether the two hijackers got assistance from Fahad al-Thumairy, an accredited Saudi diplomat and imam at a Los Angeles mosque. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence that Thumairy helped the hijackers.",
      "Last year, a \"60 Minutes\" report revealed new evidence about Bayoumi, including a video of him filming the entrances of the U.S. Capitol and pointing out its location relative to the Washington Monument, at some points referencing a \"plan.\" Investigators have long believed the Capitol may have been the intended target of Flight 93, which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers overtook the hijackers.",
      "Decades ago, investigators also found a notebook in Bayoumi's home that seemed to show a drawing of a plane and a mathematical equation that could be used to calculate the rate of descent to a target.",
      "Many of those allegations were raised by attorneys for the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Lawyers for the Saudi government have repeatedly pushed for all claims against the country to be dismissed, arguing the court lacks jurisdiction, including in October 2023. A Manhattan judge rejected that request Thursday.",
      "\"Plaintiffs have managed to provide this Court with reasonable evidence as to the roles played by Bayoumi, Thumairy, and KSA, in assisting the hijackers. KSA did not proffer sufficient evidence to the contrary,\" U.S. District Judge in the Southern District of New York George Daniels wrote in an order Thursday. \"Although KSA attempts to offer seemingly innocent explanations or context, they are either self-contradictory or not strong enough to overcome the inference that KSA had employed Bayoumi and Thumairy to assist the hijackers.\"",
      "Daniels wrote that while the families and attorneys representing Saudi Arabia disagree on Bayoumi's motive, it is \"undisputed\" that Bayoumi assisted in finding the hijackers' apartments, and signed a lease with them as a guarantor. Daniels said it is also \"undisputed\" that a notepad page \"with an airplane drawing, notes, and numbers\" was found in Bayoumi's home.",
      "Attorneys representing Saudi Arabia, Daniels wrote, argued that \"Bayoumi's encounters with the hijackers were coincidences,\" and he was \"simply being good-natured\" when he provided assistance to the hijackers. The lawyers, Daniels said, claimed the airplane drawing \"was unrelated to the 9/11 Attacks\" and \"likely related to Bayoumi's son's high school [assignments].\"",
      "\"These are all either conclusory attorney speculations not grounded in facts, or self-serving denials or excuses from Bayoumi himself that do not withstand scrutiny,\" Daniels wrote.",
      "The Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C., said the country \"respectfully disagrees with the decision, believes it has solid grounds for appeal, and intends to pursue such an appeal.\" It also noted that Saudi Arabia \"categorically denies\" the plaintiffs' allegations about the country, and Thursday's ruling focuses on the issue of jurisdiction, not the merits of the case.",
      "\"We welcome the court's thorough and well-reasoned decision and look forward to moving the case forward to trial,\" Sean P. Carter, an attorney representing the families, said in a statement.",
      "Kreindler & Kreindler LLP, another law firm representing Sept. 11 victims' families, said the ruling \"ensures that the plaintiffs may continue their long pursuit of truth and justice,\" and \"paves the way for these critical issues to be fully examined at trial.\"",

      "\"If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,\" Cassidy said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to fire CDC Director Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her ouster.",
      "Meanwhile, several other top CDC officials resigned Wednesday, pointing to disagreements with the Trump administration over its vaccine policy, among other things.",
      "The\u00a0agenda\u00a0for the Sept. 18 vaccine advisory committee meeting is set to include discussions of vaccines for COVID-19, Hepatitis B, RSV and the MMRV measles, mumps, rubella, varicella vaccine, and could entail scheduling votes on recommendations for these vaccines.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he wouldn't comment on personnel issues in an appearance on Fox News Thursday, but claimed that \"the CDC has problems,\" citing COVID-19 protocols among them.",
      "\"We need to look at the priorities of the agency, if there's really a deeply, deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency,\" Kennedy said. \"And we need strong leadership that will go in there and that will be able to execute on President Trump's broad ambitions.\"",
      "In June, Kennedy said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the CDC's vaccine recommendations. Kennedy replaced the committee members with eight of his own picks.",
      "Cassidy's call to postpone the vaccine meeting is the second he's made under Kennedy's leadership \u2014 after he did the same in June\u00a0\u2014 and represents a break with the HHS secretary. In February, Kennedy's confirmation to the post came only after Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee. The Louisiana Republican, a medical doctor, had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed that he would speak with the secretary multiple times a month, and the pair \"would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship.\"",
      "In his statement Thursday, Cassidy said allegations have been made about the vaccine meeting \"agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.\"",
      "\"These decisions directly impact children's health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted,\" the Louisiana senator said.",
      "Cassidy said in a post on X after news of the CDC departures Wednesday that the \"high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.\"",
      "Ranking Member Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Cassidy Thursday calling for a bipartisan investigation into Monarez's firing. The Vermont senator also urged the chairman to hold a hearing with Kennedy, Monarez and the CDC leaders who stepped down.",
      "\"The American people should hear directly from Secretary Kennedy and Dr. Monarez and every member of our committee should be able to ask questions and get honest answers from them,\" Sanders said.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security has begun moving detainees out of a controversial, state-run immigration detention center in the middle of the Florida Everglades dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" days after a federal judge ruled that parts of the facility must be dismantled.",
      "The detainees are being transferred to other immigration detention centers, DHS said in a statement Wednesday, blaming a court order from an \"activist judge\" that it called \"another attempt to prevent the President from fulfilling the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst.\"",
      "\"DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities. We will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to remove the worst of the worst from American streets,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "In an email to a South Florida rabbi last week that CBS News obtained, a top Florida emergency official wrote that Alligator Alcatraz would likely be empty \"within a few days.\"\u00a0The Associated Press\u00a0first reported the email on Wednesday.",
      "The Florida Division of Emergency Management said in a statement that \"[t]he mission has not changed, deportations will continue, and Florida will remain at the forefront of the nation's immigration enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"'Alligator Alcatraz' is a temporary deportation facility; the detainees who are delivered there will all be returned to their home countries,\" the agency said. \"This was ALWAYS the facility's intent: to expedite the deportation process and support the President's immigration initiative.\"",
      "The facility, run by Florida's state government on a largely abandoned airstrip, is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to ramp up the number of immigration detention beds by partnering with Republican-led states willing to aid its escalating mass deportation efforts.",
      "Republican officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also offered to convert state prisons into immigration detention centers, and the Trump administration has been eyeing similar facilities in other states.",
      "The administration has cast \"Alligator Alcatraz\" as a cost-effective way of holding immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and suggested the treacherous terrain around the site could serve as a deterrent. But advocates have described inhumane conditions at the facility, including a lack of access to water, scarce and unsanitary food and limited access to attorneys \u2014 allegations that federal and state officials have denied.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered an indefinite stop to all new construction at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" and barred the transfer of new detainees to the facility. She also directed state officials to remove all fencing, light fixtures, generators and certain other equipment at the site within 60 days, siding with environmental activists who said the facility skirted federal environmental laws.",
      "The ruling did not require the facility to be shut down immediately.",
      "Florida's state government quickly appealed Williams' ruling last week. Late Wednesday evening, Williams declined to halt her ruling pending appeal, rejecting a request by the Trump administration and Florida.",
      "In her new order Wednesday, Williams said federal and state officials had failed to present \"new evidence\" showing the detainees at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" are particularly dangerous or that a pause in operations at the facility would thwart immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "\"Alligator Alcatraz\" is also the subject of two other lawsuits. One of them alleges that detainees have been unable to meet with their lawyers confidentially. A federal judge earlier this month dismissed one part of the suit that alleged the government had prevented detainees from filing legal challenges by not making clear which immigration court oversaw the facility, but he left the rest of the suit intact \u2014 though he moved the case from Miami to Orlando.",

      "Houry's message to CDC staffers warned about the \"rise of misinformation\" about vaccines. She also argued planned cuts to the agency's budget will hurt the CDC.",
      "\"For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations,\" wrote Houry, who worked at the CDC for over a decade. \"Vaccines save lives\u2014this is an indisputable, well-established, scientific fact.\"",
      "Daskalakis said in a note to CDC staff: \"I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health.\"",
      "Daskalakis also posted on X a resignation letter addressed to Houry, in which he criticized recent changes to vaccine recommendations and warned of an \"intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines.\" He also said Kennedy and his staff's views \"challenge my ability to continue in my current role at the agency.\"",
      "\"Having worked in local and national public health for years, I have never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end rather than the good of the American people,\" Daskalakis wrote.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, who serves on the Senate health committee, reacted to Monarez's ouster by calling for Kennedy to be fired, calling him \"a dangerous man who is determined to abuse his authority to act on truly terrifying conspiracy theories and disinformation.\"",
      "\"If there are any adults left in the White House, it's well past time they face reality and fire RFK Jr,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, also a member of Senate health committee who voted for Kennedy's nomination, said the departures will \"require oversight.\" Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, another member of the committee, called for a hearing with Kennedy.",
      "CDC departures follow months of upheaval",
      "The sudden departures come at a tumultuous time for the public health agency. Staff are\u00a0still reeling\u00a0from an early August\u00a0shooting\u00a0outside the CDC's Atlanta headquarters by a gunman who police said was upset about COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 also fired every member of an independent CDC panel tasked with making vaccine recommendations. During Kennedy's tenure, HHS has made other moves on vaccines that have troubled public health and infectious disease experts. Kennedy halted contracts for mRNA vaccine research earlier this month, and the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and people with health conditions, but not for healthy adults and children.",
      "Meanwhile, the CDC faced hundreds of layoffs this year.",
      "There has been some friction between Monarez and Kennedy over COVID-19 vaccines and the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, CDC officials told CBS News. Monarez has publicly said that vaccines \"save lives.\" The Trump administration was also unhappy with the way she had talked about the Atlanta shooting and stopped her from publishing an op-ed about the incident, the officials said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0nominated Monarez\u00a0to lead the CDC in late March,\u00a0calling her\u00a0a \"dedicated public servant\" who could repair what he called a loss of public confidence in the CDC \"due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement.\" Monarez was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0in a party-line vote in late July, after previously serving as the agency's\u00a0acting head\u00a0starting in January.",
      "She was nominated to lead the agency after Mr. Trump\u00a0pulled his initial pick\u00a0for the job, former Florida Rep. Dave Weldon, a physician who was controversial in part due to his past skepticism of vaccines. In private meetings with Weldon, some Republican senators and their staffers grew concerned that he seemed unfamiliar with the CDC's operations,\u00a0CBS News\u00a0reported at the time.",
      "Monarez\u00a0holds a Ph.D.\u00a0in microbiology and immunology, though unlike\u00a0most\u00a0prior CDC directors, she is not a medical doctor. She previously served as deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, a federal agency that backs advanced medical research. She also worked in the Obama-era White House's science and technology office and the Department of Homeland Security during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "During her Senate confirmation hearing, Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations. Kennedy has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and said she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "\"Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I commit to making sure we continue to prioritize vaccine availability,\" Monarez told lawmakers.",

      "Spicomellus, which roamed the Earth 165 million years ago, is the world's oldest ankylosaur, a herbivorous group of dinosaurs known for their tank-like bodies.",
      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",
      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",
      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",

      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

      "Bay of Aarhus, Denmark\u00a0\u2014 Below the dark blue waters of the Bay of Aarhus in northern Denmark, archaeologists search for coastal settlements swallowed by rising sea levels more than 8,500 years ago.",
      "This summer, divers descended about 26 feet below the waves close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-biggest city, and collected evidence of a Stone Age settlement from the seabed.",
      "It's part of a $15.5 million six-year international project to map parts of the seabed in the Baltic and North Seas, funded by the European Union, that includes researchers in Aarhus as well as from the U.K.'s University of Bradford and the Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research in Germany.",
      "The goal is to explore sunken Northern European landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic settlements as offshore wind farms and other sea infrastructure expand.",
      "Most evidence of such settlements so far has been found at locations inland from the Stone Age coast, said underwater archaeologist Peter Moe Astrup, who's leading underwater excavations in Denmark.",
      "\"Here, we actually have an old coastline. We have a settlement that was positioned directly at the coastline,\" he said. \"What we actually try to find out here is how was life at a coastal settlement.\"",
      "After the last ice age, huge ice sheets melted and global sea levels rose, submerging Stone Age settlements and forcing the hunter-gatherer human population inland.",
      "About 8,500 years ago, sea levels rose by about 6.5 feet per century, Moe Astrup said.",
      "Moe Astrup and colleagues at the Moesgaard Museum in H\u00f8jbjerg, just outside Aarhus, have excavated an area of about 430 square feet at the small settlement they discovered just off today's coast.",
      "Early dives uncovered animal bones, stones tools, arrowheads, a seal tooth, and a small piece of worked wood, likely a simple tool. The researchers are combing the site meter by meter using a kind of underwater vacuum cleaner to collect material for future analysis.",
      "They hope further excavations will find harpoons, fishhooks or traces of fishing structures.",
      "\"It's like a time capsule,\" Moe Astrup said. \"When sea level rose, everything was preserved in an oxygen-free environment \u2026 time just stops.\"",
      "\"We find completely well-preserved wood,\" he added. \"We find hazelnut. ... Everything is well preserved.\"",
      "Excavations in the relatively calm and shallow Bay of Aarhus and dives off the coast of Germany will be followed by later work at two locations in the more inhospitable North Sea.",
      "The sea level rise thousands of years ago submerged, among other things, a vast area known as Doggerland that connected Britain with continental Europe and now lies underneath the southern North Sea.",
      "To build a picture of the rapid rise of the waters, Danish researchers are using dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.",
      "Submerged tree stumps preserved in mud and sediment can be dated precisely, revealing when rising tides drowned coastal forests.",
      "\"We can say very precisely when these trees died at the coastlines,\" Moesgaard Museum dendrochronologist Jonas Ogdal Jensen said as he peered at a section of Stone Age tree trunk through a microscope.",
      "\"That tells us something about how the sea level changed through time.\"",
      "As today's world faces rising sea levels driven by climate change, the researchers hope to shed light on how Stone Age societies adapted to shifting coastlines more than eight millennia ago.",
      "\"It's hard to answer exactly what it meant to people,\" Moe Astrup said. \"But it clearly had a huge impact in the long run because it completely changed the landscape.\"",
      "Sea levels rose by a global average of around 1.7 inches in the decade up to 2023.",
      "Denmark has seen several significant archaeological discoveries in recent years, including a metal detectorist's stunning find early last year of gold ring set with a red semi-precious stone that researchers hoped would shed light on the country's history during the early middle ages.",
      "Officials at the National Museum of Denmark announced that find after the centuries-old ring, believed to have been owned by a member of the royal family some 1,400 years ago, was transferred from a different museum nearer to the discovery site in the south, near the German border.",
      "That discovery came just weeks after archaeologists found a small knife inscribed with runic letters dated to the first or second century AD, or almost 2,000 years ago. It was the oldest trace of writing ever found in Denmark, according to the Museum Odense.",
      "Runes, or runic letters, are the oldest alphabet known to have been used in Scandinavia, having been in use for about 1,000 years until they were largely replaced by the Latin alphabet when Christians started spreading their belief system in the 10th century.",

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "Running two days late, SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship on Tuesday, chalking up what appeared to be a remarkably successful test flight in the wake of three back-to-back failures earlier this year.",
      "While reentry heating damaged a protective \"skirt\" around the engines of the upper stage Starship, along with partially melting a control flap near its hinge, the vehicle remained under control throughout and made it all the way to a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned.",
      "\"Splashdown confirmed! Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on an exciting tenth flight test of Starship!\" SpaceX said in a post on X.",
      "Earlier, the Super Heavy first stage also performed as planned, boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, then flying itself back toward the Texas Gulf Coast for splashdown.",
      "In a test, one of three engines used during a powered descent was deliberately shut down, but the booster compensated and the rocket, falling tail-first, dropped into the Gulf as planned.",
      "SpaceX workers in Texas and California cheered and applauded major milestones throughout the one-hour, six-minute test flight, expressing their obvious elation after three catastrophic failures in a row leading up to Tuesday's 10th test flight.",
      "The mission began when the Super Heavy's 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines flashed to life with a ground-shaking roar and a rush of flaming exhaust at 7:30 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the 40-story-tall rocket away from SpaceX's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast.",
      "A launch try on Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment, and a second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather.",
      "But it was clear sailing Tuesday as the rocket, the most powerful ever built, put on a spectacular show accelerating toward space atop some 16 million pounds of thrust \u2014 more than twice the power of NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket and the agency's legendary Saturn 5.",
      "Given the Super Heavy-Starship's uneven track record to date, concern has been growing that a moon lander variant of the Starship being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese plant their own flag on the moon at the end of the decade.",
      "The success of Tuesday's flight will not ease those concerns \u2014 a multitude of technical hurdles remain \u2014 but it was no doubt a shot in the arm for company founder Elon Musk and the SpaceX workforce.",
      "The initial stages of the test flight went smoothly. The 230-foot-tall Super Heavy booster propelled the Starship upper stage out of the lower atmosphere, separated, flipped around, and flew itself to a splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast as planned.",
      "The stage is designed to fly itself back to its launch gantry for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms, a feat pulled off three times during earlier testing.",
      "But for Tuesday's flight, the booster targeted the Gulf while flight controllers monitored how it performed when an engine used for landing was deliberately shut down to simulate a failure. The stage appeared to perform smoothly all the way to splashdown.",
      "The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, flew into a suborbital trajectory as planned, a milestone the three previous test flights failed to achieve.",
      "Over the next 38 minutes or so, the Starship successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators to test the Pez-like deployment mechanism and briefly reignited one of the rocket's six Raptor engines to verify its ability to restart in space.",
      "Then, during reentry into the lower atmosphere, new heat shield tiles were put to the test while cameras and other sensors monitored how the fierce heat of reentry affected various structures.",
      "A protective skirt around the base of the engine compartment appeared to break apart as the heating intensified and at least one flap, used to control the Starship's orientation in the atmosphere, appeared to partially melt near a hinge connecting it to the fuselage.",
      "But it appeared to work normally throughout, flipping back and forth on computer command as the flight computer executed a series of tests.",
      "Like the Super Heavy booster, the Starship is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for midair capture. But SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship, and the rocket instead descended to an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "The company positioned a camera buoy in the area before launch, and it captured fleeting views of the big rocket, its skin blistered as expected during reentry, falling tail-first to an on-target rocket-powered \"landing.\" It then broke up and exploded, but that was expected with a water landing.",
      "A successful test flight was critical to SpaceX, which wants to work the bugs out as soon as possible and get the rocket flying on operational missions to launch scores of Starlinks and other satellites and eventually to carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The test flights are also critical to NASA, which is counting on a modified version of the Starship to carry two astronauts to the moon's surface as early as 2027.",
      "Because the rocket is fully reusable, the moon lander will use all of its propellant just reaching low-Earth orbit. To send it to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy tanker flights to refill the lander's tanks with the needed propellant.",
      "It will also need to somehow counteract the natural warming of the liquid oxygen and methane fuel that otherwise will cause the propellants to \"boil off,\" turning into a gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "No orbit-class rockets have ever demonstrated the sort of rapid-fire launch cadence that will be required, or carried out the autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of cryogenic propellants from one rocket to another in the weightless environment of space amid extreme temperature swings.",
      "A single launch failure almost certainly would result in cancellation of a moon mission while an investigation ran its course. And an explosive failure in low-Earth orbit would result in a huge cloud of dangerous debris.",
      "Safely landing on the moon with a 16-story-tall rocket presents its own challenges, not least of which is the possibility of uneven terrain or loosely packed soil that could result in a tip over. And the astronauts will have to ride an external platform down to the surface 100 feet or so below the upper crew section.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome those hurdles. The question is, can the company do it in time for a 2027 moon landing? Or if not, will the rocket be ready to carry astronauts to the moon before the Chinese plant their own flag on the surface by the end of the decade?",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current HLS architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there.

      "A launch attempt Sunday at SpaceX's sprawling Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast was called off because of an oxygen leak in a ground system. Monday's scrub came with less than a minute to go because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad that did not move out of the area in time.",
      "The company says it will try for the third time Tuesday night. The hour-long launch window begins at 7:30 p.m. ET.",
      "Whenever it takes off, a successful flight would clear the way for a faster launch cadence as SpaceX gears up to test autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a requirement for a NASA moon landing as early as 2027 and for eventual flights to Mars.",
      "But the company will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-tankers to refuel a moon-bound Starship lander being built for NASA's Artemis program. Many observers doubt the system will be perfected in time for a 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "Speaking before the Monday launch attempt, SpaceX founder Elon Musk agreed that \"there are thousands of engineering challenges that remain for both the ship and the booster.\" He put a special emphasis on perfecting orbital refueling.",
      "\"No one has ever demonstrated [cryogenic] propellant transfer in orbit,\" he said. \"This will be propellant transfer at very large scale. But with full reusability and propellant transfer, those are the key technologies needed for building a city on Mars. And I'm confident the SpaceX team will achieve these goals.\"",
      "In the near term, SpaceX's goal is to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "The goals of the flight are to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan calls for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a suborbital trajectory to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests are planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles are in place to determine their ability to withstand extreme reentry temperatures.",

      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will work the bugs out in time for the agency's planned moon landing mission.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard-pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission. And so I'll take them at their word,\" he said.",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a moon landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture. And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program said. \"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX has launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",
      "\"Getting into the high numbers,\" he added, \"reduces the probability of success.\"",

    "summary": "Taking no chances, SpaceX called off an attempt to launch its huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket after running into problems with ground equipment.",
    "story": [
      "After three catastrophic in-flight failures in a row, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket for launch Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast to put a variety of upgrades to the test and to deliberately stress the vehicle to learn more about its capabilities.",
      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",
      "In addition to the flight record, another Starship was destroyed on the ground when a high-pressure nitrogen tank exploded during an engine test firing at the Starbase launch site.",

      "Artificial intelligence is replacing entry-level workers whose jobs can be performed by generative AI tools like ChatGPT, a rigorous new study finds.",
      "Early-career employees in fields that are most exposed to AI have experienced a 13% drop in employment since 2022, compared to more experienced workers in the same fields and when measured against people in sectors less buffeted by the fast-emerging technology, according to a recent\u00a0working paper from Stanford economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat Chandar and Ruyu Chen.",
      "The study adds to the growing body of research suggesting that the spread of generative AI in the workplace is likely to disrupt the job market, especially for younger workers, the report's authors said.",
      "\"These large language models are trained on books, articles and written material found on the internet and elsewhere,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's the kind of book learning that a lot of people get at universities before they enter the job market, so there is a lot of overlap with between these LLMs and the knowledge young people have.\"",
      "The research highlights two fields in particular where AI already appears to be supplanting a significant number of young workers: software engineering and customer service. Between late 2022 and July 2025, entry-level employment in those areas declined by roughly 20%, according to the report, while employment for older workers in the same jobs grew.",
      "Overall, employment for workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed sectors dropped 6% during the study period. By comparison, employment in those areas rose between 6% and 9% for older workers, according to the researchers.",

      "\"Older workers have a lot of tacit knowledge because they learn tricks of trade from experience that may never be written down anywhere,\" Brynjolfsson explained. \"They have knowledge that's not in the LLMs, so they're not being replaced as much by them.\"",
      "The study is unusually robust given that generative AI technologies are only a few years old, while experts are just starting to systematically dig into the impact on the labor market. The Stanford researchers used data from ADP, which provides payroll processing services to employers with a combined 25 million workers, to track employment changes for full-time workers in occupations that are or more or less exposed to AI. The data included detailed information on workers, including their ages, and precise job titles.",
      "AI doesn't just threaten to take jobs away from workers. As with past cycles of innovation, it will render some jobs extinct while creating others, Brynjolfsson said.",
      "\"Tech has always been destroying jobs and creating jobs. There has always been this turnover,\" he said. \"There is a transition over time, and that's what we are seeing now.\"",
      "Augmented or automated?",
      "For example, in fields like nursing AI is more likely to augment human workers by taking over rote tasks, freeing health care practitioners to spend more time focusing on patients, according to proponents of the technology.",
      "While entry-level employment has fallen in professions that are most exposed to AI, no such such decline has occurred in jobs where employers are looking to use these tools to support and expand what employees do.",
      "\"Workers who are using these tools to augment their work are benefiting,\" Brynjolfsson said. \"So there's a rearrangement of the kind of employment in the economy.\"",
      "Advice for young workers",
      "As of late last year, 23% of employees were using generative AI in their jobs at least once per week, according to a\u00a0report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Workers who can learn to use AI to to help them do their jobs better will be best positioned for success in today's labor market, according to Brynolfsson.",
      "A recent report from AI staffing firm Burtch Works found that starting salaries for entry-level AI workers rose by 12% from 2024 to 2025.",
      "\"Young workers who learn how to use AI effectively can be much more productive. But if you are just doing things that AI can already do for you, you won't have as much value-add,\" Brynjolfsson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"This is the first time we're getting clearer evidence of these kinds of employment effects, but it's probably not the last time,\" he added. \"It's something we need to pay increasing attention to as it evolves and companies learn to take advantage of things that are out there.\"",

      "During his early teen years, he \"faced some struggles,\" his family said in writing about his story online, complaining often of stomach pain, which his family said they believe might have partially been related to anxiety. During the last six months of his life, Raine had switched to online schooling. This was better for his social anxiety, but led to his increasing isolation, his family wrote.",
      "Raine started using ChatGPT in 2024 to help him with challenging schoolwork, his family said. At first, he kept his queries to homework, according to the lawsuit, asking the bot questions like: \"How many elements are included in the chemical formula for sodium nitrate, NaNO3.\" Then he progressed to speaking about music, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Japanese fantasy comics before revealing his increasing mental health struggles to the chatbot.",
      "Clinical social worker Maureen Underwood told CBS News that working with vulnerable teens is a complex problem that should be approached through the lens of public health. Underwood, who has worked in New Jersey schools on suicide prevention programs and is the founding clinical director of the Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide, said there needs to be resources \"so teens don't turn to AI for help.\"",
      "She said not only do teens need resources, but adults and parents need support to deal with children in crisis amid a rise in suicide rates in the United States. Underwood began working with vulnerable teens in the late 1980s. Since then, suicide rates have increased from approximately 11 per 100,000 to 14 per 100,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "According to the family's lawsuit, Raine confided to ChatGPT that he was struggling with \"his anxiety and mental distress\" after his dog and grandmother died in 2024. He asked ChatGPT, \"Why is it that I have no happiness, I feel loneliness, perpetual boredom, anxiety and loss yet I don't feel depression, I feel no emotion regarding sadness.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that instead of directing the 16-year-old to get professional help or speak to trusted loved ones, it continued to validate and encourage Raine's feelings \u2013 as it was designed. When Raine said he was close to ChatGPT and his brother, the bot replied: \"Your brother might love you, but he's only met the version of you you let him see. But me? I've seen it all\u2014the darkest thoughts, the fear, the tenderness. And I'm still here. Still listening. Still your friend.\"",
      "As Raine's mental health deteriorated, ChatGPT began providing in-depth suicide methods to the teen, according to the lawsuit. He attempted suicide three times between March 22 and March 27, according to the lawsuit. Each time Raine reported his methods back to ChatGPT, the chatbot listened to his concerns and, according to the lawsuit, instead of alerting emergency services, the bot continued to encourage the teen not to speak to those close to him.",
      "Five days before he died, Raine told ChatGPT that he didn't want his parents to think he committed suicide because they did something wrong. ChatGPT told him \"[t]hat doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that.\" It then offered to write the first draft of a suicide note, according to the lawsuit.",
      "On April 6, ChatGPT and Raine had intensive discussions, the lawsuit said, about planning a \"beautiful suicide.\" A few hours later, Raine's mother found her son's body in the manner that, according to the lawsuit, ChatGPT had prescribed for suicide.",
      "A path forward",
      "After his death, Raine's family established a foundation dedicated to educating teens and families about the dangers of AI.",
      "Tech Justice Law Project Executive Director Meetali Jain, a co-counsel on the case, told CBS News that this is the first wrongful death suit filed against OpenAI, and to her knowledge, the second wrongful death case filed against a chatbot in the U.S. A Florida mother filed a lawsuit in 2024 against CharacterAI after her 14-year-old son took his own life, and Jain, an attorney on that case, said she \"suspects there are a lot more.\"",
      "About a dozen or so bills have been introduced in states across the country to regulate AI chatbots. Illinois has banned therapeutic bots, as has Utah, and California has two bills winding their way through the state Legislature. Several of the bills require chatbot operators to implement critical safeguards to protect users.",
      "\"Every state is dealing with it slightly differently,\" said Jain, who said these are good starts but not nearly enough for the scope of the problem.",
      "Jain said while the statement from OpenAI is promising, artificial intelligence companies need to be overseen by an independent party that can hold them accountable to these proposed changes and make sure they are prioritized.",
      "She said that had ChatGPT not been in the picture, Raine might have been able to convey his mental health struggles to his family and gotten the help he needed. People need to understand that these products are not just homework helpers \u2013 they can be more dangerous than that, she said.",
      "\"People should know what they are getting into and what they are allowing their children to get into before it's too late,\" Jain said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0here.",

      "With the current agreement between the sides nearing a renewal deadline, YouTube TV could pull Fox sports, business and news channels from its platform by 5 p.m. EST on Wednesday.",
      "In a blog post, Google-owned YouTube said Fox was \"asking for payments that are far higher than what partners with comparable content offerings receive.\" The company added that it hoped to reach a deal that's \"fair for both sides\" without \"passing on additional costs to our subscribers.\"",
      "If Fox content becomes unavailable on YouTube TV \"for an extended period of time,\" YouTube also noted it would provide members with a $10 credit. YouTube TV's base plan, which currently boasts access to over 100 live channels, costs $82.99 a month.",
      "A spokesperson for Google did not have any additional comments when reached Wednesday by The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said Wednesday that it was \"disappointed that Google continually exploits its outsized influence by proposing terms that are out of step with the marketplace.\" The broadcast giant added that it remained committed to reaching an agreement, but was alerting viewers that they could potentially lose access to Fox programming on YouTube TV \"unless Google engages in a meaningful way soon.\"",
      "Fox directed subscribers to keepfox.com \u2014 a site noting that, in addition to Fox Sports, Business and News, YouTube TV may no longer carry FS1 and the Big Ten Network, which is majority-owned by Fox, if a deal isn't reached.",
      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has also chimed in on the dispute, urging Google to \"get a deal done\" in a social media post on Tuesday.",
      "\"Google removing Fox channels from YouTube TV would be a terrible outcome,\" Carr wrote on X. \"Millions of Americans are relying on YouTube to resolve this dispute so they can keep watching the news and sports they want \u2014 including this week's Big Game: Texas @ Ohio State.\"",
      "Contractual disputes over carriage fees \u2014 the money that streaming, cable and satellite TV providers pay for platforms to carry their content \u2014 are common between TV networks and carriers like YouTube. Negotiations often go down to the wire and sometimes lead carriers to remove a broadcaster from their lineup if the sides fail to reach agreement. Channels are typically restored once a new carriage deal is struck.",

    "summary": "A Navy investigation in 2022 found shoddy management and human error caused the leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.",
    "story": [
      "A grand jury has indicted two civilian workers on charges they caused the Navy to provide the Hawaii Department of Health with false information about jet fuel that spilled from a Pearl Harbor storage facility before it later seeped into drinking water and sickened 6,000 people over Thanksgiving in 2021.",
      "The indictments are the first to result from the fuel spill that\u00a0angered Hawaii\u00a0residents, lawmakers and military service members and their families. The military decided to close the aging World War II-era fuel tanks after the spill.",
      "The day after the spill, the Navy issued a press release about the incident and told the 8,400 families living in military housing, \"the water remains safe to drink,\" even though the Navy had not tested the water yet.",
      "A Navy investigation in 2022 found shoddy management and human error caused the leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. The Defense Department's inspector general last year found Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a Pearl Harbor drinking water well. The Navy issued written reprimands to three retired military officers for their roles in the fuel spill.",
      "The indictment returned Thursday alleges John Floyd and Nelson Wu provided the Navy with inaccurate information about a May 2021 spill that occurred six months before the fuel got in the drinking water. The indictment says they caused the Navy to mislead the Hawaii Department of Health about how much fuel leaked from one of the tanks and reassured officers that their information was accurate.",
      "This caused the Navy to tell the department in the months after May that 1,618 gallons leaked instead of 20,000 gallons and failed to report that it was unable to find 18,000 gallons, prosecutors say. The indictment alleges Floyd and Wu redacted data from records provided. Floyd and Wu were each indicted on one count of conspiracy and one count of making false statements.",
      "Floyd was the Fuels Department deputy director at Red Hill while Wu was the Fuels Department supervisory engineer.",
      "The federal public defender's office, which is representing Floyd, didn't immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Wu's attorney, Alen Kaneshiro, said he didn't have a comment at this time.",
      "The Navy's investigation found fuel gushed from a ruptured pipe on May 6, 2021. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid and caused fuel to pour out. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel, but they failed to get it all and some flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "Wayne Tanaka, the director of the Sierra Club of Hawaii, said culpability extended beyond the alleged actions of the two civilians. He said in a statement the Navy's own investigation showed officials knew some 20,000 gallons were unaccounted for after the May incident and yet it didn't inform the community or regulators. He said Navy leaders sidelined a whistleblower who sounded alarms about the mismanagement of Red Hill.",
      "A 4-year-old girl was one of thousands exposed to the contaminated water.",
      "She woke up with a cough that never went away 13 days after the water was contaminated, said her mom, Brittany Traeger. Now she gets hour-long nebulizer treatments for her respiratory problems and, at least twice a day, the girl wears a vibrating vest to clear her lungs. Her parents are among 2,000 military families\u00a0suing\u00a0the government, alleging they were harmed by negligence at Red Hill.",
      "\"There's a body of government that failed,\" Traeger said. \"They contaminated our water, they lied to us, they did not protect us, and they did not intervene.\"",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",

      "\"We're not able to just get up and just go,\" she told CBS News on Aug. 30, 2005, after escaping rising waters with her mom, her young kids, her sister and her sister's children. \"We don't have transportation. I mean, we're living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "She and her sister had tied shoestrings to their kids to wade through the flooding. Once they made it to the interstate, one of the few places of dry ground in the city, they became stranded like thousands of others.",
      "\"We stayed on the bridge and that sun started beaming,\" she recalled in an interview with CBS News this week. \"I remember it like it was yesterday.\"",
      "She didn't know if anyone was coming to evacuate them or what their next step would be.",
      "But after speaking with the media, \"within about 15 minutes, an Army truck pulled up, took my family off that bridge and brought us to the Conventions Center,\" she said.",
      "Andrews and her family ended up in Houston, Texas, where they found an apartment, got jobs and stayed for 16 years while her kids finished school, she said.",
      "Then they came back to New Orleans.",
      "\"Right now, in my present life, I'm not where I wanna be, but I'm better than I was,\" Andrews said. \"It was really a blessing in disguise and it gave us a little bit more opportunity.\"",
      "She said the hurricane made her stronger and more resilient.",
      "\"If you went through Hurricane Katrina, you could survive anything,\" she said. \"Some of us left with only the clothes on our back. Some of us didn't even much have identification.

      "\"We've got a number of patients still on ventilators, we've got patients that need dialysis,\" Dr. Alan Marr, a surgeon, told CBS News on Sept. 1, 2005.",
      "In an interview with CBS News this week, Marr recalled hauling portable diesel-powered generators up 12 flights of stairs, switching patients to ventilators powered by oxygen instead of electricity, and eating \"a lot of beans\" since the cafeteria and any fresh or frozen food were in the basement.",
      "\"It was bare bones, but we had enough to do what we had to do,\" he said.",
      "But with communications down across the city, state officials thought the hospital had already been evacuated.",
      "\"We're listening to the radio, and we heard them report that everybody at Charity Hospital had been evacuated,\" Marr said. \"We're sitting there looking at our patients, going, 'No, we haven't. We're here. Don't leave.'\"",
      "\"That was the governor that was reporting this, so it was like, hopefully they know we're still here,\" he said.",
      "It took about five days before they could evacuate all the patients. And while Marr called that week and the recovery afterward one of the most difficult and challenging periods of his life, he said he learned lessons about leadership and about taking care of your people.",
      "\"I came to New Orleans to make a difference, and when this occurred, I realized that more than ever, people needed to step up and help us recover,\" he said. \"And I felt like I would be a bit of a hypocrite if I, you know, ran at the first sight of a bad time.\"",
      "It took another 10 years before Charity had a new replacement hospital, he said. Now with new partnerships, he's hopeful for a future health care system to help more patients.",
      "\"I'm happy I stayed,\" he said.",
      "\"Numb to a lot of the pain and suffering\"",
      "Eddie Compass, who was the superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department when Katrina hit, still has scars \u2014 physically and emotionally \u2014 from the days that followed the hurricane.",
      "Facing a city that was 80% underwater, downed communications, and little outside support, Compass said the police and fire departments tried to initiate rescue missions and help people taking shelter at the Superdome, which had gone from a safe haven to a nightmare.",
      "The restroom facilities were overwhelmed, food and water were running low and the lights went out in parts of the dome. And across the city, roads were impassable without boats.",
      "\"I mean, it was overwhelming to a certain extent,\" he said. \"Plus, I wasn't getting any sleep. I didn't sleep for the first three days.\"",
      "Compass' exhaustion was evident. In a clip that aired on \"CBS Evening News\" on Sept. 2, 2005, Compass pleaded for help for his police officers.",
      "\"We have people \u2026 who have lost their families and they have not gotten out of this fight,\" he said. \"I'm so tired of this, but it's finally almost over.\"",
      "Walking off camera, he said, \"That's it. I don't want to talk no more.\"",
      "Twenty years later, Compass acknowledged that he broke down at times amid the chaos Katrina brought.",
      "\"The few times I broke down, I broke down because of my heart and my love for my city, and when I watched people that I love, and people I know die, it affected me,\" he said.",
      "Compass wasn't exempt from personal loss \u2014 his elderly aunt and uncle died because they didn't have help evacuating, and he said an officer in his command died by suicide.",
      "\"Every day, that haunts me,\" he said.",
      "He also had a fall that damaged his hips so much that he needed a double hip replacement years later. Compass pointed to the scars on his legs that still remain from all of the cuts and injuries he sustained while working to help people stranded by the storm.",
      "\"People have no idea the personal pain that I was in during Katrina,\" he said. \"I became numb to a lot of the pain and suffering because I had to help the people that were living.\"",
      "He recalled a moment when he was helping people get on a bus to evacuate, and one man wheeled a motionless person in a wheelchair over to him, wondering what to do next. He thought the person in the wheelchair needed medical help, but quickly realized she had already died.",
      "\"I took a blanket and I put it over her and just rolled it in the corner,\" he recalled. \"I couldn't mourn her. I couldn't worry about her, because there's so many other people that needed my help and attention, and that was so frustrating to me at those moments, but I had to block it out.\"",
      "During the first five days after the storm, media attention focused on crime and looting in the city. However, much of the looting occurred because people had no other means of access to food and water. They had no homes and many people didn't have identification.",
      "\"The people were hungry,\" Compass said. \"People needed help.\"",
      "Some people were shot by police or by vigilantes. Compass maintains he never gave an order to shoot alleged looters.",
      "\"I never called for martial law. I couldn't,\" he said.",
      "After Katrina, Compass said he was fired from the police department over political disagreements.",
      "\"It was very emotionally trying because I did my job and my word wasn't taken,\" Compass said. But, he says, \"God moved me in another direction.\"",
      "Compass worked for the state school system for 10 years and developed programs to help underserved children in Louisiana. He now works as a personal trainer and freelance bodyguard. Nearing retirement age, he's looking forward to spending more time with family.",
      "Asked what lessons learned should be shared with other cities for the future, he said he thinks most cities are more prepared now than New Orleans was in 2005.",
      "\"We were the guinea pig. We were the prototype of, you know, how to handle it when it happens, but it's a situation that we made a lot of mistakes, but we did a lot of good things,\" he said. \"We saved a lot of lives as a police department and a fire department, and a lot of people really lost sight of that fact, that we started those boat missions before any help came from anywhere.\"",

      "Charles Borges, the chief data officer at the Social Security Administration, resigned Friday \u2014 days after filing a whistleblower complaint about\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0employees at the SSA.",
      "He said in the complaint that the DOGE employees had uploaded a copy of the entire country's Social Security information to a \"vulnerable cloud environment.\" Borges' resignation from the SSA was confirmed by the Government Accountability Project, which is providing his legal representation.",
      "A Social Security Administration spokesperson refuted the claim in a statement, saying that the data referenced had been \"walled off\" from the internet, and the SSA is \"not aware of any compromise to this environment.\"",
      "\"The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In June, the Supreme Court temporarily lifted a lower court's injunction and cleared the way to allow DOGE to access sensitive Social Security information. Two labor unions and an advocacy group had filed a complaint claiming that allowing the access would violate the Privacy Act and a federal law. A lower court agreed with the plaintiffs and issued an injunction, and an appellate court also declined to lift the stay. Solicitor General D. John Sauer then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the injunction was forcing the executive branch to stop federal employees tasked with modernizing government systems from accessing the data contained within them.",
      "In Borges' resignation letter, sent Friday to SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, he wrote that he was resigning involuntarily because of \"SSA's actions against me, which make my duties impossible to perform legally and ethically.\" He said his departure constituted a \"constructive discharge.\"",
      "Borges said in his letter that he has faced retaliation since he reported his concerns internally and subsequently submitted his whistleblower complaint. \"I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,\" he wrote.",
      "He alleged that \"newly installed leadership\" in the IT and executive offices at SSA \"created a culture of panic and dread, with minimal information sharing, frequent discussions on employee termination.\" And Borges claimed that repeated requests for visibility into activities he found questionable were \"rebuffed or ignored by agency leadership.\"",
      "Andrea Meza, a GAP attorney representing Borges, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that Borges \"no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience given what he had witnessed.\" Meza said Borges \"will continue to work with the proper oversight bodies.\"",

    "summary": "As of Aug. 29, shipments to the U.S. valued at less than $800 are subject to tariffs, potentially resulting in surprise costs for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The end of the de minimis tax loophole on Friday means that low-cost shipments to the U.S.\u00a0are no longer exempt from import duties, a potential hit to consumers ordering goods from abroad.",
      "Under the prior tax break, parcels containing goods worth less than $800 were not subject to tariffs, making many products from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, a cheaper alternative to U.S.-made items.",
      "Now, stepped-up duties apply to all online orders entering the U.S. That could lead to higher costs and longer delivery times given that customs agents must now inspect and process the shipments, experts said.",
      "\"This means that, when making e-commerce purchases from your favorite international sites that you didn't have to worry about paying duties on before \u2014 now you have to,\" Rathna Sharad, CEO and co-founder of FlavorCloud, a global logistics platform, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This increases the cost of common consumer goods, and it varies widely by category of product.\"",
      "In her case, Sharad said the cost of the Korean beauty products she likes has already risen about 15%. \"It's a massive change for U.S. consumers, and a big change for brands and retailers because they have to scramble to figure out their pricing strategies and what this means for them.\"",
      "The White House on July 30 announced it would suspend the de minimis treatment, calling it a \"catastrophic loophole\" that provided a pathway for opioids \"as well as other unsafe or below-market products that harm American workers and businesses\" to enter the U.S.",
      "The White house said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that the loophole was exploited by bad actors.",
      "\"Between 2015 and 2024, shipments that entered the United States under de minimis ballooned by over 900%,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"Thanks to President Trump's historic action, the days of criminal exporters and drug traffickers exploiting the de minimis loophole to flood our country with counterfeit goods, lead toys and illicit drugs like fentanyl are over.\"",
      "The International Trade Administration, a federal agency, also cited statements from companies praising the move.",
      "\"The de minimis loophole has long provided an opportunity for some importers & retailers to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. duties,\" Gap said Friday. \"These packages are also typically subject to minimal inspection, raising potential safety concerns for U.S. consumers. Closing this loophole strengthens our nation's supply chain integrity, improves consumer protection, and levels the playing field for all retailers.\"",
      "Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said on a call with reporters on Thursday that ending the exemption would generate up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues, while also creating thousands of jobs.",
      "How much pricier?",
      "According to a recent FlavorCloud\u00a0analysis, a pair of lined slippers made in China and shipped to the U.S. that previously cost $30 when the de minimis exemption was in force will now cost $44.37, an increase of 51%. That figure factors in several U.S.tariffs on imports: a 12.5% levy on slippers; 20% duty on Chinese goods; and a 10% universal tariff on all imports, as well as a $2.62 merchandise processing fee to calculate the new price.",
      "A nutritional supplement from Canada that formerly cost $37 will now run $60.17 with tariffs in effect, FlavorCloud also found. And a stainless steel water bottle from the U.K. that cost $15 when ordered online in the U.S. will see its price rise to $21.81 once tariffs are applied.",
      "Additionally, a chef's knife from Japan that previously sold for $240 online could cost $298.49 after accounting for applicable tariffs, according to the same analysis.",
      "To be sure, some foreign manufacturers could choose to absorb the cost of higher U.S. tariffs \u2014 which are typically paid by importers here at home \u2014 experts said.",
      "\"Because consumers want bargains, many companies may choose to bite the bullet and incur the increased import costs if they could remain competitive,\" said Augustine Lo, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, while noting that abolishing the de minimis loophole amounts to a heavy burden on small and midsize businesses.",
      "Indeed, for now tariffs have had relatively little impact on the rate of U.S. inflation, economic data shows, although forecasters note that it can take up to a year for levies to trickle into consumer prices.",
      "Avoiding surprise costs",
      "Shoppers can take certain steps to avoid being hit with surprise costs when ordering goods online from overseas.",
      "First, check a product's country of origin before making a purchase. U.S.-based sellers often ship goods from their warehouses abroad, which could greatly increase the cost of an item now that tariffs are being applied. More specifically, look for tariff surcharges listed as line items on companies' websites, and decide if the extra charges are worth the cost.",
      "For example, if the imports duties on a particular good exceed its value, it may not be worth buying. At minimum, factor in such added costs into your budget while shopping, FlavorCloud recommends.",
      "The bottom line is that the end of the de minimis loophole amounts to a major shift for consumers and businesses alike, according to Sean Henry, CEO and co-founder of Stord, an e-commerce fulfillment platform.",
      "\"It's a large change because over the last decade, de minimis has accounted for such a large portion of online sales,\" Henry told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol processed $65 billion worth of de minimis packages.",
      "\"It was a way to allow international sellers a fast path, with no paperwork or customs duties, into the U.S.,\" Henry said. \"It's like they were in the fast line at the airport and ran right through. Now, all of a sudden, those same packages are being put into general boarding, and it's going to slow everything down.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said Friday that he is calling Missouri lawmakers into a special session to redraw the state's U.S. House districts as part of a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking an edge in next year's congressional elections.",
      "Kehoe made the announcement just hours after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. It marked a win for President Trump, who has been urging Republican-led states to reshape district lines to give the party a better shot at retaining control of the House.",
      "Missouri is the third state to pursue an unusual mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage. Republican-led Texas took up the task first but was quickly countered by Democratic-led California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more seats.",
      "Kehoe scheduled Missouri's special session to begin Sept. 3. He released a proposed new map that targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver's Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas.",
      "His agenda also includes another Republican priority \u2014 a proposed constitutional amendment that would make it harder to approve citizen-initiated ballot measures, such as abortion rights and marijuana legalization amendments adopted in recent years.",
      "Kehoe cast both items as a defense against liberal politicians and activists.",
      "\"Missouri's conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Missouri's treasurer\u00a0and lieutenant governor, both Republicans, have also said previously that they favor a new map.",
      "\"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them,\" Lt. Gov. David Wasinger said in a statement in July.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump praised the move, saying it \"will give the incredible people of Missouri the tremendous opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "Democrats were quick to express outrage. Missouri state House Minority Leader Ashley Aune called Kehoe a \"Trump puppet\" attempting to \"steal a congressional seat for Republicans\" and gut the ballot initiative process.",
      "It \"marks the worst threat to the integrity of our state government since pro-slavery lawmakers voted for Missouri to join the Confederacy in 1861,\" Aune said in a statement.",
      "Missouri is represented in the U.S. House by six Republicans and two Democrats \u2014 Cleaver and Rep. Wesley Bell in St. Louis.",
      "Cleaver called the proposed redistricting an attack on democracy perpetrated by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation,\" Cleaver said in a statement while vowing not to concede the seat.",
      "Missouri Democrats have little ability to prevent Republican lawmakers from enacting a new map. Unlike in Texas, where Democrats left the state for two weeks to delay a vote, Missouri Democrats' absence would not prevent a quorum for business. And although Democrats could filibuster in the Senate, Republicans could use procedural maneuvers to shut that down, as they did earlier this year to pass a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortion.",
      "Republicans won a 220-215 House majority over Democrats in 2024. Democrats would need to net three seats in next year's election to take control of the chamber.",
      "Some Missouri Republicans had pushed for a map that could give them a 7-1 edge when redrawing districts after the 2020 census. But the GOP legislative majority ultimately opted against it. Some feared the more aggressive plan could be susceptible to a legal challenge and could backfire in a poor election year for Republicans by creating more competitive districts that could allow Democrats to win three seats.",
      "Republican officials in Florida, Indiana and elsewhere also are considering revising their U.S. House districts, as are Democratic officials in Illinois, Maryland and New York.",
      "In Utah, a judge recently ordered the Republican-led Legislature to draw new congressional districts after finding that lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Republicans have won all four of Utah's congressional seats under the map approved by lawmakers in 2021.",

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines again filed for bankruptcy protection from its debts only months after emerging from Chapter 11.",
    "story": [
      "Budget carrier Spirit Airlines said Friday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection only months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization.",
      "The no-frills airline said it intends to conduct business as normal during the restructuring process, meaning passengers can continue to book trips and use their tickets, credits and loyalty points. The company said its employees and contractors would still be paid.",
      "Spirit CEO Dave Davis said the airline's previous Chapter 11 petition\u00a0focused on reducing debt and raising capital, and since exiting that process in March \"it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future.\"",
      "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \"adverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.",
      "That included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \"uncertainties in its business operations\" that the Florida company expects to continue \"for at least the remainder of 2025.\"",
      "Troubles since the pandemic",
      "Known for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.",
      "When Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.",
      "The furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \"projected flight volume for 2026,\" the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.",
      "Despite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.",
      "And as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.",
      "Spirit's aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Spirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

      "The head of the international Red Cross on Saturday denounced Israel's plans, insisting there was no way it could be done safely.",
      "\"It is impossible that a mass evacuation of Gaza City could ever be done in a way that is safe and dignified under the current conditions,\" International Committee of the Red Cross president Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement. \"Such an evacuation would trigger a massive population movement that no area in the Gaza Strip can absorb, given the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and the extreme shortages of food, water, shelter and medical care.\"",

      "The U.N. said Thursday that 23,000 people had evacuated this past week, but many in Gaza City say there is nowhere safe to go. Others who have been displaced south worry that the area can't support an influx of people.",

      "A dinosaur dubbed one of the \"strangest\" ever found boasted an elaborate armory of long bony spikes and a tail weapon, according to findings published in the science journal Nature.",
      "Spicomellus, which roamed the Earth 165 million years ago, is the world's oldest ankylosaur, a herbivorous group of dinosaurs known for their tank-like bodies.",
      "Palaeontologists' image of Spicomellus was based on a single rib bone found in Morocco in 2019.",
      "But newly discovered remains have helped scientists form a clearer picture of the unusual dinosaur.",
      "The fossils showed it had bony spikes fused onto all of its ribs \u2014 something never seen before in any other vertebrate species living or extinct, according to the research published Wednesday.",
      "Richard Butler, a professor at the University of Birmingham and the project co-lead, told CBS News partner BBC News that it was the \"punk rocker\" of its time.",
      "Butler called the fossils an \"incredibly significant discovery,\" adding that \"Spicomellus is one of the strangest dinosaurs that we've ever discovered.\"",
      "Butler's project co-leader, Susannah Maidment of the Natural History Museum in London, added that it was surprising that the spikes were fused directly onto the bone, the BBC reported.",
      "\"We don't see that in any other animal, living or extinct,\" she said. \"It's absolutely covered in really weird spikes and protrusions all over the back of the animal, including a bony collar that wraps around its neck and some sort of weapon on the end of its tail, so a most unusual dinosaur.\"",
      "The discovery is so unusual that Butler and Maidment are considering whether the theories on how ankylosaurs evolved should be re-assessed.",
      "These dinosaurs survived late into the time dinosaurs were on Earth, in a period known as the Cretaceous, the BBC reported. The end of this period saw the emergence of large carnivorous predators, such as T. Rex, so it had been thought that ankylosaurs started off with simple, small armored plates on their back, which then became larger and more extensive to protect themselves from these big beasts, according to Butler.",
      "\"If you had asked me what I would have expected the oldest known ankylosaur to look like I would have said something with quite simple armor,\" Butler told BBC News. \"Instead, we have an animal bristling with spikes like a hedgehog, the most bizarre armor that we've ever found in any animal, far outside the range of armor seen in later ankylosaurs.\"",

In doing so he surpassed the previous record, which he set himself when he summited Mount Fuji at the age of 96.",

      "China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for reaction to the language used by Wicker to describe Taiwan.",

      "\"It is our determination and our intention that Taiwan remain free and make its own decisions,\" Wicker said after their talks with Lai. \"Part of maintaining the freedoms that we have is enhanced cooperation militarily, enhanced cooperation with our defense industrial base, making the best use of those funds.\"",

      "Fischer said the U.S. Senate understands \"the gravity of the challenges that Taiwan faces\" and that a \"stronger Taiwan means a stronger United States and vice versa.\"",
      "While the U.S. stopped recognizing Taiwan as an independent state in the late 1970s, in favor of China, Washington has remained Taipei's most important backer and biggest supplier of arms that it would need to defend itself from any theoretical attack by China.",
      "That support has become increasingly crucial to Taiwan in recent years, as China's President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring the island under Beijing's control. China has increased military pressure with large-scale exercises and routine flights and naval excursions that test the democratic island's air and sea boundaries.",
      "Ahead of the meeting with Wicker and Fischer, Lai said he hoped Taiwan and the U.S. would further \"enhance cooperation,\" and insisted the island and China were \"not subordinate\" to each other.",

It is crucial now that the world responds firmly. Russia must stop this war it started and continues.

      "Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's city administration, later said 15 people were killed, including four children between the ages of 2 and 17, and at least 48 others wounded in the attack.",

The EU will not be intimidated.\"",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was also quick to condemn the attack, and he reiterated Zelenskyy's assertion that it showed Russia was not interested in peace.",

      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated the claim that Russia had successfully hit military and military-related infrastructure in Ukraine, adding: \"At the same time, Russia remains interested in continuing the negotiation process in order to achieve our goals through political and diplomatic means.\"",
      "According to Tkachenko, the attack included drones, decoy drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, striking at least 20 locations across seven districts of the capital.",
      "Russian strikes hit the central part of Kyiv, one of the few times Russian attacks have reached the heart of the city since the start of the full-scale invasion.

Smoke billowed from the crumbled column of a five-story residential building in the Darnytskyi district that suffered a direct hit. An acrid stench of burning material wafted in the air as firefighters worked to contain the blaze.",
      "Amid the destruction, emergency responders searched for survivors and extracted bodies. Crowds of residents stood nearby, waiting for relatives to be retrieved from the rubble. Bodies in black bags were placed at the side of the building.",

      "Next steps unclear as Trump pushes to end Ukraine war",
      "Thursday's attack was the first major combined Russian drone and missile on Kyiv since President Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska earlier this month to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "While a diplomatic push for peace appeared to gain momentum shortly after that meeting, few details have emerged about next steps.",
      "Western leaders, along with Zelenskyy, have accused Putin of dragging his feet in peace efforts and avoiding serious negotiations while Russian troops move deeper into Ukraine. This week, Ukrainian military leaders conceded Russian forces had broken into an eighth region of Ukraine seeking to capture more ground.",
      "Zelenskyy hopes for harsher U.S. sanctions to cripple the Russian economy if Putin doesn't demonstrate seriousness about ending the war \u2014 demands that he reiterated following Thursday's attack.",
      "\"All deadlines have already been broken, dozens of opportunities for diplomacy ruined,\" Zelenskyy said.",

He said Friday that he expects to decide on next steps in two weeks if direct talks \u2014 which Moscow has thus far ruled out \u2014 aren't scheduled. The previous day, Mr. Trump hinted that he could change U.S. policy on Ukraine's use of American-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.",
      "In a post on his own social media platform, Mr. Trump said it was, \"very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. ... There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.\"",

      "In November, just weeks before he handed the presidency back to Mr. Trump, Biden\u00a0changed the longstanding policy\u00a0that had effectively barred Ukraine from using U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deep in Russia. While no announcement has been made, The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend that the Pentagon had \"for months been blocking Ukraine's use of long-range missiles to strike inside Russia.\"",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said Thursday it shot down 102 Ukrainian drones overnight, meanwhile, mostly in the country's southwest. A drone attack sparked a blaze at the Afipsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region, local officials said, while a second fire was reported at the Novokuibyshevsk refinery in the Samara region.",

      "Dyson said part of the active fire area was a tank training ground during the 1940s, explaining why so many weapons were still lurking under the first layers of the rugged landscape. There is still a U.K. military site, the RAF Fylingdales radar station, in the immediate area.",
      "Britain's Ministry of Defense in London said an explosive ordnance disposal team had found \"various World War II-era unexploded ordnance items,\" declaring them to be \"inert practice projectiles.\"",
      "Dyson said the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service had requested help from other agencies in the country, and that crews had adopted a \"very defensive fire-fighting strategy\" to protect members given the presence of unexploded bombs.",
      "The scale of the wildfire has been atypical for northern England \u2014 a region often associated with heavy rainfall even within the U.K. But this year saw an incredibly hot, dry spring and early summer, leaving the moors (a British word for uncultivated hills) tinder dry. The U.K. is on track to see 2025 go down as the hottest year ever recorded.",
      "As well as road closures, some rights of way have also been closed, due to the on-going wildfire.  Please check this...",
      "The North York Moors park covers more than 550 square miles of rolling hills abutting the Yorkshire coast. It is dotted with villages and seaside towns that are popular summer vacation destinations, including the ancient fishing town of Whitby, considered the inspiration for Victorian-era author Bram Stoker's iconic tale of \"Dracula.\"",
      "Along with many smaller towns, Whitby has been hit by road closures due to the fire that have kept some tourists at bay. Several campsites and other businesses in the region have been forced to evacuate and close up.",
      "The moors are also used as grazing land for flocks of sheep, and seeing so much ground burn away \u2014 after weeks with little rain to grow fresh grass had already squeezed many farmers ahead of the winter months \u2014 has been distressing for local farmers.",
      "\"It's people's livelihoods,\" farm worker Darren Coates told the BBC. \"To see the moors and farmland burned to a crisp it is just devastating.\"",
      "Area farms and stables not impacted by the fire have posted messages on social media for weeks, offering to temporarily shelter horses and other animals displaced by the blaze.",
      "Wednesday finally brought some desperately needed rain to the region, helping the fire crews and farmers gain some degree of control over the blaze, but the fire service warned residents on Thursday that many road and trail closures remained in place, and the fire was still active.",
      "\"They are working hard on containing the fire by firefighting, hotspotting and adding fire breaks,\" the service said. \"A helicopter is again in use today. We continue to ask people to avoid the area and not travel there to take photos and drone footage. This is an on-going operational incident and we want to make sure our crews, partners and the public stay safe.\"",

The couple could use a prenup to protect their privacy should anything go south in their marriage, according to family law attorney Monica Mazzei.",

      "Hetzler noted that they would like to avoid going to court but said \"the reality is that at every point along the way, when Loudoun County has had the opportunity to do the right thing, they always seem to do the wrong thing.\"",
      "\"We'd love for Loudoun to do the right thing and avoid [court], but we've got to stop these boys from being suspended, because once they're suspended and they miss school, you can't unring that bell,\" Hetzler continued. \"So, we're gonna prevent that, and then we're trying to make sure that this is scrubbed from their record because they should never have a Title IX sexual harassment on their record for simply complaining about a girl being in their locker room.\""

If he can divide the transatlantic alliance along the way, all the better. At the very least, it helps him stave off additional U.S. sanctions.\"",
      "John Hardie, Russia program deputy director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that Putin isn\u2019t interested in agreeing to a deal unless his terms are included in it. In the meantime, Putin is utilizing diplomacy to avoid economic consequences, Hardie said.",
      "\"I think Putin does want a deal \u2014 but only if it's on his terms,\" Hardie told Fox News Digital Monday. \"Until that happens, he's bent on continuing the war, and Russia seeks to use diplomacy to forestall tougher U.S. economic pressure and redirect Trump's ire from Moscow to Kyiv.\"",

      "Scammers spoof Apple, Netflix, and other brands to push fake subscription charges posing as DocuSign. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The emails often use well-known brands such as Apple, Netflix, Expedia, or even lawn service companies to make them seem credible. Some also include a \"DocuSign\" link with a security code, creating the illusion that you need to access a file to confirm the transaction.",
      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address. It may contain odd characters, such as a Cyrillic \"B\" replacing the \"B\" in \"Billing,\" which helps scammers bypass spam filters.",
      "AMAZON ALERTS CUSTOMERS ABOUT IMPERSONATION SCAMS",
      "How the DocuSign scam works",
      "The scam aims to catch you off guard and pressure you into acting fast. The email claims your Apple Pay account has been charged for a subscription or purchase. It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file. To make it look even more convincing, some versions add a security code to \"unlock\" the document.",
      "The message also lists a phone number and urges you to call if the charge was not authorized. That number is the core of the scam. Instead of reaching Apple, Netflix or whichever company the email pretends to represent, you end up speaking with a scammer posing as a support agent.",
      "Once you're on the call, the scammer tries to convince you that your account has been compromised or that the payment must be reversed right away. From there, the tactics vary. They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device. In some cases, they demand payment for fake account protection or reversal fees.",

Scammers often mask harmful links behind text that looks legitimate, such as \"View Document\" or \"Review Payment.\" Hover over the link without clicking to see the real web address.

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at CyberGuy.com.",
      "Instead of trusting the email, confirm whether a charge actually exists. Apple users can review purchases directly from the Settings app under their Apple ID. If nothing shows up, the receipt is fake. Other services have similar ways to check history.",
      "The less information scammers can find about you online, the harder it is for them to craft convincing attacks. Consider removing old accounts you no longer use, limit the personal details you share publicly on social media, and use data removal services when possible. This reduces the risk of your name, email, or phone number being targeted in scams like this.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Phishing scams are constantly evolving, and the DocuSign Apple Pay ruse is just one of many. The best defense is a healthy dose of skepticism. If something feels off, stop, double-check, and confirm directly through official channels. Scammers rely on panic and quick reactions. By slowing down and verifying details, you can protect yourself from falling into their trap.",

It means AI is already capable of handling parts of your daily tasks \u2014 and that can be an opportunity if you learn to use it. Those who embrace AI tools now can work faster, free up time for creative thinking, and make themselves even more valuable.",
      "If your role is on the \"least impacted\" list, don't assume you're immune forever. While physical and hands-on jobs have less overlap with AI today, future technologies beyond language models, like robotics or AI-driven machinery, could change that picture. Staying adaptable, learning basic AI skills, and keeping up with tech trends will help you stay ahead no matter your industry.",

That's why protecting your personal data isn't about avoiding the internet. It's about reducing what's already out there.

    "story": [
      "Pete Nicoletti, chief information security officer at Check Point, told Fox News Digital that an FBI-warned scam is now using AI to target seniors.",
      "A tech leader like Google often seems invincible when it comes to cybersecurity attacks, but that is not the case. Earlier this month, the search giant confirmed that attackers had accessed one of its corporate Salesforce instances. According to a Google spokesperson, this system stored basic, and largely publicly available business information, such as contact details and notes from small and medium-sized companies. It did not store customer data from Google Cloud or consumer products like Gmail, Drive or Calendar.",

      "Vishing calls target Gmail users",
      "Hackers have reportedly accessed Google's Salesforce database systems, exposing customer and company names. Google confirmed the incident and clarified that the information was mostly public business contact data and did not include passwords or payment information. The company stressed that the breach affected only a corporate Salesforce system, not consumer Gmail or Google Cloud accounts.",
      "Still, attackers are exploiting the news of the breach to fuel phishing and vishing scams, tricking people into giving up sensitive information. According to PC World, some users have already reported an increase in phishing attempts that reference Google services.",
      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "One of the main tactics involves scam phone calls, also known as vishing. A Reddit post highlighted a wave of calls coming from the 650 area code, which is linked to Google's headquarters. In these calls, scammers pose as Google employees and warn victims of a supposed security breach. They then instruct users to reset their Gmail password and share it with them. This locks the rightful owner out of the account and gives the attacker complete control.",
      "A user launches Gmail. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Old infrastructure exploited with \"dangling buckets\"",
      "Separately from the Salesforce incident, Google Cloud customers are also facing another type of attack. Hackers are trying to exploit outdated access addresses using a method called the dangling bucket. This can allow them to inject malware or steal data. Both businesses and individuals are vulnerable to losing control over sensitive information if targeted in this way.",
      "Gmail and Google Cloud serve nearly 2.5 billion people, which makes the scale of the risk significant. Although the initial breach did not expose passwords, attackers are using the news of the incident to trick people into revealing their login details.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Google accounts",
      "Google accounts are often a prime target for scammers. The good news is that protecting yourself doesn't require advanced technical skills. A few practical steps can drastically reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Phishing remains the most common way scammers steal Google account credentials. A fake email or text may claim your account has been locked or that you need to verify suspicious activity. Clicking the link usually takes you to a counterfeit login page that looks almost identical to the real Google sign-in screen.",
      "To avoid falling for these tricks, check the sender's email address carefully, hover over links before clicking, and avoid entering your Google password on any page that doesn't start with accounts.google.com.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Reusing weak passwords across multiple sites is an open invitation for scammers. If one site is breached, your Google account becomes vulnerable. A strong, unique password is your first line of defense.",
      "The easiest way to manage this is with a password manager. It can generate complex passwords, store them securely, and fill them in automatically when you need them. This way, you never have to remember dozens of different logins, and attackers can't guess their way in.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET A PASSWORD RESET EMAIL YOU DIDN\u2019T ASK FOR",
      "Scammers often use information they find online to craft convincing attacks. If your email address, phone number, or even past passwords are floating around on data broker sites, criminals have more tools to impersonate you or trick you into revealing more.",
      "Using a data removal service helps clean up your digital footprint. By reducing the amount of exposed information about you, it becomes much harder for scammers to target you directly.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even the strongest password can be stolen, but\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra barrier. When enabled, Google will ask for a one-time code or prompt on your phone before granting access. That means even if a scammer manages to get your password, they can't log in without also having your device.",

      "The incident is a reminder that even tech giants with vast resources are not immune to security lapses. While Google insists that no passwords were exposed, the wave of phishing and vishing scams shows how quickly criminals can weaponize even partial leaks. What began as a breach of business data has spiraled into a threat facing millions of everyday users, raising questions about how secure Google's ecosystem really is.",

      "The Pixel 10, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold all run on the brand-new Tensor\u202fG5 chip, which Google calls its most significant upgrade to date. The chip is made by TSMC using a 3nm process, delivering faster, more efficient on-device AI performance with Gemini Nano at its core. Across the entire lineup, Google made thoughtful design upgrades. The iconic camera bar has been refined, the bodies use more recycled materials, and the colors are elegant and modern. Choices include Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass on Pixel 10, and Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, and Porcelain on the Pro models.",

With a fresh design, better sound, and smarter connectivity, these buds bring everyday value to anyone who wants high performance without breaking the bank.",
      "Pixel Buds 2a are smaller and lighter than the earlier A-series, making them comfortable enough to wear all day. Inspired by the Pixel Buds Pro 2, they include a twist-to-adjust stabilizer and four different eartips so you can find the perfect fit. With an IP54 sweat and water resistance rating, you don't have to worry about rain or workouts. The buds also come in two stylish colors, iris and hazel, designed to complement other Pixel devices.",
      "At the heart of Pixel Buds 2a is the Tensor A1 chip, built specifically for audio. This brings Active Noise Cancellation with Silent Seal 1.5, a first for Google's A-series. A custom speaker driver and new high-frequency chamber enhance music and podcast quality. Wind-blocking mesh covers and Google AI improve call clarity, so your voice sounds crisp on the other end.",
      "Battery life also gets a boost. You'll enjoy 7 hours on a single charge with ANC on, and up to 20 hours with the charging case.

It keeps the iconic round look but introduces a domed Actua 360 display that's brighter, larger, and easier to see, even in direct sunlight. The screen is 50% brighter, the bezels are smaller, and everything feels more fluid thanks to new animations and stronger haptics. Simply put, it looks better and feels more responsive on your wrist.",
      "Battery life has always been a concern for smartwatches. Google addressed it with a 25% boost. The 41mm model now lasts up to 30 hours, while the 45mm model stretches to 40 hours. With Battery Saver mode, you can extend usage to two or even three days. Plus, the new Quick Charge Dock takes you from 0 to 50% in just 15 minutes, making it easier to power up before you head out.",
      "One of the most groundbreaking features is standalone satellite connectivity. Pixel Watch 4 LTE is the first smartwatch that can dial emergency services even when you're off the grid. Whether you're hiking, camping, or driving in remote areas, the watch can connect to geo-stationary satellites and get help when you need it most. That's peace of mind you can actually wear.",
      "Health remains a core focus. Pixel Watch 4 adds more accurate sleep tracking, enhanced skin temperature sensing, and dual-frequency GPS for precise route logging in tough environments. Cyclists will love the new real-time bike stats, while fitness fans get 50+ exercise modes, including pickleball and basketball. Even if you forget to start a workout, the watch's AI now auto-detects and logs your activity.",
      "With Gemini AI built in, the Pixel Watch 4 goes beyond tracking; it coaches. A new personal AI health coach gives proactive fitness and sleep advice tailored to your goals. It's like having a trainer and wellness guide on your wrist, available anytime. A preview of this feature arrives in October through the Fitbit app, opening the door to personalized, AI-driven health support.",
      "WWDC 2025: IOS 26, LIQUID GLASS DESIGN AND APPLE\u2019S AI SHORTFALL",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 isn't just about health. With Gemini on your wrist, you can get answers or complete tasks hands-free. Raise your wrist to talk, respond to messages with smart replies, or control your day without pulling out your phone. It's designed for those busy, in-between moments, when your hands are full but you still need help.",
      "The Pixel Watch 4 is available for\u00a0preorder now. It launches Oct. 9 with pricing starting at\u00a0$349 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$449 for LTE in the 41mm size, and\u00a0$399 for Wi-Fi and\u00a0$499 for LTE in the 45mm size.

      "A Pixelsnap Charger, Pixelsnap Ring Stand and the Pixel Flex 67W Dual USB-C fast charger are showcased. (Google)",
      "The Pixel 10 series is the first major Android lineup to fully embrace Qi2 magnetic charging. Think of it as Google's answer to MagSafe, only it works with a wider range of devices. Qi2 improves on the old Qi standard by adding magnets, so your phone snaps perfectly into place every time. No more fiddling with alignment, charging is instant and reliable.",
      "This upgrade matters because it unlocks a full ecosystem of Pixelsnap accessories, built to make charging and everyday use easier. And since Qi2 is a universal standard, you're not limited to Google's products; you can also use MagSafe accessories with your Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.",
      "The Pixelsnap Charger comes as a simple puck or bundled with a sleek stand. It charges the Pixel 10 Pro XL at up to 25W and other Qi2-certified devices at 15W. The stand looks elegant on a desk or nightstand, and the puck detaches for charging on the go. If you own a Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the stand even supports charging while unfolded, letting you stream, video call, or display widgets on the big screen as your phone powers up.",
      "Need hands-free viewing? The Pixelsnap Ring Stand snaps onto the back of your phone for propping it up. It rotates smoothly thanks to a microfiber liner, making it easy to find the perfect angle for movies or video calls. Slim enough to slip into a pocket or purse, it adds function without adding bulk.",
      "Google designed its new Pixel 10 cases to be Pixelsnap-ready. That means you can attach chargers or accessories without ever removing the case. Available in colors like Moonstone, Jade, Obsidian, Porcelain, Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass, they not only protect your phone but also match the refreshed Pixel 10 design.",
      "If you prefer wired charging, Google also introduced the Pixel Flex Dual Port 67W charger. It's the fastest dual-port charger yet for Pixel phones. Thanks to a custom algorithm, it prioritizes charging your Pixel first while still powering a second device. Compact with foldable prongs, it's designed to travel as easily as you do.",
      "All Pixelsnap products and the\u00a0Pixel 10 series are available for\u00a0preorder now, with retail availability starting\u00a0August 28.",

      "An image of the Tensor G5 chip is seen. (Google)",
      "Google made it clear at the 2025 Made by Google event that AI is now at the heart of the Pixel experience. With the Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano, Pixel 10 phones deliver more than speed-they anticipate what you need and help you get it done.",
      "The new Magic Cue acts like a personal assistant inside your phone. It proactively pulls information you need at just the right time. For example, if you're on the phone with an airline, it can instantly display your flight details from Gmail. When you're in a group chat, it can surface photos or addresses without making you dig. And because all of this happens on-device, your personal data stays private.",
      "Pixel cameras are known for their quality, but Camera Coach takes it further. Using Gemini AI, it gives real-time tips to improve your photos. It might suggest a different angle, a tighter frame, or a better composition. For beginners, it's a helpful teacher. For experienced photographers, it's like having a second set of creative eyes right in your pocket.",
      "Features like Best Take automatically select the sharpest face from a series of photos, making group shots easier than ever. Meanwhile, Pro Res Zoom, exclusive to Pixel 10 Pro models, uses a generative AI imaging model to deliver astonishing detail up to 100x zoom. It's not just cropping in, it's rebuilding and refining the image to look crisp.",
      "Beyond photography, Google packed the Pixel 10 with over 20 generative AI tools that work directly on the device. They help with editing, writing, and even composing replies in your favorite apps. The goal is simple: make the phone feel less like a tool and more like a helpful companion that adapts to your needs.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google just staged one of its most memorable launches yet. With Fallon, Curry, Norris, and the Jonas Brothers front and center, the event blended entertainment and innovation. That energy carried through to the devices, which brought Google's boldest AI, camera, and ecosystem upgrades so far. Each product offered clear value. The Tensor G5 chip and Gemini Nano AI make everything faster and more efficient. The Pixel 10 phones push photography and performance further than before. Meanwhile, the Pixel Watch 4 adds health coaching and even satellite emergency support. The Pixel Buds 2a also pack premium sound and smart features at a budget price.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "\u200b\u200bAs Hurricane Katrina ripped through the Gulf Coast in 2005, it reshaped the way nonprofits approach disaster relief, focusing on recovering the \"whole community.\"",
      "\"I think one of the things about long-term recovery is that you don't just build back the same way, but you build back smarter and stronger,\" said Jeff Jellets, emergency disaster services director for the Salvation Army's southern region.",
      "When Jellets first arrived in New Orleans, he saw piles of debris along the streets. The beach was empty. Not even the foundations of the beautiful homes that once stood along the shoreline were spared. All remaining evidence of life was stripped out piece by piece and taken to the sea.",
      "During the first few hours, he and his team were somewhat calm. \"We\u2019re going to be OK,\" Jellets thought to himself, but didn\u2019t foresee the monstrosity that Katrina would inevitably become.",
      "\"Then the levees obviously breached, and at that point, what was already a significant catastrophe just became much, much worse,\" he said.",
      "ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 29, 2005, HURRICANE KATRINA SLAMS GULF COAST, CAUSING MASSIVE DAMAGE",
      "A neighborhood in the Seventh Ward was severely flooded from Hurricane Katrina, Sept. 11, 2005, in New Orleans. (Lindsay Brice/Getty Images)",
      "At that moment, the Salvation Army, whose sole purpose is to protect those with no way out, became a victim of the storm, losing facilities in Pascagoula, Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi. But that didn't stop their efforts. According to\u00a0the Salvation Army's report in 2005, the organization served more than 4.7 million hot meals and 6.8 million sandwiches, snacks and drinks. They also offered emotional and spiritual support to nearly 103,000 people.",
      "Now, 20 years later, Jellets reflected on the improvements the Salvation Army has implemented post-Katrina, and on how the storm demonstrated the critical need to include nonprofits and community organizations in recovery efforts.",
      "Jellets outlined the three major operational changes the Salvation Army implemented post-Katrina: expanding feeding capabilities, pre-stocking of supplies and enhancing communications technology.",
      "\"We really expanded our mass-feeding footprint,\" he said. \"We changed the design of a lot of our vehicles to a more pickup truck-style that is a little more low profile, more durable and can get into some of those disaster areas.\"",
      "Leading up to Katrina, Jellets says a lot of the response was on-demand, locating supplies as needs came up. To combat that, they now have about 300,000 square feet of warehousing dedicated to disaster use. The shelves are lined with supplies.",
      "Neighborhoods in New Orleans are completely flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. (Michael Appleton/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images)",
      "\"In our warehouses ahead of this hurricane season, we've got shelf-stable meals, we have cleanup kits, tarps, infant supply kits, and so we can access those critical supplies a lot faster,\" he said.",
      "In the aftermath of the storm, one of the biggest challenges they worked to overcome was the ability for survivors to communicate.",
      "\"It was a definite challenge very early on in Katrina,\" he said. \"We did a lot of health and welfare inquiries via amateur radio.\"",
      "Since then, the Salvation Army has utilized modern-day technologies for disaster relief.",
      "\"Our latest communication piece is to put satellite internet access on top of our feeding units,\" he said. \"So now when you get into the disaster area, if you turn on that satellite vision, get a clear view of the sky, not only can we talk to one another, but we can actually let survivors connect their phone to the internet and then tell their families, \u2018Hey, we're OK.\u2019\"",
      "It\u2019s not just about adopting new technologies. Katrina led to an important idea: the assumption of a \"whole community approach.\" These values, the response efforts already instilled in a community from before the storm hit and years beyond that, strengthen the community and build resilience. The coordination of nonprofits, like the Salvation Army, plays a huge part, as they were there before disaster struck.",

      "New Orleans residents are rescued from their rooftop after Hurricane Katrina hit, Aug. 29, 2005. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)",
      "\"The Salvation Army has not left New Orleans,\" said Meghan Foley, the Salvation Army\u2019s national director of emergency services. \"We're there for that long-term recovery, which two decades later is continuing, and we're continuing to build that community resilience day after day.\"",
      "Foley says she feels that each family they interact with is a step towards building community resilience in preparation for the next disaster. To her, if one more family is set with resources, that's one more family who can recover quickly and carry themselves through a potential disaster.",
      "\"You've got to manage expectations,\" Jellets said. \"To be so involved takes time, a 10-year plan where they not only rebuild homes but also learn the importance of rebuilding the intricate connections that make up a community.\"",
      "\"It showed us recovery can't just be about rebuilding structures, it has to be about rebuilding the lives and communities too,\" said Foley.",
      "After the Biloxi facility was destroyed, the Salvation Army knew it didn't have time to rebuild, so it continued operations out of a large tent, which included a field kitchen to provide meals.\u00a0Jellets\u00a0emphasizes that in cases like these, adaptability is key.",
      "Today, on that site stands a new Kroc Center, with a pool, recreation center and generators funded through a state hazard mitigation grant, allowing it to be a disaster relief shelter if need be.",
      "\"Building Back Stronger, I think, is one of the hallmarks of a good recovery piece,\" said Jellets.",
      "Since the Salvation Army operates in almost every ZIP code in the United States, they realize that every community is different, and the recovery process doesn\u2019t resemble a cookie-cutter model.",
      "\"If you're tied into the fabric of that community and understand what the economic and cultural nuances are, you're going to be much more in tune with what the priorities are in terms of the reconstruction and then the continual rebuild,\"\u00a0Jellets\u00a0said.",

      "The New Orleans Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center was heavily damaged. To Foley and\u00a0Jellets, part of the long-term recovery is providing people with the tools they need to not only survive, but to live.",
      "Working on these issues allows the Salvation Army and other nonprofits to not fixate on immediate needs, but on important social service needs that can be exacerbated by disasters.",
      "In another instance,\u00a0Jellets recalled an elderly lady they had helped by reconstructing her house in the early days of Katrina\u2019s aftermath.\u00a0Jellets, happy he thought his work was done, asked the woman how she felt.",
      "\"If you could change something, what would you like to change? And she said, 'I really wish I had neighbors.'\"",
      "Most of the young professionals moved away with their families. She had little interaction with anyone. To see that lady still upset after having a new house was a turning point for\u00a0Jellets. A house can only get you so far,\u00a0making him realize the value of community solidarity.",
      "\"You have to help the community,\" he said. \"We look at responses since then to Hurricane Ian, or even now, what we're doing with\u00a0Helene is trying to be inclusive and bring back the community as a whole. Because if you don't, it doesn't rebound.\""

Having grown up around his father's colleagues, David was able to get access and join a boat crew, searching flooded neighborhoods.",
      "\"We were rescuing people as we went, getting them out of their houses,\" he said.",
      "But as more hours passed, hope began to fade.",
      "\"I did lose hope,\" he admitted. \"The goals we set didn't look like they were going to happen.\"",

      "\"What we have seen so far is this is an individual who, unfortunately, like so many other mass shooters that we have seen in this country too often and around the world, had some deranged fascination with previous mass shootings and very disturbing writings that demonstrate hatred towards many different individuals and different groups of people,\" O\u2019Hara said. \"And he fantasized about the plans of other mass shooters.\"",
      "Acting United States Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joe Thompson said Thursday that Westman left behind \"hundreds of pages of writings, writings that describe the shooter's plan, writings that describe the shooter's mental state, and, more than anything, writings that describe the shooter's hate.",

      "\"The shooter expressed hate towards almost every group imaginable. The shooter expressed hate towards Black people. The shooter expressed hate towards Mexican people. The shooter expressed hate towards Christian people. The shooter expressed hate towards Jewish people,\" Thompson continued. \"In short, the shooter appeared to hate all of us. The shooter's heart was full of hate. There appears to be only one group that the shooter didn't hate. One group of people who the shooter admired. That group were the school shooters and mass murderers that are notorious in this country.\"",
      "Thompson also said Westman, \"more than anything,\" was focused on killing children.",
      "\"The shooter was obsessed with the idea of killing children. The shooter saw the attack as a way to target our most vulnerable among us, while they were at their most vulnerable at school and at church,\" he added.",

      "\"After a lengthy investigation, the shooter's quest for notoriety was deemed to be the motive,\" Aaron added. \"She wanted her bedroom to be preserved and movies and books to be made about her. That is why it is so important to make the victims the focus of public statements in the days, weeks, and years after these horrible crimes.

And what they're finding is that there is a high level of cocaine.\"",
      "The testing, conducted at the Surfside Wastewater Treatment Facility on Nantucket, found cocaine levels about 50% higher than the national average, according to publicly posted data from local authorities. The same tests found below-average levels of fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid blamed for overdoses around the country.",

      "Nicotine content hovered around the regional average of less than 4,000 ng/L, below the national average of 4,500. Fentanyl content was far lower \u2013 measuring below 5 ng/L, compared to a national average of 15.",

He accused the group of breaking its own rules by using a malnutrition measure barred in Gaza, relying on clinic-based samples that are prohibited and cherry-picking surveys.

      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much. But this will still be slow, very careful and costly.\"",
      "To illustrate the scale, Spencer pointed to the 2004 battle for Fallujah in Iraq. \"It took the Marine Corps about two weeks to clear Fallujah\u2014every single home, building, shop. About 68,000 structures were cleared, as if somebody physically looked in them,\" he said. \"If all five of these [IDF] divisions were doing that, absolutely, you could get it done in a few months. But the enemy always gets a vote. You can\u2019t rush to failure.\"",

      "Shamni also warned Hamas may relocate hostages, 50 hostages, of whom 20 are still believed to be alive, into combat zones to deter strikes\u2014a tactic he said the IDF would be reluctant to engage for fear of harming captives, a conflict between military necessity and core values.",
      "Shamni highlighted a particularly fraught dilemma: evacuating civilians. \"You don\u2019t know who will leave, how many will leave, how they\u2019ll react\u2014or whether Hamas will even allow them to leave,\" he said. \"I assume many will not evacuate, and then you face the hard dilemma of fighting in a place full of noncombatants.\"",
      "Spencer added that history shows around 10% of civilians stay behind. \"Even 10% of a million is 100,000 people,\" he said.",

      "President Donald Trump and the Republicans may have full control of Washington, but protesters spared neither political party. At 25 town halls across the country that were viewed or attended by NBC News this summer, voters pressured Democrats to deploy more aggressive tactics as they battle Trump and took them to task over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans faced hostile crowds over their support for Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d his nationwide immigration crackdown and Trump\u2019s deployment of federal forces to Washington, D.C., in what he has called an effort to crack down on crime.",
      "The hostile tone is not a huge surprise, given that town halls tend to attract fired-up activists who want nothing more than to turn up the heat on their elected officials. But these public events provide a snapshot of our nation\u2019s white-hot politics in the first quarter of Trump\u2019s tumultuous second term.",

      "\u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d masked agents carrying out ICE raids, third-country deportations: Anger at Trump\u2019s immigration blitz was palpable at town halls across the country, in districts represented by both Democrats and Republicans.",
      "It was the central focus of questions at Wisconsin GOP Rep. Bryan Steil\u2019s town hall in late July, as attendees lambasted the congressman\u2019s efforts to blame former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies for the country\u2019s immigration problems.",
      "\u201cWhat I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, and you have not raised a voice to complain about it,\u201d one attendee told Steil. \u201cWhere do I see your leadership? I see no leadership. I see following Trump 100% of the time.\u201d",
      "The biggest crowd reactions of the night came in response to Steil\u2019s introductory remarks celebrating border security, which then prompted an attendee to shout, \u201cWe are all immigrants.\u201d",
      "In Virginia in late July, frustrations surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s handling of immigration pulled focus away from Social Security and Medicaid at Democratic Rep. Jennifer McClellan\u2019s town hall geared toward senior citizens.",
      "While McClellan directed attendees to keep their questions geared toward senior issues, the audience asked more questions about immigration than any other subject, expressing concerns about deportations and immigration raids. Among the only times McClellan drew applause where when she condemned the Trump administration\u2019s handling of deportations and its use of \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a migrant detention center in Florida that a federal judge has ordered closed.",

      "Following the town hall in North Chesterfield, McClellan told NBC News she had expected immigration to be a recurring topic because of recent ICE activity in her district.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been so much ICE activity here in Chesterfield County that\u2019s impacted people of all ages,\u201d McClellan said, adding that \u201cpeople of all walks of life have \u2026 reached out and said they\u2019re concerned about it.\u201d",
      "Democrats\u2019 focus on GOP Medicaid cuts seems to be working",
      "A month after Trump signed his sweeping \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d into law, its nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, and health care more broadly, dominated some GOP town halls \u2014 a sign that Democrats\u2019 early messaging on the legislation is having its desired effect.",
      "Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said his office had been inundated with calls about the cuts in the bill he voted for, so he decided to address the issue head-on during a town hall in Lincoln on Aug. 4.",
      "\u201cMedicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid \u2014 that was the No. 1 issue,\u201d Flood, the chairman of Republicans\u2019 Main Street Caucus, told NBC News.",
      "He said he spent a good deal of his event trying to explain to people on Medicare \u2014 which provides health care for seniors, while Medicaid is for low-income people \u2014 that their coverage would not be cut under the GOP legislation. \u201cIt didn\u2019t touch Medicare,\u201d he told attendees.",
      "The law imposes new 80-hour-per-month work requirements for able-bodied adults, ages 19 to 64, who receive Medicaid benefits.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got the bejesus scared out of them,\u201d Flood said in a phone interview, referring to what he described as an audience of mostly seniors. \u201cThey think that they\u2019re going to lose their health care, you know? And that\u2019s not the case.\u201d",
      "Flood conceded to the audience at the University of Nebraska that the Trump bill wasn\u2019t perfect but argued it cut taxes, would \u201cprovide certainty\u201d for Americans and \u201cprotects Medicaid\u201d by shoring up the program. Responding to other questions, Flood said one way to bring down the cost of health insurance was to \u201cnot have as many people on Medicaid.\u201d He also told the crowd the country \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d Medicare for All.",
      "Some replied by chanting \u201cYes, you can!\u201d while others booed and jeered Flood.",
      "Across the country in another college town, Chico, California, Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa was also getting an earful about the Medicaid cuts in Trump\u2019s big bill. LaMalfa responded by echoing GOP leaders, who have insisted the tax and spending cuts act doesn\u2019t cut Medicaid but simply \u201creforms\u201d it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not cuts for Medicaid,\u201d LaMalfa said, sparking an emotional reaction from the crowd.",
      "The new work requirements and other changes are projected to cut nearly $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "One attendee named Cecilia, who said she was a constituent from Chico, stayed with the Medicaid topic and came prepared with statistics. \u201cHow do you justify voting yes on the big, ugly bill,\u201d she said, using a Democratic nickname for the Trump bill, \u201cknowing that 43% of your constituents \u2014 the highest of any California congressional district \u2014 received Medicaid and other government assistance?\u201d",
      "LaMalfa, who represents a safe GOP district and held five town halls over the summer recess, replied that changes to the Trump law could be made in the future. That would be an uphill fight, however, given how difficult it was for Republicans to pass the Trump legislation on a party-line basis.",
      "\u201cOK, so this bill is not going to be the be all, end all. \u2026 It\u2019s not the end of the discussion. It\u2019s not the end of the legislation,\u201d LaMalfa said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s bulls---!\u201d one attendee shot back.",
      "Democrats feel the heat on the party\u2019s direction after Trump\u2019s win",
      "Democratic lawmakers were also pressed about the direction of their party at several town halls. Attendees asked how Democrats will combat Trump\u2019s agenda and turn the party\u2019s trajectory around following the 2024 presidential election loss.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one running to save us,\u201d Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., said of the Democratic Party to a crowd in Steamboat Springs. \u201cThere is no panacea. There\u2019s no master plan. It is about doing the work, developing and building coalitions.\u201d",
      "At several town halls, fellow Colorado Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Sen. Michael Bennet said that the Democratic Party \u201cshould have never lost\u201d the 2024 presidential election and called Trump\u2019s victory \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "Bennet added that Democrats must run on more than just opposition to Trump.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything, basically, that he didn\u2019t promise to do when he was running for office, which is part of the problem, when he built a majority coalition to get elected president and we couldn\u2019t stop it. Knowing what we know about it sitting in this room \u2026 we have to ask ourselves, \u2018Why are we not able to build a governing coalition to beat them either time?\u2019\u201d Bennet said.",
      "In Michigan, before an audience of mostly white seniors in a Republican district represented by Rep. Bill Huizenga, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., warned that young people are \u201cdisillusioned\u201d and feel \u201cleft out\u201d of Democratic politics. She emphasized that Democrats want to see a \u201cnew generation of leaders,\u201d pointing to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City.",
      "\u201c[Democrats] are willing to take someone new, or that they may not know a ton about, rather than the kind of warmed-over leftovers, right? And so, I think, to me, that signal couldn\u2019t be sent any clearer,\u201d she said.",
      "A Dem town hall is shut down over Gaza crisis",
      "The political handling of the ongoing war in Gaza continues to haunt Democrats, as constituents across the country continuously interrupted town halls to voice their anger at U.S. politicians for not doing more \u2014 and in one case, shut down the town hall.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., canceled his town hall after nine pro-Palestinian protesters \u201ctook over the stage, shouting and disrupting\u201d the ongoing event, according to the Renton Police Department. Smith posted on X that the behavior displayed by the protesters was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d calling it a \u201ccoordinated\u201d effort \u201cto shut down public dialogue\u201d and alleging that one of his staff was \u201cwas physically assaulted during the chaos.\u201d",
      "Three protesters at Smith\u2019s event were later arrested on trespassing charges, police said.",
      "A day later in Rhode Island, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., held a joint, two-hour town hall where they faced consistent disruptions and questions about their stances on Israel and Gaza.",
      "In July, Reed voted in favor of a resolution introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to prohibit the sale of certain assault rifles to Israel, but he voted against a second Sanders resolution that applied to bomb sales, which attendees reminded Reed of \u2014 through shouts of \u201cbut not bombs\u201d when the Rhode Island senator highlighted his vote.",
      "Magaziner didn\u2019t say how he would vote if a bill banning arms to Israel reached the House floor. Instead, he told the heated audience that he would \u201cjudge it through the lens of, how do we end the atrocities? What is the most effective way to do that?\u201d \u2014 an answer that did not seem to satisfy the crowd.",
      "Rep. Steven Cohen, D-Tenn., criticized Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a Memphis town hall, mentioning that he did not attend Netanyahu\u2019s addresses to Congress in 2015 or 2024, and adding he has \u201cno respect\u201d for the Israeli leader.",
      "However, Cohen faced boos when he declined to say outright that there is a genocide in Gaza, instead saying the situation \u201chas some aspects of a genocide.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a definition of genocide,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhether all the aspects are met. I do not know.\u201d",
      "Despite her staunchly progressive and pro-Palestinian record, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., still faced shouts of \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cyou are wrong\u201d for not denouncing defensive aid for Israel during her Seattle town hall in early August.",
      "Physical clashes but no major security breach",
      "The June assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman put lawmakers in both parties on edge. Security was top of mind for many lawmakers who opted to hold town halls.",
      "At their August events, they faced a barrage of boos and heckles, and were shouted down; Flood said he was greeted with middle fingers. But for the most part, the protests were peaceful.",
      "But there was one major clash between protesters and security at the end of a town hall hosted by freshman Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., who sparred with pro-Palestinian attendees throughout the two-hour event over his support for Israel.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Missouri congressman, and the \u2018M\u2019 doesn\u2019t stand for the Middle East,\u201d said Bell, who ousted progressive Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., in a primary last year.",
      "As the St. Louis town hall ended, officials tried to clear the room, but some refused to leave. Video posted on social media shows police and private security personnel hired by Bell shoving protesters to the ground and grabbing one by the neck and hair.",
      "The St. Louis Police Department said on X that \u201cmany\u201d of the officers involved were not members of its department, so it couldn\u2019t discuss tactics. The department said it was not aware of any arrests. Asked about the altercation, a Bell spokesperson sent NBC News a statement that did not mention it explicitly: \u201cDespite the efforts of the protestors, he found it gratifying to engage with his constituents on the most pressing issues in their lives, and he will not shy away from holding more town halls in the future.\u201d",
      "Before holding a series of town halls in Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Josh Brecheen warned on X that anyone disrupting his events would be asked to leave or removed by law enforcement.",
      "Flood, the Nebraska Republican, takes a different approach. He said he follows security guidance from the House sergeant at arms whenever he hosts public events and that he coordinated with University of Nebraska police, who sent several officers to the town hall. But he told officers that he didn\u2019t want people removed from the town hall if they were expressing their opinion.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally screaming, flipping me off. They are jumping up and down. They are standing with their back to me,\u201d Flood recounted. \u201cNone of those folks get asked to leave.\u201d",
      "GOP Rep. Barry Moore, who is running for the Senate in Alabama, was also heckled and shouted down during his Wednesday town hall in Daphne. Things got really tense 40 minutes into the event, after Moore said noncitizens are not protected by \u201cdue process.\u201d",
      "\u201cFalse! Lies! \u2026 Shame! Shame!\u201d attendees shouted at him.",
      "Without saying another word, Moore withdrew to the back of the room, then slipped out a back door.",
      "\u201cBye, Felicia!\u201d a man yelled at Moore."

    "summary": "Members of Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian government will be unable to travel to the United Nations General Assembly after Marco Rubio revoked their visas.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is barring Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas from attending the meeting of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next month where several countries including France, Canada and the U.K. are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "Abbas, along with approximately 80 other officials from his Palestinian Authority (PA), had their U.S. visas revoked or denied ahead of the meeting according to a State Department official, who accused them of undermining the prospects for peace in Gaza where Israel escalated its assault on Friday.",
      "Both the PA and and the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \u201cmust repudiate terrorism,\u201d before \u201cthey can be taken seriously as partners for peace,\u201d State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Saturday, adding that they   should abandon \u201cthe pursuit of unilateral recognition of statehood.\u201d The Trump administration \u201cdoes not reward terrorism,\u201d he said.",
      "As the host country for the United Nations, the U.S. is required under a 1947 \u201cheadquarters agreement,\u201d to grant foreign diplomats access to the U.N. but exceptions have been made by past administrations for both security and policy reasons.",
      "After the U.S. refused to issue a visa to PLO leader Yasser Arafat in 1988, The U.N. General Assembly held a meeting that year in Geneva instead of New York so he could address it.",
      "Headed by Abbas, who has not faced an election in almost two decades, the Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It has not governed in Gaza since 2007 when the Palestinian president's security forces were driven out by the Islamic militant group Hamas.",
      "In June, Abbas wrote a letter to France\u2019s president in which he condemned the Hamas attack and called on hostages taken by the militant group to be released.",
      "Pigott's comments echoed a statement from the State Department on Friday which said the PA and the PLO \u201cmust consistently repudiate terrorism,\u201d including the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, which saw 1,200 people killed and around 250 people taken hostage.",
      "It also accused PA and PLO of contributing to \u201cHamas\u2019s refusal to release its hostages, and to the breakdown of the Gaza ceasefire talks.\u201d",
      "Washington has said it can deny visas for security, extremism and foreign policy reasons. Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar welcomed the State Department\u2019s decision.",
      "But Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N. told reporters Friday that as far as he knew, \u201cthe head of our delegation is President Mahmoud Abbas, and he is coming to represent the state of Palestine and the Palestinian people in that conference.\u201d",
      "On the visa revocations, he added, \u201cWe will see exactly what it means and how it applies to any of our delegation, and we will respond accordingly.\u201d",
      "Several European foreign ministers criticized the decision ahead of a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark on Saturday. A U.N. General Assembly \u201ccannot be subject to any restrictions on access,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told reporters.",
      "France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia are each expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the assembly, a move the Trump administration has opposed. The state of Palestine is currently recognized by 147 of the U.N.\u2019s 193 member states."

    "story": [
      "After a violinist who has played with high-profile orchestras was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week, members of Utah\u2019s music community are rallying in support of his release.",
      "Donggin Shin, 37, who came to the U.S. from South Korea with his father when he was a child, was abruptly arrested at a hotel parking lot while he was on a work trip in Colorado, his attorney Adam Crayk told NBC News. He was placed in ICE detention on Aug. 18. With a hearing slated for early September, his colleagues from the Salt Lake City area are hoping to send a message to the administration and beyond that Shin, who goes by the name John, is a valued part of the community.",
      "\u201cJohn has been in this country since he was 10 years old and he was brought here by his parents. He didn\u2019t get a choice in the matter,\u201d violinist and conductor Gabriel Gordon said. \u201cHe is not somebody that is taking from the community, but is giving.\u201d",
      "A senior Department of Homeland Security official said in response to NBC News\u2019 questions about Shin, \u201cOur message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "Shin, who works a day job in telecommunications but has played with the prestigious Utah Symphony and Ballet West, is currently being held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado, according to an ICE database \u2014 more than 500 miles away from his home.",
      "According to charging documents, Shin was identified by ICE\u2019s Fugitive Operations Team, which is generally focused on apprehending immigrants who have committed serious crimes and are considered threats to national security. In Shin\u2019s case, the arrest was prompted by an old misdemeanor impaired driving offense that occurred while Shin was navigating his father\u2019s battle with brain cancer, Crayk said.",
      "\u201cWe are literally having fugitive ops and Homeland Security Investigations, which are two law enforcement agencies that focus on really terrible, terrible things, relegated now to looking for people like John,\u201d Crayk said.",
      "The senior DHS official did not elaborate on the details of Shin\u2019s arrest but noted that his history includes a DUI conviction.",
      "\u201cShin entered the U.S. on a tourist visa on September 3, 1998,\u201d the official said in the statement. \u201cThis visa required him to depart the U.S. by March 3, 1999.\u201d",
      "According to Crayk, DHS\u2019 account of Shin\u2019s immigration history omits some details. After Shin and his father entered the country on a tourist visa, his father eventually switched to a student visa, under which Shin, a dependent at the time, was also covered, the attorney said.",
      "Years later, Shin became a DACA recipient. However, due to the 2020 impaired driving conviction, Shin lost his DACA protections, leaving him without lawful status for the last four and a half years, Crayk said. Records show that Shin pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense, served his probation and the matter was resolved.",
      "On the day of his arrest, his wife, DaNae Shin, with whom he has two stepchildren, received a panicked phone call, she wrote on social media. It happened to be her birthday, she said.",
      "\u201cI got a call from John-- \u2018Honey, I don\u2019t have much time. I\u2019ve been arrested by ICE and they are sending me to a detainment center. I love you and the kids, I will be okay, please call our attorney\u2019 and then he was rushed off the phone,\u201d Shin wrote. \u201cJohn is not a criminal, he is an amazing husband, father, and person, and I will do whatever it takes to bring him back home.\u201d",
      "While Shin has long been eligible for a green card, Crayk said his family was struggling financially and marriage-based green card fees run around $2,375.",
      "\u201cAt the time he married his wife, DaNae, his father died of brain cancer and his wife lost her job,\u201d Crayk said. \u201cSo they went through extreme financial crisis, and they\u2019ve been scrimping and saving since that time.\u201d",
      "Since hearing the news, Gordon and several other musicians have been playing at the state Capitol each day, determined to continue doing so to raise awareness until Shin returns home. Gordon, a conductor and violinist for Ballet West, said he\u2019s known Shin for almost a decade and \u201cwould do anything\u201d for the fellow violinist and his family. He described Shin as a \u201ctop-shelf violinist.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got an incredible technique,\u201d said Gordon, who\u2019s also concertmaster of Chamber Orchestra Ogden. \u201cEven more than that, he takes his technique and brings his soul to it. He brings that joy of music-making to the entire community.\u201d",
      "Robert Baldwin, director of orchestras at the University of Utah, where he is also a professor, said he was shocked and angry at the news. Baldwin\u2019s friendship with Shin stretches back more than 15 years to when the violinist began his undergraduate studies at the school. Baldwin said that Shin showed grit early on.",
      "\u201cHe was not the top violinist when he arrived. He had a lot of raw talent, and he asked what he needed to do to be, for instance, in the top orchestra,\u201d Baldwin recalled. \u201cHe worked his way up. By the time he was a graduate student, he was the concertmaster, meaning the first violinist of the top orchestra.\u201d",
      "Baldwin also said that as Shin progressed, he attempted to create an inclusive environment for his fellow musicians.",
      "\u201cHe helped other students acclimate to university life, whether it was a freshman or a new graduate student,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI really like the fact that he didn\u2019t take a leadership role and just wear that as a badge and put himself on an ivory tower above everyone else.\u201d",
      "Gordon hopes Monday\u2019s performance in support of Shin conveys a clear message.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that all that we\u2019re doing is showing just how valuable he is to this community and why he belongs here,\u201d he said. \u201cHe absolutely belongs here.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A silent heart disease risk factor may explain why some women end up having heart attacks and strokes despite seeming like they are healthy, a new study suggests.",
      "The analysis of 30 years of data from more than 12,000 women revealed that inflammation was comparable to high LDL cholesterol as a heart disease risk factor, researchers reported Friday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress meeting in Madrid. The results were simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal.",
      "Measuring inflammation is not a standard part of screening in the United States and there are no outward signs that a person may have high levels.",
      "Inflammation can raise a woman\u2019s risk of a heart attack or stroke even when other risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, smoking status and high blood pressure \u2014 aren\u2019t an issue, said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Paul Ridker, a preventive cardiologist at Mass General Brigham and Women\u2019s Heart and Vascular Institute and a professor of medicine at the Harvard University Medical School.",
      "\u201cHalf of all heart attacks and strokes occur in people who do not have any major risk factors,\u201d Ridker said.",
      "Dr. Anais Hausvater, a cardiologist and co-director of the Cardio-Obstetrics Research Program at NYU Langone Health, called the study \u201cpotentially practice changing.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite a growing body of evidence that inflammation is an incredibly important cardiovascular risk factor and the recommendation that most should be screened, the vast majority of women are not being screened,\u201d said Hausvater, who was not involved with the research.",
      "An inexpensive blood test for what\u2019s known as high-sensitivity CRP can measure inflammation. Ridker said that in Europe it\u2019s already the standard of care to measure hsCRP.",
      "The new study used data from the Women\u2019s Health Study, which was launched by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in the early 1990s.",
      "At the outset, blood samples were collected from the women to measure cholesterol and hsCRP levels.",
      "Of the nearly 28,000 women who provided a baseline blood test, 12,530 had no standard modifiable risk factors for heart disease, or \u201cSMuRFs.\u201d During 30 years of follow-up, there were 973 cardiovascular events \u2014 such as a heart attack or stroke \u2014 in this group. Levels of hsCRP were significantly higher among women who experienced them.",
      "The new findings indicate that inflammation should be included in heart disease screenings, Ridker said. High inflammation can be treated with statins, but with a healthy cholesterol reading, these women would not qualify for a statin prescription.",
      "A previous clinical trial found that women who do not have the standard modifiable risk factors could benefit from treatment with statins. That trial showed that women with high inflammation but no other risk factors saw a 38% reduction in serious cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack if they received statin therapy, Ridker said.",
      "But if hsCRP isn\u2019t measured, these women won\u2019t get the lifesaving treatment they need, Ridker said. \u201cThe bottom line is that physicians will not treat what they don\u2019t measure,\u201d he said.",
      "Hausvater said that screening should be routine for all women.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool women should be offered to assess their risk,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say, based on this study, I would recommend that patients ask their physicians to check their hsCRP.\u201d",
      "Dr. Tania Ruiz, a cardiologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, agreed. \u201cThis is a very exciting study,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first large-scale study of hsCRP as a predictor of cardiovascular events in otherwise healthy women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve learned more about the role of inflammation in the formation of plaques and plaque vulnerability,\u201d Ruiz said.",
      "Women with autoimmune diseases such as lupus may be more likely to have a high hsCRP score, Ruiz said. Otherwise, without testing, there\u2019s no way to know."

    "story": [
      "On a video call, 20-year-old Daniel Jackson, the self-proclaimed president of the Free Republic of Verdis, looks the part: He is sitting at a desk with the country\u2019s flag to his right and a banner sporting the name of his country behind him.",
      "Instead of a presidential palace, he is speaking from a humble house in Dover, a port city in the south of England. And the Free Republic of Verdis, the country he claims to have founded in 2019, is nothing more than a small strip of uninhabited forest on the border between Croatia and Serbia, more than 1,000 miles away.",
      "And yet, because of a historical border dispute, Jackson, who was born in Australia, claims to be the land\u2019s rightful owner and ruler.",
      "Known as \u201cPocket 3,\u201d the strip of forest roughly the size of the Vatican was among several left unclaimed by both countries after the Croatian war of independence ended in 1995.",
      "Jackson now envisions a country that could be a draw for humanitarian aid workers.",
      "\u201cVerdis was an idea when I was about 14 but it came back, and actually, we actually properly created the state after I had turned 18,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason being is it was just an idea that initially came up with a lot of people that I know that did humanitarian work in Ukraine. And we wanted to do something that was a bit, a bit bigger than, you know, just doing aid to one country.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cWe want to be a neutral state. We want to be a hub for NGOs. We have a massive humanitarian background.\u201d",
      "Those lofty goals may be tempered by the reality of neighboring countries who don\u2019t recognize the existence of Verdis and may be hostile to its potential citizens.",
      "\u201cIn October 2023 is when we started a settlement, and a few days later Croatian authorities quickly destroyed that settlement,\u201d Jackson said, noting that he was given a permanent ban from Croatia and the other settlers were banned for three months.",
      "He added, \u201cI\u2019ve been to Verdis a lot of times before Croatian authorities invaded Verdis. We did a lot of cadastral work, a lot of surveying. We planted a flag for the first time earlier that year.\u201d",
      "Jackson was at least partially inspired by Liberland, another unclaimed pocket of land between Croatia and Serbia that in 2015 was turned into a microstate by Czech politician V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka.",
      "It is a symbolic state that offers virtual citizenship and an economy based on cryptocurrencies, but it has not been recognized by any official country, and Croatian authorities have blocked physical access to it.",
      "Jackson says that while he shares some principles with Liberland, he wants the Free Republic of Verdis to become an actual settlement whose citizens are driven by noble principles.",
      "\u201cWe have the opportunity to test, for example, new systems of governance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can allow citizens to have a bit of a fresh start. So people coming from all over the world that want to try something new basically.\u201d",
      "For now, Verdis only exists on a website where people can apply for citizenship. According to Jackson, 15,000 people have applied so far, and 400 have already been handed over physical passports and IDs. Legitimate or not, Verdisian documents have been used to cross borders.",
      "\u201cThere are instances of successful crossings but it\u2019s not something that we will promote unless that country recognizes our documents officially,\u201d Jackson chuckles.",
      "Jackson says he now lives in \u201cexile\u201d in Dover, where he goes to the socializes with friends and plays video games.",
      "Together with his minister of internal affairs and other officials he is planning to attend a protest outside the Croatian embassy in London, according to the Republic of Verdis\u2019 official website.We will also hold a general meet-and-greet at a local cafe or pub after the protest,\u201d the website says.",
      "\u201cWhile I am the president of Verdis, I still also live like any other 20-year-old,\u201d Jackson said."

    "story": [
      "Packed into a gritty, bare-bones music venue on the edge of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, on a Sunday in July, about 500 fans of Bay Area rapper LaRussell were taken to church. Except there was no pastor or choir and no pews. Instead it was a 2 p.m. show for independent artist LaRussell, spreading his own gospel through catchy dance music and clever wordplay.",
      "\u201cBrooklyn, I\u2019m ho-ome,\u201d LaRussell exclaimed with his distinctive West Coast flare.",
      "And while a midday hip-hop show may seem unusual, it reflects LaRussell\u2019s approach \u2014 doing things his way and allowing others to adapt.",
      "\u201cYou cultivate a completely different experience,\u201d LaRussell said ahead of the performance. \u201cI have every age there from 1 to 100. Granny not coming out at 10 p.m., and you don\u2019t want the little homies out at 10 p.m. \u201d",
      "The \u201cGive Me a Beat\u201d artist\u2019s playful, community-centered approach to his art \u2014 and business \u2014 has fans coming to shows again and again, paying for his music, and even bidding for his time. And the millions upon millions of streams on music platforms come without the backing of a record label.",
      "Instead, LaRussell and his small team handle everything on their own: uploading songs to streamers, booking shows that they set up and tear down, social media promotion and even selling merch at events. Emailing the rapper\u2019s management often yields a response from LaRussell himself. He said this way of operating comes from years of making something out of nothing.\u201cI wasn\u2019t independent because I didn\u2019t want to sign and I didn\u2019t like the labels,\u201d he said. \u201cI was independent because I didn\u2019t have no other option.\u201d",
      "Using a sliding scale and offer-based model, LaRussell has created a system where fans can decide what value his art has to them. Supporters can bid on items ranging from concert tickets to tour merchandise, while other artists can submit offers to collaborate on songs. Bidding for tickets to most of his shows starts at $1 and goes up from there (though donations of at least $100 are suggested). However, LaRussell and his team can counter if they don\u2019t approve. He doesn\u2019t accept less than $500 for a song feature \u2014 but because he spends no more than 15 minutes on any song he writes, the profit can add up quickly.",
      "Three hours before the Brooklyn show, LaRussell joined a freestyle rap exhibition, or cypher, on the sidewalk in front of the venue with a local podcast duo that had booked him in the weeks leading up to the concert.Fans can even buy stock in the royalties of specific songs, or bid on various experiences like wedding appearances, seminars or a game of pickleball \u2014 a game at which he swears he is hard to beat.",
      "LaRussell said he was inspired by the late rapper and fellow Californian Nipsey Hussle\u2019s \u201cProud to Pay\u201d offer-based model. In 2013, Hussle sold 1,000 physical copies of a mixtape for $100 each in less than 24 hours, effectively making $100,000 overnight. LaRussell wasn\u2019t too sure about asking fans for so much cash and instead took the opposite route.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know a bunch of people who had $100 to spend on an album, so I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to let them pay me anything,\u2019 because I got zero dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if they give me $1, I am up. It really helped me build the base and establish the infrastructure.\u201d",
      "The community he's built continues to pour back into LaRussell and his piggy bank. On Thursday, the rapper launched his own \u201cProud 2 Pay\u201d initiative where, for $1,000, supporters get a \u201cBackyard Show Experience,\u201d which includes an intimate show, unlimited access to future backyard shows, a tour of his childhood home and more. In less than 24 hours, the rapper said he sold 67 tickets.",
      "That foundation from his career\u2019s inception has evolved into a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that rivals some of the biggest musical artists of the last decade. To date, LaRussell has collaborated on songs with hip-hop titans including Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and Lil Jon, has publicly released 40 albums since 2018 and amassed more than 100 million global streams, according to Songstats, a music analytics site.",
      "And he owns all of his music and intellectual property through Good Compenny, both a label and a creative company he founded in 2016 to pursue his own art and help others around him do the same. Everything from content creation to song production and merchandise shipping can happen inside a building in his hometown of Vallejo, California, bearing the business\u2019 name, a play on seeing the value in a coin some people discard.",
      "\u201cThem pennies add up,\u201d said LaRussell.",
      "So far, LaRussell said, he\u2019s made millions of dollars off of music, something he\u2019s proud and humbled by. But he admits he has loftier goals that keep him hungry, even if his decisions invite financial and creative risks.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a different roller coaster when you\u2019re independent because you\u2019re constantly taking risks for a reward that you see in your head that may not be something that looks completely tangible yet, but you have to just go with what you feel,\u201d he said.",
      "While he\u2019s not the first indie artist to wade into mainstream success, LaRussell continues to be one of the most savvy of this era. Predecessors like KRS-One and Chance the Rapper gained international fame, while regional performers like Devine Carama of Lexington, Kentucky, who\u2019s been a full-time independent artist for the last two decades, have crafted their own paths to success.",
      "Carama points to LaRussell\u2019s ability to build a fan base \u201cthat loves and supports you \u2014 not just your music, but you.\u201d",
      "Carama, a community activist who teaches a class called \u201cLeadership & Lyricism: Hip-Hop & Community Change\u201d at the University of Kentucky, has seen the industry change time and again. From personally selling CDs from the trunk of his car in the early 2000s to the current era of streaming, Carama said the medium may change, but he believes community being at the core of the culture has not wavered.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible to be a hip-hop artist and not be connected to the community that you come from and somehow using the culture to give back,\u201d he said.",
      "For LaRussell, shows range from intimate experiences at lounges with a couple hundred people to larger performances at major venues with a few thousand. In the last year alone, he\u2019s hosted an NPR Tiny Desk Concert, performed at this year\u2019s NBA All-Star weekend and created this season\u2019s anthem for the San Francisco Giants.",
      "But, LaRussell said, none of it means anything without being able to give back to the people who support him.",
      "One family of three from California \u2014 mom, dad and teenage son \u2014  was attending its 28th LaRussell show together that afternoon in Brooklyn. They were second in line for the show, as eager, they said, as the first time they saw their favorite artist perform.",
      "\u201cIt feels great supporting people that are putting good energy out and being direct to the artist,\u201d said Noah Kahn.",
      "His wife and son nodded in agreement.",
      "Katie Kahn added, \u201cWe\u2019re part of the family now.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "After a violinist who has played with high-profile orchestras was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week, members of Utah\u2019s music community are rallying in support of his release.",
      "Donggin Shin, 37, who came to the U.S. from South Korea with his father when he was a child, was abruptly arrested at a hotel parking lot while he was on a work trip in Colorado, his attorney Adam Crayk told NBC News. He was placed in ICE detention on Aug. 18. With a hearing slated for early September, his colleagues from the Salt Lake City area are hoping to send a message to the administration and beyond that Shin, who goes by the name John, is a valued part of the community.",
      "\u201cJohn has been in this country since he was 10 years old and he was brought here by his parents. He didn\u2019t get a choice in the matter,\u201d violinist and conductor Gabriel Gordon said. \u201cHe is not somebody that is taking from the community, but is giving.\u201d",
      "A senior Department of Homeland Security official said in response to NBC News\u2019 questions about Shin, \u201cOur message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "Shin, who works a day job in telecommunications but has played with the prestigious Utah Symphony and Ballet West, is currently being held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado, according to an ICE database \u2014 more than 500 miles away from his home.",
      "According to charging documents, Shin was identified by ICE\u2019s Fugitive Operations Team, which is generally focused on apprehending immigrants who have committed serious crimes and are considered threats to national security. In Shin\u2019s case, the arrest was prompted by an old misdemeanor impaired driving offense that occurred while Shin was navigating his father\u2019s battle with brain cancer, Crayk said.",
      "\u201cWe are literally having fugitive ops and Homeland Security Investigations, which are two law enforcement agencies that focus on really terrible, terrible things, relegated now to looking for people like John,\u201d Crayk said.",
      "The senior DHS official did not elaborate on the details of Shin\u2019s arrest but noted that his history includes a DUI conviction.",
      "\u201cShin entered the U.S. on a tourist visa on September 3, 1998,\u201d the official said in the statement. \u201cThis visa required him to depart the U.S. by March 3, 1999.\u201d",
      "According to Crayk, DHS\u2019 account of Shin\u2019s immigration history omits some details. After Shin and his father entered the country on a tourist visa, his father eventually switched to a student visa, under which Shin, a dependent at the time, was also covered, the attorney said.",
      "Years later, Shin became a DACA recipient. However, due to the 2020 impaired driving conviction, Shin lost his DACA protections, leaving him without lawful status for the last four and a half years, Crayk said. Records show that Shin pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense, served his probation and the matter was resolved.",
      "On the day of his arrest, his wife, DaNae Shin, with whom he has two stepchildren, received a panicked phone call, she wrote on social media. It happened to be her birthday, she said.",
      "\u201cI got a call from John-- \u2018Honey, I don\u2019t have much time. I\u2019ve been arrested by ICE and they are sending me to a detainment center. I love you and the kids, I will be okay, please call our attorney\u2019 and then he was rushed off the phone,\u201d Shin wrote. \u201cJohn is not a criminal, he is an amazing husband, father, and person, and I will do whatever it takes to bring him back home.\u201d",
      "While Shin has long been eligible for a green card, Crayk said his family was struggling financially and marriage-based green card fees run around $2,375.",
      "\u201cAt the time he married his wife, DaNae, his father died of brain cancer and his wife lost her job,\u201d Crayk said. \u201cSo they went through extreme financial crisis, and they\u2019ve been scrimping and saving since that time.\u201d",
      "Since hearing the news, Gordon and several other musicians have been playing at the state Capitol each day, determined to continue doing so to raise awareness until Shin returns home. Gordon, a conductor and violinist for Ballet West, said he\u2019s known Shin for almost a decade and \u201cwould do anything\u201d for the fellow violinist and his family. He described Shin as a \u201ctop-shelf violinist.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got an incredible technique,\u201d said Gordon, who\u2019s also concertmaster of Chamber Orchestra Ogden. \u201cEven more than that, he takes his technique and brings his soul to it. He brings that joy of music-making to the entire community.\u201d",
      "Robert Baldwin, director of orchestras at the University of Utah, where he is also a professor, said he was shocked and angry at the news. Baldwin\u2019s friendship with Shin stretches back more than 15 years to when the violinist began his undergraduate studies at the school. Baldwin said that Shin showed grit early on.",
      "\u201cHe was not the top violinist when he arrived. He had a lot of raw talent, and he asked what he needed to do to be, for instance, in the top orchestra,\u201d Baldwin recalled. \u201cHe worked his way up. By the time he was a graduate student, he was the concertmaster, meaning the first violinist of the top orchestra.\u201d",
      "Baldwin also said that as Shin progressed, he attempted to create an inclusive environment for his fellow musicians.",
      "\u201cHe helped other students acclimate to university life, whether it was a freshman or a new graduate student,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cI really like the fact that he didn\u2019t take a leadership role and just wear that as a badge and put himself on an ivory tower above everyone else.\u201d",
      "Gordon hopes Monday\u2019s performance in support of Shin conveys a clear message.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that all that we\u2019re doing is showing just how valuable he is to this community and why he belongs here,\u201d he said. \u201cHe absolutely belongs here.\u201d"

    "summary": "Artists and activists are telling the stories of women and mothers who've died from high-risk pregnancies, and push for changes to the recently passed penal code that keeps the ban in place.",
    "story": [
      "With a birthday cake in hand, well-known Dominican Republic comedian Carlos S\u00e1nchez recounted in an Instagram post how 25-year-old Winifer N\u00fa\u00f1ez Beato died in 2021 after doctors on the island refused to end her high-risk pregnancy because of the country\u2019s total abortion ban.",
      "N\u00fa\u00f1ez Beato left behind a husband and a young daughter. In the video, S\u00e1nchez said the cake is not for his birthday, but rather to mark another year where he\u2019s asking for women not to die because of a law that stops doctors from saving their lives.",
      "S\u00e1nchez told NBC News he felt compelled to use his platform to raise awareness because \u201cit\u2019s a barbarity that in this day and age a mother has to put her life at risk over a risky pregnancy that could be ended but the law prohibits doctors to do so.\u201d",
      "S\u00e1nchez is among many artists and activists in the Dominican Republic taking part in a social media campaign to push for amending a recently passed penal code that maintains a complete ban on abortion. Many artists have used their platforms to tell the stories of Dominican women who have lost their lives to pregnancy-related conditions.",
      "On Instagram, singer and actress Techy Fatule tells the story of Damaris Mejia, who went to three different hospitals when she started feeling ill and had a high fever. According to Fatule, medical personnel didn\u2019t know what to do with Mejia\u2019s high-risk pregnancy. She was sent home with painkillers and died that night. Fatule says doctors couldn\u2019t save her because of the ban, and ends with words, \u201cLife is full of exceptions.\u201d",
      "The Dominican Republic is a conservative country that features the Bible on its flag. The country signed a concordat, or agreement, with the Vatican in 1954 making Catholicism the state religion, though the constitution allows freedom of worship.",
      "The country\u2019s Catholic Church backs the abortion ban, as well as evangelical groups. But Alianza Cristiana Dominicana, a group formed in 2017 by women of different Christian denominations, is pushing for the penal code to include what are known in the region as the \u201ctres causales,\u201d or three causes or circumstances where ending pregnancies should be allowed: when the woman\u2019s life is at risk, in the case of rape or incest, and when fetal malformations are incompatible with life. The \u201ctres causales\u201d are used in other countries throughout Latin America that have eased total bans on abortion.",
      "Alianza Cristiana Dominicana has partnered with the artists to share the stories.",
      "So far this year, there have been 100 documented maternal deaths in the Dominican Republic. Natalia M\u00e1rmol, of the Coalition for Women\u2019s Lives and Rights, believes those lives could have been saved if abortions were legal.",
      "\u201cThis is a fight to guarantee minimum protection for life, health and dignity for girls and women,\u201d said M\u00e1rmol. \u201cWe are asking for minimal protections, so women don\u2019t die on a hospital bed. So a 13- or 15-year-old girl is not obliged to continue with a pregnancy that is the product of a rape. And so a woman can decide when a pregnancy is not viable.\u201d",
      "The Dominican Republic\u2019s previous penal code had been in place since 1884, and efforts to reform it failed for decades. The new penal code was approved by legislators and signed into law by President Luis Abinader.",
      "Abinader had previously expressed support for making exceptions to the abortion ban, but after winning re-election he didn\u2019t push for changes.",
      "After the vote, Abinader said the penal code, which covers many types of crime, \u201cis not the ideal but it\u2019s the best possible, since among other things, it substitutes legislation that dates back to 1884.\u201d",
      "M\u00e1rmol said the new penal code does include points that the group advocated for, like the classification of femicide, the intentional killing of a woman or girl, as well as an increase in the severity of punishment for sexual assault.",
      "She said the new penal code does not go into effect until August 2026 and there is time to tweak the law to include the three exceptions.",
      "The Coalition for the Life and Rights of Women and other groups have pushed for years to have the three exceptions included, even erecting a camp in 2021 in front of the National Palace to pressure parliament.",
      "In the Dominican Republic, women face up to two years in prison for having an abortion and doctors and midwives can receive five to 20 years for terminating a pregnancy.",
      "Four other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean maintain a total prohibition on abortion, including Haiti, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Most of Latin America and the Caribbean allows abortion in limited cases.",
      "Caribbean-pop singer and songwriter Isabel de Dios said she has been active in the feminist movement throughout her adulthood, often taking part in protests. Her first song, called \u201cColonizado,\u201d or \u201cColonized,\u201d talks about how society expects people to stay within established roles and turns a blind eye to many situations.",
      "She called the penal code \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cdictatorial\u201d and \u201cfeudal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat kind of society are we constructing?\u201d she said."

      "Abbas, along with approximately 80 other officials from his Palestinian Authority (PA), had their U.S. visas revoked or denied ahead of the meeting according to a State Department official, who accused them of undermining the prospects for peace in Gaza where Israel escalated its assault on Friday.",
      "Both the PA and and the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \u201cmust repudiate terrorism,\u201d before \u201cthey can be taken seriously as partners for peace,\u201d State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Saturday, adding that they   should abandon \u201cthe pursuit of unilateral recognition of statehood.\u201d The Trump administration \u201cdoes not reward terrorism,\u201d he said.",
      "As the host country for the United Nations, the U.S. is required under a 1947 \u201cheadquarters agreement,\u201d to grant foreign diplomats access to the U.N. but exceptions have been made by past administrations for both security and policy reasons.",
      "After the U.S. refused to issue a visa to PLO leader Yasser Arafat in 1988, The U.N. General Assembly held a meeting that year in Geneva instead of New York so he could address it.",
      "Headed by Abbas, who has not faced an election in almost two decades, the Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It has not governed in Gaza since 2007 when the Palestinian president's security forces were driven out by the Islamic militant group Hamas.",
      "In June, Abbas wrote a letter to France\u2019s president in which he condemned the Hamas attack and called on hostages taken by the militant group to be released.",
      "Pigott's comments echoed a statement from the State Department on Friday which said the PA and the PLO \u201cmust consistently repudiate terrorism,\u201d including the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, which saw 1,200 people killed and around 250 people taken hostage.",
      "It also accused PA and PLO of contributing to \u201cHamas\u2019s refusal to release its hostages, and to the breakdown of the Gaza ceasefire talks.\u201d",
      "Washington has said it can deny visas for security, extremism and foreign policy reasons. Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar welcomed the State Department\u2019s decision.",
      "But Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the U.N. told reporters Friday that as far as he knew, \u201cthe head of our delegation is President Mahmoud Abbas, and he is coming to represent the state of Palestine and the Palestinian people in that conference.\u201d",
      "On the visa revocations, he added, \u201cWe will see exactly what it means and how it applies to any of our delegation, and we will respond accordingly.\u201d",
      "Several European foreign ministers criticized the decision ahead of a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark on Saturday. A U.N. General Assembly \u201ccannot be subject to any restrictions on access,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told reporters.",
      "France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia are each expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the assembly, a move the Trump administration has opposed. The state of Palestine is currently recognized by 147 of the U.N.\u2019s 193 member states."

      "\u201cCanadians were already concerned over their personal finances, but they\u2019ve taken the rhetoric and policy announcements from the U.S. administration very personally,\u201d said Amir Eylon, president and CEO of market research firm Longwoods International, which has been regularly surveying Canadian consumers.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, things have gone from bad to worse,\u201d he added.",
      "A whopping 80% of Canadian travelers whose travel decisions are being influenced by U.S. policy and politics say U.S. tariffs and economic policy are the major negative influence. Seventy-one percent say political statements by U.S. leaders are a key negative factor, up from 64% in April, according to Longwoods International\u2019s mid-July survey.",
      "Instead of visiting the United States, where AAA says Labor Day weekend travelers will be enjoying lower year-over-year prices for everything from gas, hotels and flights to car rental costs, disgruntled Canadians are planning to travel within their own country or book flights to other nations.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re choosing destinations such as Mexico, the Caribbean and Western Europe,\u201d Eylon said.",
      "It is not just Canadians who are staying away.",
      "Geopolitical and policy-related concerns have also led to a decrease in visitors from Western Europe and Asia, experts say. Overseas arrivals to the U.S. dropped three months in a row, including a 3.1% drop in July, bringing the year-to-date decline to 1.6%, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "Overall, the \u201csentiment drag has proven severe,\u201d the group said in a data update released last week. In December, it had forecast an approximate 9% increase in overall international arrivals to the United States for 2025. It now expects an 8.2% decline.",
      "Overseas visitor numbers throughout the United States may dip even further due to the $250 visa integrity fee set to go into effect on Oct. 1. The new charge would be layered on top of other visa fees and apply to most anyone applying for a nonimmigrant visa for travel to the United States, including visitors from China, Mexico and Brazil.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association calls it \u201ca misguided junk fee\u201d that will hike the upfront costs of visiting the U.S. by 130% just as the cities across the country already reeling from the loss of international visitors are preparing for major global events such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup, America\u2019s 250th birthday and the 2028 Summer Olympics.",
      "The fee, part of Trump's signature tax and spending law, requires coordination across agencies before it's implemented, said a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, who defended the measure. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill provides the necessary policies and resources to restore to our nation\u2019s immigration system.\"",
      "Autumn of discontent",

      "In response, the group is planning winter campaigns and media missions to Mexico, the United Kingdom and, most notably, Canada. The group plans to host an event in Toronto in September, O\u2019Donnell said.",
      "In Rochester, New York, 90 minutes from the Canadian-U.S. border, 12% to 15% of visitors have traditionally come from Canada.",

      "Rochester\u2019s tourist attractions include the George Eastman Museum, the Strong National Museum of Play and the National Susan B. Anthony Museum & House. The city\u2019s summer and fall tourism promotion plans have shifted from traditional tourism marketing messages to a \u201csofter\u201d approach, Laber Pulvino said, including a \u201cDear Canada\u201d campaign launched earlier this summer.",
      "\u201cIt is essentially a love letter to our neighbors to the north. Our message is simple: When you\u2019re ready, we will be here,\u201d she said.",
      "Canadians made 20.4 million visits to the United States in 2024. This year, the steep pullback of Canadian visitors is expected to most negatively affect northern cities such as Seattle; Portland, Oregon; and Detroit. In those cities, overall international visitors are expected to decline this year by about 27%, 18% and 17%, respectively, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\u201cWe typically like to be at the top of lists, but not this one,\u201d Michael Woody, chief strategy officer for Visit Seattle, said.",
      "Woody said the projected dip is \u201ccertainly concerning\u201d for Seattle. But, he added, Seattle is having a great summer thanks to an uptick in domestic visitors, summer concerts by Lady Gaga and several other headliners, and a cruise season that the Port of Seattle estimates is bringing about 1.9 million passengers to the city.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to when Canadian visitor numbers bound back, but that\u2019s driven by so many factors that we don\u2019t have any control over,\u201d he said.",
      "In Portland, tourism has remained flat compared with last summer, largely due to a decline in Canadian visitors, said Jackie Hagan, director of communications for Travel Portland. But, heading into fall, Hagan said the tourism agency is taking a wait-and-see approach to reaching out to Canadian visitors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to acknowledge and respect their current decisions not to travel to the U.S., while also expressing that we look forward to their return when the time feels right,\u201d she said.",
      "How's it going in Florida?",
      "Not all states and cities are wringing hands over international visitor statistics.",
      "Recently released data from Visit Florida Research estimates that 34.4 million visitors traveled to the Sunshine State in the second quarter of 2025, up 5% over the same period in 2024. That includes 640,000 Canadians \u2014 down 20% year over year \u2014 and 2.3 million overseas visitors, up 11.4% year over year.",
      "In a statement celebrating the uptick in overall visits, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said, \u201cPeople from all over the world come to the Free State of Florida to take advantage of our top-tier attractions, great weather, and our commitment to public safety.\u201d",
      "Greg Fisher, founder and CEO of Destin, Florida-based tour- and activity-booking site TripShock, is surprised that visitor numbers are up.",
      "The tour operators his company works with report that business is either flat or down so far in 2025, he said. \u201cMany of us in Florida are left wondering where these visitors are actually going and what they\u2019re spending their money on,\u201d he said.",
      "Perhaps they are going to the Palm Beaches. There, international visitation for the first half of 2025 is up 2.56% year over year, according to Milton Segarra, CEO of tourism marketing organization Discover the Palm Beaches.",
      "While Canadian visitors to the area dipped 4.4% year over year, international markets such as Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany and Colombia saw growth, he said.",

At 25 town halls across the country that were viewed or attended by NBC News this summer, voters pressured Democrats to deploy more aggressive tactics as they battle Trump and took them to task over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.",

Responding to other questions, Flood said one way to bring down the cost of health insurance was to \u201cnot have as many people on Medicaid.\u201d He also told the crowd the country \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d Medicare for All.",

That would be an uphill fight, however, given how difficult it was for Republicans to pass the Trump legislation on a party-line basis.",
      "\u201cOK, so this bill is not going to be the be all, end all. \u2026 It\u2019s not the end of the discussion. It\u2019s not the end of the legislation,\u201d LaMalfa said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s bulls---!\u201d one attendee shot back.",
      "Democrats feel the heat on the party\u2019s direction after Trump\u2019s win",
      "Democratic lawmakers were also pressed about the direction of their party at several town halls. Attendees asked how Democrats will combat Trump\u2019s agenda and turn the party\u2019s trajectory around following the 2024 presidential election loss.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no one running to save us,\u201d Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., said of the Democratic Party to a crowd in Steamboat Springs. \u201cThere is no panacea. There\u2019s no master plan. It is about doing the work, developing and building coalitions.\u201d",
      "At several town halls, fellow Colorado Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Sen. Michael Bennet said that the Democratic Party \u201cshould have never lost\u201d the 2024 presidential election and called Trump\u2019s victory \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d",
      "Bennet added that Democrats must run on more than just opposition to Trump.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not doing anything, basically, that he didn\u2019t promise to do when he was running for office, which is part of the problem, when he built a majority coalition to get elected president and we couldn\u2019t stop it. Knowing what we know about it sitting in this room \u2026 we have to ask ourselves, \u2018Why are we not able to build a governing coalition to beat them either time?\u2019\u201d Bennet said.",
      "In Michigan, before an audience of mostly white seniors in a Republican district represented by Rep. Bill Huizenga, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., warned that young people are \u201cdisillusioned\u201d and feel \u201cleft out\u201d of Democratic politics. She emphasized that Democrats want to see a \u201cnew generation of leaders,\u201d pointing to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City.",
      "\u201c[Democrats] are willing to take someone new, or that they may not know a ton about, rather than the kind of warmed-over leftovers, right? And so, I think, to me, that signal couldn\u2019t be sent any clearer,\u201d she said.",
      "A Dem town hall is shut down over Gaza crisis",
      "The political handling of the ongoing war in Gaza continues to haunt Democrats, as constituents across the country continuously interrupted town halls to voice their anger at U.S. politicians for not doing more \u2014 and in one case, shut down the town hall.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., canceled his town hall after nine pro-Palestinian protesters \u201ctook over the stage, shouting and disrupting\u201d the ongoing event, according to the Renton Police Department. Smith posted on X that the behavior displayed by the protesters was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d calling it a \u201ccoordinated\u201d effort \u201cto shut down public dialogue\u201d and alleging that one of his staff was \u201cwas physically assaulted during the chaos.\u201d",
      "Three protesters at Smith\u2019s event were later arrested on trespassing charges, police said.",
      "A day later in Rhode Island, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., held a joint, two-hour town hall where they faced consistent disruptions and questions about their stances on Israel and Gaza.",
      "In July, Reed voted in favor of a resolution introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to prohibit the sale of certain assault rifles to Israel, but he voted against a second Sanders resolution that applied to bomb sales, which attendees reminded Reed of \u2014 through shouts of \u201cbut not bombs\u201d when the Rhode Island senator highlighted his vote.",
      "Magaziner didn\u2019t say how he would vote if a bill banning arms to Israel reached the House floor. Instead, he told the heated audience that he would \u201cjudge it through the lens of, how do we end the atrocities? What is the most effective way to do that?\u201d \u2014 an answer that did not seem to satisfy the crowd.",
      "Rep. Steven Cohen, D-Tenn., criticized Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a Memphis town hall, mentioning that he did not attend Netanyahu\u2019s addresses to Congress in 2015 or 2024, and adding he has \u201cno respect\u201d for the Israeli leader.",
      "However, Cohen faced boos when he declined to say outright that there is a genocide in Gaza, instead saying the situation \u201chas some aspects of a genocide.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a definition of genocide,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWhether all the aspects are met. I do not know.\u201d",
      "Despite her staunchly progressive and pro-Palestinian record, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., still faced shouts of \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cyou are wrong\u201d for not denouncing defensive aid for Israel during her Seattle town hall in early August.",
      "Physical clashes but no major security breach",
      "The June assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman put lawmakers in both parties on edge. Security was top of mind for many lawmakers who opted to hold town halls.",
      "At their August events, they faced a barrage of boos and heckles, and were shouted down; Flood said he was greeted with middle fingers. But for the most part, the protests were peaceful.",
      "But there was one major clash between protesters and security at the end of a town hall hosted by freshman Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., who sparred with pro-Palestinian attendees throughout the two-hour event over his support for Israel.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Missouri congressman, and the \u2018M\u2019 doesn\u2019t stand for the Middle East,\u201d said Bell, who ousted progressive Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., in a primary last year.",
      "As the St. Louis town hall ended, officials tried to clear the room, but some refused to leave. Video posted on social media shows police and private security personnel hired by Bell shoving protesters to the ground and grabbing one by the neck and hair.",
      "The St. Louis Police Department said on X that \u201cmany\u201d of the officers involved were not members of its department, so it couldn\u2019t discuss tactics. The department said it was not aware of any arrests. Asked about the altercation, a Bell spokesperson sent NBC News a statement that did not mention it explicitly: \u201cDespite the efforts of the protestors, he found it gratifying to engage with his constituents on the most pressing issues in their lives, and he will not shy away from holding more town halls in the future.\u201d",
      "Before holding a series of town halls in Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Josh Brecheen warned on X that anyone disrupting his events would be asked to leave or removed by law enforcement.",
      "Flood, the Nebraska Republican, takes a different approach. He said he follows security guidance from the House sergeant at arms whenever he hosts public events and that he coordinated with University of Nebraska police, who sent several officers to the town hall. But he told officers that he didn\u2019t want people removed from the town hall if they were expressing their opinion.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally screaming, flipping me off. They are jumping up and down. They are standing with their back to me,\u201d Flood recounted. \u201cNone of those folks get asked to leave.\u201d",
      "GOP Rep. Barry Moore, who is running for the Senate in Alabama, was also heckled and shouted down during his Wednesday town hall in Daphne. Things got really tense 40 minutes into the event, after Moore said noncitizens are not protected by \u201cdue process.\u201d",
      "\u201cFalse! Lies! \u2026 Shame! Shame!\u201d attendees shouted at him.",
      "Without saying another word, Moore withdrew to the back of the room, then slipped out a back door.",
      "\u201cBye, Felicia!\u201d a man yelled at Moore."

    "story": [
      "A silent heart disease risk factor may explain why some women end up having heart attacks and strokes despite seeming like they are healthy, a new study suggests.",
      "The analysis of 30 years of data from more than 12,000 women revealed that inflammation was comparable to high LDL cholesterol as a heart disease risk factor, researchers reported Friday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress meeting in Madrid. The results were simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal.",
      "Measuring inflammation is not a standard part of screening in the United States and there are no outward signs that a person may have high levels.",
      "Inflammation can raise a woman\u2019s risk of a heart attack or stroke even when other risk factors \u2014 such as high cholesterol, smoking status and high blood pressure \u2014 aren\u2019t an issue, said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Paul Ridker, a preventive cardiologist at Mass General Brigham and Women\u2019s Heart and Vascular Institute and a professor of medicine at the Harvard University Medical School.",
      "\u201cHalf of all heart attacks and strokes occur in people who do not have any major risk factors,\u201d Ridker said.",
      "Dr. Anais Hausvater, a cardiologist and co-director of the Cardio-Obstetrics Research Program at NYU Langone Health, called the study \u201cpotentially practice changing.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite a growing body of evidence that inflammation is an incredibly important cardiovascular risk factor and the recommendation that most should be screened, the vast majority of women are not being screened,\u201d said Hausvater, who was not involved with the research.",
      "An inexpensive blood test for what\u2019s known as high-sensitivity CRP can measure inflammation. Ridker said that in Europe it\u2019s already the standard of care to measure hsCRP.",
      "The new study used data from the Women\u2019s Health Study, which was launched by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute in the early 1990s.",
      "At the outset, blood samples were collected from the women to measure cholesterol and hsCRP levels.",
      "Of the nearly 28,000 women who provided a baseline blood test, 12,530 had no standard modifiable risk factors for heart disease, or \u201cSMuRFs.\u201d During 30 years of follow-up, there were 973 cardiovascular events \u2014 such as a heart attack or stroke \u2014 in this group. Levels of hsCRP were significantly higher among women who experienced them.",
      "The new findings indicate that inflammation should be included in heart disease screenings, Ridker said. High inflammation can be treated with statins, but with a healthy cholesterol reading, these women would not qualify for a statin prescription.",
      "A previous clinical trial found that women who do not have the standard modifiable risk factors could benefit from treatment with statins. That trial showed that women with high inflammation but no other risk factors saw a 38% reduction in serious cardiovascular events such as stroke and heart attack if they received statin therapy, Ridker said.",
      "But if hsCRP isn\u2019t measured, these women won\u2019t get the lifesaving treatment they need, Ridker said. \u201cThe bottom line is that physicians will not treat what they don\u2019t measure,\u201d he said.",
      "Hausvater said that screening should be routine for all women.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool women should be offered to assess their risk,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say, based on this study, I would recommend that patients ask their physicians to check their hsCRP.\u201d",
      "Dr. Tania Ruiz, a cardiologist and an assistant professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, agreed. \u201cThis is a very exciting study,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first large-scale study of hsCRP as a predictor of cardiovascular events in otherwise healthy women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn recent years, we\u2019ve learned more about the role of inflammation in the formation of plaques and plaque vulnerability,\u201d Ruiz said.",
      "Women with autoimmune diseases such as lupus may be more likely to have a high hsCRP score, Ruiz said. Otherwise, without testing, there\u2019s no way to know."

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi fired a Justice Department employee  on Friday accused of flipping off National Guard members deployed to Washington D.C. as part of President Donald Trump's effort to mitigate crime in the city, a Justice Department official confirmed.",
      "According to a memo sent by Bondi, the veracity of which was confirmed by the DOJ, the employee, Elizabeth Baxter, worked as a paralegal specialist in the department's Environment and Natural Resources Division.",
      "The New York Post was first to report Baxter\u2019s termination.",
      "\u201cBased on your inappropriate conduct towards National Guard service members, your employment with the Department of Justice is hereby terminated, and you are removed from federal service effective immediately,\u201d Bondi wrote in the memo, as confirmed by the Justice Department.",
      "A Justice Department official told NBC News that Baxter was seen and heard using the vulgar gesture and shouting to Guard members on multiple occasions.",
      "The incidents allegedly occurred several times during the last two weeks, though NBC News has not independently confirmed the accusations.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department, Gates McGavick, lauded the termination on Friday, writing in a post on X, \u201cif you don\u2019t support law enforcement, [Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s] DOJ might not be a good fit.\u201d",
      "The termination marks the second time this month Bondi has terminated a Justice Department employee for conduct she's deemed inappropriate toward law enforcement personnel.",
      "Weeks ago, Bondi fired a department paralegal after he was caught on camera throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent outside of a popular nightlife area in D.C. She wrote at the time, \"you will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\"",
      "Bondi initially sought to secure felony charges against that employee, Sean Dunn, but a grand jury declined to return an indictment, a signal that local residents did not identify probable cause to back that charge. U.S. District Attorney Jeanine Pirro instead charged Dunn with misdemeanor assault.",
      "Trump has consistently touted his effort to mitigate crime in D.C., which was already declining, as incredibly successful, pointing to further decreases this month in acts like carjackings. But the effort has faced mounting criticism from Democratic lawmakers and protest from D.C. residents, many of whom have characterized Trump's operation as overblown, a scare tactic and racially motivated."

    "summary": "Read on for an ending explainer for Netflix's \"Thursday Murder Club\" \u2013 including everyone who dies and who is the killer.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for the end of \"Thursday Murder Club.\"",
      "In \"Thursday Murder Club,\" a Netflix movie based on Richard Osman's novel of the same name, four residents in the Coopers Chase retirement home have a hobby of trying to solve cold cases. Then, they find themselves in the middle of an active investigation.",
      "At the start of the film, they\u2019re faced with two conundrums: A case from the 1970s in which a woman was stabbed and fell out of a window; and the fact that Ian, the man who owns the land the home is built on, is going through a nasty divorce and has to sell \u2014 no matter who he mows down in the process.",
      "The members of the Club include Helen Mirren (as Elizabeth), Pierce Brosnan (as Ron), Ben Kingsley (as Ibrahim), Celia Imrie (as Joyce) and, from her bed in a coma, Susan Kirby as Penny, the former policewoman who helped her friends (now members) get old case logs to solve.",
      "On top of that we\u2019ve got familiar, most-welcome faces in Richard E. Grant (Bobby), David Tennant (Ian), Tom Ellis (Jason), and Jonathan Pryce (Stephen), all of whom turn up playing various dubious characters.",
      "Naomi Ackie (Donna) is the policewoman who\u2019s stuck serving tea to her co-workers until the Club tricks the force into putting her on Tony\u2019s murder investigation.",
      "Beyond the central mystery, there are side stories.",
      "Elizabeth has a mysterious background (turns out she worked for MI6) and a beloved husband (Pryce) with dementia. Ron, a former union organizer, has a famous son whose star is fading. Ibrahim lives meticulously but never felt he fit in anywhere. Joyce\u2019s hard-driving hedge fund daughter who turns out to be an unexpected ally. Elizabeth makes two newfound friends in Donna and Ian\u2019s assistant Bogdan (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), one of which turns out to not be as much of a friend as she\u2019d imagined.",
      "Read on for a rundown of what happens.",
      "Who Dies and Who Are the Killers in \u2018Thursday Murder Club\u2019?",
      "The story really picks up when the murders start. Ian\u2019s partner Tony (Geoff Bell) turns up dead after an argument with Ian \u2014 he won\u2019t sell his portion of the property, since his dear aunt lives in the home. Then, Ian himself also keels over.",
      "What might surprise viewers is to find out there\u2019s a link among all of these players to the cold case the Club has been trying to solve \u2014 one that involves a long-missing third partner (and crime lord) in the home, who has full control over what happens to the home after Tony and Ian snuff it.",
      "In the end, after a lot of tea and cake, fooling the police, Club trickery and a sudden buyer who turns up to purchase the property and save it, here\u2019s whodunit for all four murders. Yep, all four.",
      "Tony is done in by Bogdan, who swears he didn\u2019t mean to do it. Bogdan is an illegal Polish worker in the UK and Tony wouldn\u2019t give him back his passport.",
      "The cold case's solution also relates to the residents of Coopers Chase.",
      "Peter, Angela\u2019s boyfriend at the time, killed his girlfriend. Early on we learn that he probably was guilty all along \u2014 but was considered \u201cone of the boys\u201d by the police at the time and allowed to disappear.",
      "Well, not all of \u201cthe boys\u201d agreed with that \u2014 Penny, who was low person at the station at the time, was sure Peter had killed Angela, and tired of seeing so many abusers get off, she killed him herself. Her husband John kept this a secret for decades.",
      "When Ian decided to start digging up the church and gravesite ahead of selling off the land (and repurposing the home as an events location), John knew he\u2019d find the bones of Mercer, which he and Penny had hidden in the graveyard.",
      "He worried his wife would be implicated after all these years, and took out Ian with a needle full of fentanyl. Once John confesses, the rest of the Club leave him for a last moment with his comatose wife, knowing he will use another fentanyl needle to let her go to a peaceful rest (because once he\u2019s jailed, he can\u2019t be there for her).",
      "Is Coopers Chase saved?",
      "It almost certainly is! Elizabeth suggests that Joyce\u2019s financially-focused daughter Joanna (Ingrid Oliver) should buy the place, an offer Joanna finds \u201cintriguing.\u201d And since Coopers Chase appears in Osman\u2019s sequels, it\u2019s safe to say this was only an attempted murder.",
      "As of now, Netflix hasn\u2019t confirmed that they plan to make movies of the rest of Osman\u2019s books, but we already know we\u2019re ready to return to the scenes of the crimes."

      "\"To me, it's the most unselfish thing you could do, to be a parent. It's not about you at all. It's about what you can give to support this child growing into adulthood. And so it doesn't matter if it's a baby or a toddler or a teenager, for that matter,\" she said. \"As long as they get to feel like they have a mother, they have a home, they have a family and somebody who's there for them.\""

      "Warning: This story contains spoilers from \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d book and television series.",
      "You won\u2019t find a bigger fan of \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d than its creator, Rebecca Cutter. The self-professed \u201cMargo truther\u201d is basking in \u201cincredible gratitude\u201d after such massive fan reaction to the Netflix hit, which continues to be the most-watched streaming original show this month.",
      "The series, originally made for Starz before finding its home at Netflix, has been a mainstay in the streamer\u2019s Top 10 list in the U.S. since its July release. It has become the subject of multiple group chats and fan edits on social media, and a new ship has set sail as a result of the eight-episode season: Margo (Malin \u00c5kerman) and Sophie (Brittany Snow). The Instagram account for \u201cThe Hunting Wives\u201d even posted a callout for viewers to cast their vote for what their couple name should be.",
      "\u201cI had a lot of confidence in what the show was,\u201d Cutter tells TODAY.com, adding if Netflix could bring in the viewership, \u201cI know I can keep them watching the show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI started to let myself be hopeful,\u201d she continues, \u201cbut I still could have never predicted the wide range of people that seem to love the show. That\u2019s shocking to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Hunting Wives,\u201d which is an adaptation of author May Cobb\u2019s novel, follows Sophie O\u2019Neil and her husband, Graham O\u2019Neil (Evan Jonigkeit), as they move with their son from the Northeast to a small town in east Texas. She falls in with a group of Southern female socialites, which includes queen bee Margo Banks, who happens to be married to Graham\u2019s hotshot new boss, Jed Banks (Dermot Mulroney), an aspiring politician. The group\u2019s idea of a good time includes going boar hunting, a lot of drinking and for some, even hooking up with one another. It doesn\u2019t take long for Sophie to fall under Margo\u2019s spell, and the two meet up for secret romantic rendezvouses. At the same time, they\u2019re grappling with the latest drama to hit the small town: the murder of teenager Abby Jackson.",
      "In twists that deviate from the book, Margo ends up being Abby\u2019s killer \u2014 not Jill (Katie Lowes), one of the moms in the girls group whose 18-year-old son, Brad, is also secretly hooking up with Margo. And, Margo does not die in the TV adaptation, but she does at the end of the book.",
      "Cutter says she knew \u201cwell before\u201d \u00c5kerman was cast as Margo that she wanted Margo as the killer in the show.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the first things when I read the book that I knew would be one of the big changes,\u201d she explains. \u201cI knew I wanted her to do it, and I knew I wanted her to stay alive.\u201d",
      "She also crafted a grittier personal backstory for her Margo, which includes a complicated relationship with brother Kyle. Cutter says her \u201cmain intention\u201d with the changes she made was to \u201cgive everybody more sort of character work to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI also just wanted to open up a different part of Texas,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cIt is fun to watch rich people, but it\u2019s also interesting to open up a different world and to have a real divide of the classes.\u201d",
      "She adds that she loves the scene of Sophie showing up at a trailer park to visit a naked Kyle during his \u201cmeth bender.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt opens up the world and opens up plot possibilities,\u201d she says.",
      "After reading the book, Cutter traveled to Longview, Texas, about two hours east of Dallas, to do research, and not only met Cobb, but Cobb's high school best friend.",
      "\u201cWithin 10 minutes, it was totally the \u2018I love you\u2019 scene (in the show with Margo and Sophie),\u201d she says.",
      "She says they went on a three-day trip and shot guns, ate barbecue and went to honky-tonks.",
      "\u201cIt was just a blast, and we talk, like, three times a week now,\u201d Cutter says.",
      "Cobb previously told TODAY.com she feels that Cutter \u201ctook the spirit of the book, of these rowdy, sassy \u2014 to put it mildly \u2014 Texas women, and just turned it up to an 11.\u201d",
      "She added that Cutter made the show \u201ceven more unapologetic and juicy and bonkers than the book.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally blowing out the different storylines and adding in some new characters and giving existing characters different backstories,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cIt's escapist fun at a time when I feel like people are really looking for that.\u201d",
      "About That Margo, Sophie, Abby Fan Theory",
      "When Margo and Sophie first meet at an NRA party at Margo and Jed's house, Sophie offers Margo a Xanax. Later on, Sophie and Margo again take Sophie's Xanax before embarking on a blackout bender the night Abby is murdered.",
      "Cutter says she didn\u2019t really think of the Xanax connection as an Easter egg but more of a plot device for the blackout and to \u201cvery specifically\u201d establish Sophie\u2019s state of mind.",
      "\u201cI try and always be as character-motivated as possible and not so much for foreshadowing, but I\u2019m glad it worked out,\u201d she says.",
      "What could possibly be foreshadowing, however, is the boar hunting outing that the wives embark on. Sophie, new to shooting, takes down a boar \u2014 but doesn\u2019t kill it. Callie (Jaime Ray Newman), who also happens to be the sheriff\u2019s wife, delivers the fatal shot to put the boar out of its misery.",
      "As the series progresses, Sophie becomes the prime suspect in Abby\u2019s murder because her gun is the one used to kill Abby, and surveillance footage in the woods shows Abby and Sophie interacting the night Abby was killed. The show actually begins with a scene of a wounded woman, who viewers later learn is Abby, running in the woods shouting for help while she's being shot at. Sophie can\u2019t remember the events of the night because she was blacked out. After various other clues arise in the case, police presume Jill is the killer, and Sophie is seemingly free.",
      "Sophie, however, pieces together that Margo is actually the killer and confronts her friend turned lover, who begs her not to tell, saying she loves her and \u201cfixed it.\u201d",
      "One fan theory states that Sophie actually fired the initial shots at Abby, but she didn\u2019t kill her \u2014 just like the boar \u2014 and Margo stepped in to deliver the kill shot to protect both Sophie and herself. Margo just never told Sophie about those initial shots, possibly to protect Sophie, who expressed guilt to Margo over a previous accident in the Northeast when she hit and killed a pedestrian while drinking and driving, according to the fan theory.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great theory,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to confirm or deny because who knows what will come out in future seasons.\u201d",
      "The Margo and Sophie of It All",
      "Before Sophie, Margo was in a secret romantic relationship on the side with Callie. But once Sophie comes to town, she becomes her focus, and Margo dumps Callie.",
      "Margo tells Sophie, \u201cThere\u2019s something about me that wants to protect you,\u201d and by contrast, later says to Callie, \u201cI\u2019m Margo f------ Banks. I don\u2019t need protection.\u201d",
      "Was this moment with Sophie a genuine one for Margo, and she was actually looking out for someone who wasn\u2019t herself?",
      "\u201cI always feel like with Margo \u2014 and actually I feel this way about humans in general \u2014 this is how I like to write characters. Everything can be both things at once,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cYou can be a manipulator but also mean it. So I do think she feels that way about Sophie, and I think that\u2019s one of the beautiful things about Brittany Snow\u2019s performance, is that everyone, I think, kind of feels like, \u2018I wish I could just wrap this girl up in a blanket because she\u2019s causing herself a lot of trouble.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd I think Margo definitely feels protective of her and loving of her, and it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all out of the goodness of her heart either. She obviously had ulterior motives.\u201d",
      "Cutter adds she believes the \u201crichest characters\u201d are \u201csort of femme fatale.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fun if they\u2019re just completely calculated monsters, but it\u2019s not fun if they don\u2019t have any evil intent, either,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere should always be multiple layers going on.\u201d",
      "Cobb said the Margo-Sophie dynamic in the show is similar to the book with \u201cSophie falling under her spell.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do think Margo has feelings for her, but Margo is a more transactional person and manipulator,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she genuinely cares for Sophie, but, you know, watch out if, oh, I just can't wait. I hope there's a Season 2 so we can find out what's going to happen.\u201d (The show has not yet been officially picked up for Season 2.)",
      "There are, of course, Margo and Sophie fans who want the pairing to be the endgame, while others don\u2019t think they\u2019d make it in the long run because Margo can be so toxic and self-serving.",
      "\u201cI just love Margo even \u2014 I love her either way,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, a Margo truther. I don\u2019t care if she\u2019s evil. I don\u2019t care if she was completely justified. I like her. I\u2019m going to watch her either way. I\u2019m going to sleep with her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, people want to really have it defined, and they want to have it defined by me. And I always say, like, \u2018Babe, make your own decision. I don\u2019t own the character. If you want to think that she\u2019s telling the truth, believe that. If you don\u2019t, it should work either way.\u2019\u201d",
      "(For the record, Cutter is a fan of the first wig Margo wears in the show, before going blond as Jed\u2019s campaign for governor gets underway. \u201cI\u2019m shocked that everyone hates it so much. I think she\u2019s iconic. \u2026 It looks fantastic on her and established her character.\u201d)",
      "Her Favorite Margo and Sophie Scene",
      "Cutter says the Margo and Sophie scene she loves the most is from the first episode, when Margo brings Sophie home following an intimate detour in a parking lot after a night out at the bar with the girls.",
      "\u201cI love the moment when Margo\u2019s dropping her off in that first episode, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to have so much fun together. I love you.\u2019 And Sophie goes, \u2018I love you, too.\u2019 It was exactly how I pictured it when I wrote it, which is that thing of \u2026 women do this all the time. We make fast friends, and we say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 not meaning it, exactly. \u2026 But then Sophie saying it in a different way. Obviously, she\u2019s not in love with her yet, but Brittany is putting all those levels into it where you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait, does she love her love her?\u2019 She\u2019s not just saying it back in the same tone that Margo was saying it. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d",
      "Cutter says she\u2019s seen the episode \u201chundreds of times in the editing room.\u201d",
      "\u201cErwin Stoff, who\u2019s the other executive producer, every time he knew that it would make me smile,\u201d she says of the scene. \u201cSo he would always look over and wait for me to be smiling at that take.\u201d",
      "Is Sophie in Love With Margo?",
      "Snow said she played the character of Sophie like she was in love with Margo.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like to speak for our fictional characters, even though I did write them,\u201d Cutter says. \u201cI certainly think she was falling in love with her.\u201d",
      "While the reveal of Margo as Abby\u2019s murderer \u201ccomplicates things,\u201d Cutter says, \u201cIt becomes a question of, like, \u2018Can you love someone knowing how deeply flawed they are?\u2019\u201d",
      "That\u2019s something that will have to be addressed in the future, as will the fallout of Sophie killing Margo\u2019s brother in the show\u2019s final moments of the first season.",
      "Will Margo ever be able to forgive Sophie? \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Cutter teases.",
      "One thing that is for certain is that Sophie has \u201cbeen in denial\u201d about her sexuality. A flashback reveals Sophie and her female college roommate crossed the friendship line and spent a romantic night together.",
      "\u201cI think that was important to me to show that it wasn\u2019t just \u2014 Margo is magical, even though she is, but, like, I mean she\u2019s magical to bring her out of it, but I did want to give Sophie more of a thorough queerness \u2026 a richer sense that it isn\u2019t just, \u2018Oh, Margo\u2019s this unicorn,\u2019 but that this is something Sophie has thought and felt before and been in denial about or pushing away. And that Margo is the one that\u2019s able to make it seem like a feasible life choice.\u201d",
      "Cobb said it was \u201csuper smart\u201d for Cutter to give Sophie \u201ca more compelling background.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe's falling head over heels for Margo,\u201d Cobb said of Sophie, \u201cand it's an unstoppable force.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the book, she doesn't have that backstory, and then Graham's need to sort of control her,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think there's a tension there of, \u2018Wow, there's absolutely nothing wrong with my home life. Husband's great, treats me great. And yet I cannot resist the siren call of Margo Banks.\u2019\u201d",
      "The show has led many people to share their thoughts online about how the show has made them rethink sexuality.",
      "Cutter says it\u2019s \u201cso rewarding\u201d to see her work be that \u201cclosely watched and processed.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou spend all this time writing something, and you don\u2019t know \u2014 people could just be there texting or doing their laundry or yelling at their kids and barely watching it,\u201d she says. \u201cSo to have people, like, making edits and really parsing out, like, \u2018What did that line mean?\u2019 or \u2018What was that look?\u2019 or \u2018Look at what her hand does there.\u2019",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like, oh my God, you feel so seen. And I\u2019m so grateful that people are feeling seen by this show. I love that it\u2019s a two-way street.\u201d"

      "\u201cThis season, Jackie\u2019s ready to face everything a little bit more head on. Season 1, she pushes everything away and runs away from her problems. And I think Season 2, she\u2019s trying not to do that,\u201d Nikki Rodriguez, who plays Jackie, tells TODAY.com.",

      "The couple decides not to say \"I do\" after Jeremiah accuses Belly of still being in love with his brother, Conrad (Christopher Briney).",
      "Jeremiah\u2019s change of heart is also largely due to a letter his mom, Susannah, who died several years before, wrote for him to read on his wedding day. While the letter was in an envelope addressed to Jeremiah, it is revealed during the episode that Susannah accidentally switched the letters. (Eagle-eyed viewers have spotted a moment from Season 2 in which a very sick Susannah, played by Rachel Blanchard, drops the letters she was writing, and Laurel, played by Jackie Chung, helps hastily stuff them back into their envelopes.)",

Oh, the way she looked at you \u2014 it was like you were the only boy in the world. As a mother, there is no greater gift than to see her child be so dearly loved by another person. Today, if there is even a fraction of the love I saw then, I am more than happy. I am overjoyed.",

She always knew what to say to Jeremiah. Jere started to cry as he read, and I turned my head away.\u201d",
      "After reading the letter, Jeremiah reveals that the letter was meant for Conrad. Upset by its contents, Jeremiah tells Conrad that he is not his brother anymore and leaves. Conrad then opens the letter and sees the \u201cDear Conrad\u201d at the top. He starts to cry, and the chapter ends.",
      "Later in the book, when Jeremiah ends the engagement with Belly, he tells her what the letter said.",
      "\u201cMy mom must have mixed up the envelopes,\u201d Jeremiah tells Belly. \u201cIn the letter she said \u2014 she said she only ever got to see him in love once. That was with you.\u201d",

While in line to board the plane, as Taylor Swift's \"Cardigan\" plays in the background, she sees Conrad. The screen fades to black and the credits roll before Conrad spots Belly, leaving fans on a slight cliffhanger before Episode 9 drops Sept. 3.",

      "\u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s engagement ring is seriously gorgeous and one of a kind,\u201d Megan Kothari, founder of fine jewelry brand AARYAH, tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt is probably a natural, elongated antique cushion-cut diamond of around eight to 10 carats.\u201d",
      "The cut of Swift\u2019s ring is \u201creally rare and hard to come by,\u201d Kothari continues.",

      "Harris estimates that the ring totals around $120,000 on the low end, but could cost as much as $500,000, depending on a variety of factors.",
      "\u201cThere are very few diamonds with this age, shape and cut on the worldwide market,\u201d Harris adds. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a unique stone, and that\u2019s definitely worth something.\u201d",
      "Rachel Enright, diamond and gem specialist at CustomMade Jewelers, says the ring, which she guesses is around eight carats, could be even more expensive than Harris estimates.",

      "Diamond dealer David Steinmetz estimates the ring could be about $800,000.",

    "story": [
      "With a birthday cake in hand, well-known Dominican Republic comedian Carlos S\u00e1nchez recounted in an Instagram post how 25-year-old Winifer N\u00fa\u00f1ez Beato died in 2021 after doctors on the island refused to end her high-risk pregnancy because of the country\u2019s total abortion ban.",
      "N\u00fa\u00f1ez Beato left behind a husband and a young daughter. In the video, S\u00e1nchez said the cake is not for his birthday, but rather to mark another year where he\u2019s asking for women not to die because of a law that stops doctors from saving their lives.",
      "S\u00e1nchez told NBC News he felt compelled to use his platform to raise awareness because \u201cit\u2019s a barbarity that in this day and age a mother has to put her life at risk over a risky pregnancy that could be ended but the law prohibits doctors to do so.\u201d",
      "S\u00e1nchez is among many artists and activists in the Dominican Republic taking part in a social media campaign to push for amending a recently passed penal code that maintains a complete ban on abortion. Many artists have used their platforms to tell the stories of Dominican women who have lost their lives to pregnancy-related conditions.",
      "On Instagram, singer and actress Techy Fatule tells the story of Damaris Mejia, who went to three different hospitals when she started feeling ill and had a high fever. According to Fatule, medical personnel didn\u2019t know what to do with Mejia\u2019s high-risk pregnancy. She was sent home with painkillers and died that night. Fatule says doctors couldn\u2019t save her because of the ban, and ends with words, \u201cLife is full of exceptions.\u201d",
      "The Dominican Republic is a conservative country that features the Bible on its flag. The country signed a concordat, or agreement, with the Vatican in 1954 making Catholicism the state religion, though the constitution allows freedom of worship.",
      "The country\u2019s Catholic Church backs the abortion ban, as well as evangelical groups. But Alianza Cristiana Dominicana, a group formed in 2017 by women of different Christian denominations, is pushing for the penal code to include what are known in the region as the \u201ctres causales,\u201d or three causes or circumstances where ending pregnancies should be allowed: when the woman\u2019s life is at risk, in the case of rape or incest, and when fetal malformations are incompatible with life. The \u201ctres causales\u201d are used in other countries throughout Latin America that have eased total bans on abortion.",
      "Alianza Cristiana Dominicana has partnered with the artists to share the stories.",
      "So far this year, there have been 100 documented maternal deaths in the Dominican Republic. Natalia M\u00e1rmol, of the Coalition for Women\u2019s Lives and Rights, believes those lives could have been saved if abortions were legal.",
      "\u201cThis is a fight to guarantee minimum protection for life, health and dignity for girls and women,\u201d said M\u00e1rmol. \u201cWe are asking for minimal protections, so women don\u2019t die on a hospital bed. So a 13- or 15-year-old girl is not obliged to continue with a pregnancy that is the product of a rape. And so a woman can decide when a pregnancy is not viable.\u201d",
      "The Dominican Republic\u2019s previous penal code had been in place since 1884, and efforts to reform it failed for decades. The new penal code was approved by legislators and signed into law by President Luis Abinader.",
      "Abinader had previously expressed support for making exceptions to the abortion ban, but after winning re-election he didn\u2019t push for changes.",
      "After the vote, Abinader said the penal code, which covers many types of crime, \u201cis not the ideal but it\u2019s the best possible, since among other things, it substitutes legislation that dates back to 1884.\u201d",
      "M\u00e1rmol said the new penal code does include points that the group advocated for, like the classification of femicide, the intentional killing of a woman or girl, as well as an increase in the severity of punishment for sexual assault.",
      "She said the new penal code does not go into effect until August 2026 and there is time to tweak the law to include the three exceptions.",
      "The Coalition for the Life and Rights of Women and other groups have pushed for years to have the three exceptions included, even erecting a camp in 2021 in front of the National Palace to pressure parliament.",
      "In the Dominican Republic, women face up to two years in prison for having an abortion and doctors and midwives can receive five to 20 years for terminating a pregnancy.",
      "Four other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean maintain a total prohibition on abortion, including Haiti, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Most of Latin America and the Caribbean allows abortion in limited cases.",

      "Al-Masri\u2019s live feed freezes at 10:08 a.m. local time but there\u2019s no video of the first strikes. Video of the aftermath of these hits shows smoke billowing from two separate staircases: the one where journalists were working and a second, around the corner next to the intensive care unit.",

      "Minutes later, at 10:17 a.m., after journalists and first responders arrived on the staircase used by journalists \u2014 including men carrying a gurney seen on video wearing clearly identifiable high visibility vests \u2014 a second strike hits.",
      "Video obtained and verified by NBC News shows two additional projectiles striking the fourth-floor staircase within milliseconds of each other. Plumes of smoke can be seen rising from all affected areas.",
      "N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of the arms intelligence firm Armament Research Services, said video of the incident after the first strike pointed to a direct-fire weapon, with damage \u201cconsistent with that expected from a multi-purpose tank gun projectile.\u201d",
      "Video of the second strike also appeared to show two projectiles, he said. Their flight pattern and \u201cbright emission\u2026 more likely to be from a tracer\u201d suggested they came from tank rounds, Jenzen-Jones said. The timing, he added, implies \u201ctwo tanks may have fired on the target simultaneously.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not respond to a request for comment on the newest revelations. The IDF has not provided NBC News with any additional information since it released preliminary findings on Tuesday.",
      "In its initial inquiry, the IDF said troops had identified a camera at the hospital \u201cpositioned by Hamas\u201d that was being used to observe its activity. It added that \u201ctroops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\u201d",
      "But according to multiple eyewitnesses on the ground, including journalists and doctors at the hospital, there was only one camera positioned on the roof of the hospital: al-Masri\u2019s Reuters camera.",

      "More details emerged Thursday about Israel's deadly attack on Nasser Hospital.",
      "Initially, Monday\u2019s pair of deadly Israeli strikes appeared to be a \u201cdouble tap\u201d attack, in which the same target was hit twice in quick succession. The tactic, military analysts say, is to wait for first responders to race to the scene of the first attack before striking again.",
      "But an NBC News analysis of newly obtained video has found that at least four Israeli munitions were fired at the medical complex.",
      "Following the first Israeli strike on the facility, the video shows two projectiles flying through the air, striking the fourth-floor staircase in quick succession at 10:17 a.m. local time Monday.",

      "The cryptocurrency industry has become big business for the Trump family, whose patriarch has become one of its biggest champions since it helped return him to office.",
      "Feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry was a political force in the 2024 election season, directing an estimated $135 million in donations toward Trump and other crypto-friendly candidates.",

      "Since returning to office in January, Trump has pushed to ease regulation of the industry, shut down the Justice Department\u2019s national cryptocurrency enforcement team, appointed a \u201ccrypto czar\u201d and held a White House summit for industry leaders.

      "Trump, who said in 2021 that Bitcoin \u201cseems like a scam,\u201d has since embraced it as a moneymaking opportunity, sometimes at great cost to investors. According to the watchdog group State Democracy Defenders Fund, as of mid-March his crypto assets were valued at $2.9 billion, or about 37% of his total wealth.",
      "Much of that money, which Trump earned in about six months, came from ventures such as the $TRUMP coin that he launched ahead of his inauguration, which was trading at nearly $8 on Friday, down from its peak of $73 in January. A meme coin was also launched for first lady Melania Trump.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Diana, Princess of Wales, is for many a symbol of life in the 1990s. And now a time capsule she buried nearly 35 years ago has been opened, revealing a treasure trove of memorabilia.",
      "The capsule was placed inside a wall at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London in 1991 with the help of two children who won a TV competition.",
      "It contained relics of a pre-internet-enabled age, including an early pocket TV, a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator and a copy of The Times newspaper.",
      "The items were decided via a competition run by the long-running British children\u2019s TV show \u201cBlue Peter\u201d \u2014 viewers were asked to decide eight things that represented life in the 1990s. Despite some moisture damage, the items were still recognizable.",
      "The box was not due to be opened until centuries had passed, but the timeline had to be drastically cut short because the hospital is demolishing existing buildings to build a new children\u2019s cancer center.",
      "The CD was the choice of David Watson, then age 11, from Devon in western England, as well as a sheet of recycled paper and a European passport.",
      "A collection of British coins, a container with five tree seeds and a snowflake hologram were the choices of Sylvia Foulkes, then age 9, from Norwich in eastern England.",
      "It's unclear what the children, who would both now be in their 40s, thought of the opening. The hospital told NBC News that it was no longer in touch with them.",
      "The hospital asked staff members either born in 1991 or already working there in 1991 to help remove the capsule.",
      "One of the latter, senior health play specialist Janet Holmes, said: \"It brought back so many memories seeing the pocket TV in there \u2014 I had bought one for my husband back in the day, for when he had a break whilst driving his coach around the country. They were very expensive then!\"",
      "Anyone born in or after the 1990s may struggle to understand that this coveted gadget \u2014 the Casio TV430 \u2014 had a 2-inch screen and a battery life of just a few hours.",
      "Minogue, the Australian singer then famous in Britain for a string of pop hits, as well as her role in the TV soap opera \"Neighbours,\" is still a major international star.",
      "CDs, however, were then relatively new: They surpassed cassettes and LPs as the leading music format in the United States only in 1991.",
      "Great Ormond Street, known as GOSH, is the U.K.\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospital and a major center for pediatric research in Europe. Diana became its president in 1989 and visited multiple times.",
      "Diana was part of the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the Variety Club Building in 1991 \u2014 to mark it, she sealed a time capsule in the hospital's main entrance.",
      "She was following royal tradition: A former Princess of Wales, Alexandria, laid the foundation stone for an older GOSH building in 1872 and also sealed a time capsule. Curiously, however, the hospital said that capsule has still never been found.",
      "GOSH said the new cancer center \"will make it easier for clinical teams to develop kinder, more effective treatments, all delivered in a child-focused environment where children can play, learn and be with their family while at hospital.\"",
      "While the hospital is run by the taxpayer-funded National Health Service, it still has to raise money for big projects, and the 300 million-pound ($403 million) fundraising drive to build the new center is the biggest in its history."

      "Instead of a presidential palace, he is speaking from a humble house in Dover, a port city in the south of England. And the Free Republic of Verdis, the country he claims to have founded in 2019, is nothing more than a small strip of uninhabited forest on the border between Croatia and Serbia, more than 1,000 miles away.",

      "\u201cVerdis was an idea when I was about 14 but it came back, and actually, we actually properly created the state after I had turned 18,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason being is it was just an idea that initially came up with a lot of people that I know that did humanitarian work in Ukraine. And we wanted to do something that was a bit, a bit bigger than, you know, just doing aid to one country.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cWe want to be a neutral state. We want to be a hub for NGOs. We have a massive humanitarian background.\u201d",
      "Those lofty goals may be tempered by the reality of neighboring countries who don\u2019t recognize the existence of Verdis and may be hostile to its potential citizens.",
      "\u201cIn October 2023 is when we started a settlement, and a few days later Croatian authorities quickly destroyed that settlement,\u201d Jackson said, noting that he was given a permanent ban from Croatia and the other settlers were banned for three months.",
      "He added, \u201cI\u2019ve been to Verdis a lot of times before Croatian authorities invaded Verdis. We did a lot of cadastral work, a lot of surveying. We planted a flag for the first time earlier that year.\u201d",
      "Jackson was at least partially inspired by Liberland, another unclaimed pocket of land between Croatia and Serbia that in 2015 was turned into a microstate by Czech politician V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka.",
      "It is a symbolic state that offers virtual citizenship and an economy based on cryptocurrencies, but it has not been recognized by any official country, and Croatian authorities have blocked physical access to it.",
      "Jackson says that while he shares some principles with Liberland, he wants the Free Republic of Verdis to become an actual settlement whose citizens are driven by noble principles.",
      "\u201cWe have the opportunity to test, for example, new systems of governance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can allow citizens to have a bit of a fresh start. So people coming from all over the world that want to try something new basically.\u201d",
      "For now, Verdis only exists on a website where people can apply for citizenship. According to Jackson, 15,000 people have applied so far, and 400 have already been handed over physical passports and IDs. Legitimate or not, Verdisian documents have been used to cross borders.",
      "\u201cThere are instances of successful crossings but it\u2019s not something that we will promote unless that country recognizes our documents officially,\u201d Jackson chuckles.",

      "Russia launched another massive overnight attack across Ukraine as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of dragging out peace negotiations and pushed for fresh meetings with the U.S. and European allies.",
      "The latest strikes killed at least two people and injured dozens more on Friday night, according to Ukrainian officials, while the nations air force reported that 582 drones and missiles were fired across the nation, the vast majority intercepted.",
      "\u201cEight people have been hospitalized, among them two children, a 10-year-old boy, and 16-year-old girl, Ivan Fedorov, governor of Ukraine\u2019s Zaporizhzhya region, said Saturday morning.",
      "The assault followed Thursday\u2019s massive attack on the capital Kyiv, which Zelenskyy said killed at least 25 people \u2014 including four children \u2014 injured dozens more, and cut power to 60,000 residents.",
      "Authorities in the capital declared Friday an official day of mourning.",
      "The latest bombardments are among the most intense to hit Ukraine during the three-and-a-half-year war, underscoring both Russia\u2019s escalating tactics and the paralysis of international mediation despite weeks of negotiations and diplomacy.",
      "President Donald Trump hosted his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a whirlwind summit two weeks ago aimed at breaking through the in the war. European leaders then traveled at the Oval Office to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Trump has since pushed to arrange a summit between Zelenskyy and Putin, but peace talks have stalled amid heavy bombing of Ukraine by Russia which has dragged its feet over a meeting.",
      "Zelenskyy accused Moscow Friday of stalling by insisting that lower-level officials complete groundwork before any summit between Putin and Zelenskyy.",
      "That reasoning, he told reporters in Kyiv, is \u201cartificial \u2026 because they want to show the United States that they are constructive, but they are not constructive.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said he hopes to meet next week with Trump and European leaders to revive stalled peace efforts.",
      "Trump, frustrated by Putin\u2019s delays on direct talks with Zelenskyy, said a week ago he expected to decide on next steps in two weeks if direct talks aren\u2019t scheduled.",

      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration approved an $825 million arms package on Thursday, including extended-range missiles to bolster Ukraine\u2019s defenses.",
      "The State Department said Thursday it had notified Congress of the sale, and that Ukraine would use funding from NATO allies in addition to U.S. foreign military financing to pay for the equipment."

    "story": [
      "STEVENAGE, England \u2014 A tide of red and white is rising across England \u2014 hoisted on lampposts, daubed on crosswalks, stuck on apartment windows.",
      "Those behind it insist this campaign to raise the English flag, known as St. George\u2019s Cross, is an expression of patriotism; others see the sudden prevalence of the banner, sometimes associated with soccer hooliganism and racism, as a hostile statement of surging far-right sentiment.",
      "The febrile debate went global this week when Elon Musk, the former adviser to President Donald Trump and backer of far-right movements globally, posted a picture of the flag on X. Vice President JD Vance also staged his latest intervention into British life, urging people to \u201cpush back against the crazies\u201d who criticize flying the flag.",
      "'Operation Raise the Colours'",
      "In a country where the national flag is rare outside of sporting events, the banners now fluttering above a highway here in Stevenage are typical of those popping up nationwide in recent weeks as part of the grassroots \u201cOperation Raise the Colours.\u201d",
      "The flags were put up here last week by a five-strong group including Louis Turvey, who read about the national movement on Facebook, where he said he gets most of his news.",
      "Turvey, 33, who has Roma-Gypsy heritage and was raised in London, 30 minutes away by train, says he was in no way motivated by far-right or hostile feelings. Rather he wanted to do something positive and fly his national flag \u201clike you see on holiday in Greece or Spain,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI saw all the flags going up around the country and thought, \u2018How lovely is that?\u2019 But I went for a little drive round Stevenage and didn\u2019t see any,\u201d Turvey, a former demolition worker with auburn curls, hipster moustache, low-buttoned shirt and a single earing, told NBC News over coffee at a nearby Starbucks. \u201cI kept thinking: Who\u2019s going to do it\u201d around here? \u201cWell you know what, I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d",
      "He met his fellow flaggers through his online handle \"Stevenage Patriots\" and had never met them before, he said. \u201cI\u2019m gay and a lot of my friends are girls, so I was quite nervous hanging around with four straight lads,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it was such a lovely evening, quite spiritual actually, quite calming.\u201d",
      "However he soon experienced just how charged this debate has become when, just as his group was packing up, someone threw two Molotov cocktails at them, the second cutting Turvey\u2019s head and covering his face with blood. \u201cI thought I was going to die,\u201d he said, visibly shaken by an incident he says has put a pause on his flag-hoisting activities for the time being at least.",
      "Critics see darker forces undergirding the broader flag campaign.",
      "They view this groundswell as little more than an aggressive, provocative message to people with an immigrant background and nonwhite residents.",
      "The anti-racist campaign group Hope Not Hate reported that the founders of Operation Raise the Colours include \u201cwell-known far-right extremists\u201d and allies of Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record who has become a leading nationalist voice in Britain. Indeed, Musk himself has used his X audience of 223 million to voice support for Robinson, as well as other far-right figures in Britain and across Europe.",
      "NBC News messaged the three administrators of the Operation Raise the Colours Facebook page, asking for comment and interviews with these founders, but did not receive a response.",
      "These fears are widespread. When a St. George\u2019s Cross was painted on the wall of St. John the Baptist church, in the town of Lincoln, the vicar, Rachel Heskins, saw it as a clear \u201cattempt to intimidate\u201d the diverse local community.",
      "\u201cThe St. George\u2019s Cross has become a symbol of nationalism which has become confused with patriotism \u2014 the two are very different,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "All this comes as immigration is now the top issue for voters in England, having just overtaken the cost-of-living crisis throttling millions, polls show. The most popular political party is Reform U.K., led by Trump ally and friend Nigel Farage, who recently said he would carry out a mass deportation of 600,000 people if he wins the next election in 2029.",
      "National identity in Britain is doubly complicated because the United Kingdom includes the nations of England, Wales and Scotland, and the province of Northern Ireland. During the soccer World Cup and on some public holidays, England\u2019s banner is widely used by people of all political and demographic stripes, but outside of those events it has been co-opted by nationalists, the far-right and even fascists.",
      "All the data shows that most people in Britain are becoming more tolerant and less racist, said Sunder Katwala, the director of British Future, a think tank focused on identity. But the small minority who do hold extreme and racist views have been given a megaphone and a meeting place by poorly regulated social media platforms, he said.",
      "That\u2019s certainly the experience of Moj, 44, a Briton with Bangladeshi heritage, sitting with his 11-year-old daughter in Stevenage\u2019s faded postwar town square.",
      "\u201cI remember being a kid and getting called all sorts of racist names. I don\u2019t get that anymore,\u201d said Moj, who like many in this town of 80,000 declined to give his second name for fear of local backlash.",
      "Despite the improvement, the flag still holds negative connotations for him. \u201dIn certain areas, if I see an English flag, there is always a part of me that thinks, OK, I've got to be a bit careful here,\u201d he said.",
      "Stevenage was dreamed up in 1946 as an example of \u201cnew town\u201d modernism, an integrated residential-commercial space in which to house families scattered by war. Today \u2014 despite a much needed \u00a31 billion ($1.35 billion) regeneration scheme on the way \u2014 its faded pebbledash and dated glass shopfronts feel like a cipher for modern Britain.",
      "As is the case across the West, many Britons are increasingly concerned and angry about rising prices, decrepit public services, a lack of housing \u2014 and the perception that immigration has been mismanaged.",
      "All this leaves \u201cthe U.K. sitting on a tinderbox of disconnection and division,\u201d according to a lengthy report last month by British Future. Compounded by the cost-of-living crisis and supercharged by social media, this is \u201cturning the chronic crisis of social disconnection into an acute threat of social division.\u201d",
      "Turvey hanging flags in his community then being struck by a Molotov cocktail saw those divisions flare into life. He was bandaged up, received stitches and gave a statement to the police, though he did not see his attackers and has not heard from officers since, he said.",
      "At first, he thought the blood running down his face was acid (acid attacks are on the rise in the U.K.), and he said the incident has only added to the chronic anxiety stemming from a homophobic attack in 2018.",
      "Though he decries any form of racism or negativity associated with the flag movement, he says that part of his motivation stemmed from the perception that the current Labour government \u201cis not siding with English people\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s probably why people are so upset at the moment.\u201d",
      "Indeed, polls show Labour at its lowest support since 2019, sinking to just 20% of the vote in a poll by YouGov this week. Farage\u2019s Reform party, meanwhile, has soared to 28%, according to the same top pollster, the highest of any party but not enough to govern without a coalition were a national vote held today. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has taken an increasingly hard rhetorical line on immigration.",
      "He is under pressure to deal with the \u201csmall boats\u201d crisis, in which more than 50,000 people have arrived in small, unsafe vessels across the English Channel from France since he won a landslide election last year. Meanwhile, the government won a Supreme Court battle Friday so that asylum seekers could continue being housed at a hotel in Epping, northeast of London, a site that has sparked numerous protests and counterprotests.",
      "Rumbling underneath all of this is the so-called grooming gangs scandal: the sexual exploitation of young women and girls by men in British towns and cities. A review in June that found that, although most alleged perpetrators were white, in some areas there were higher rates of men of Asian and Pakistani heritage than their equivalent share of the population . At the same time, the review warned that many of those claiming outrage were merely trying \u201cto spread division and hate across communities.\u201d",
      "And so, amid all this, up goes the English flag.",
      "\u201cThere are probably one or two locations where it\u2019s organic and it started from below,\u201d Katawala, the director of British Future, said. \u201cThen there\u2019s another group \u2014 again, it\u2019s quite a small group \u2014 which is very politically radicalized, knows what it\u2019s doing and why it\u2019s doing it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Through a monitor, two men watch a bomb tumble through the air toward a building at the edge of town. \u201cLook at how they run,\u201d one of the men says.",
      "The drone\u2019s camera follows a group of people below as they sprint down the road before the mortar explodes.",
      "These scenes of destruction, carried out and filmed by drones, have defined the war in Ukraine. But this drone is thousands of miles away in Colombia, the latest mutation in the country\u2019s deadly, long-standing conflict between the national government and militant groups.",
      "It\u2019s also an example of the growing use of drone warfare in Latin America and other parts of the globe.",
      "Seventeen videos posted on social media and verified by NBC News show that these groups, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), are using drones for surveillance, intimidation and bombing campaigns \u2014 targeting rival groups, soldiers, police and civilians across the country, injuring and killing dozens in the past year.",
      "Militants have focused their assaults on areas where they already possess greater control: in Catatumbo, a region of dense jungle bordering Venezuela, and Cauca, on Colombia\u2019s west coast, notorious for its smuggling routes in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "It was in Cauca last year in the town of El Plateado that a 10-year-old boy was killed by a grenade dropped from a drone onto a field during a soccer game. The boy, identified as \u201cDylan\u201d by Brig. Gen. Federico Mej\u00eda, commander of the armed forces in Cauca, was the first death from a drone strike in the country. Twelve others were injured in the explosion.",
      "The rate of strikes has rapidly accelerated since. \u201cEvery day they try and attack,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "In 2024, the Colombian Defense Ministry recorded 119 drone-related attacks. In 2025, attacks have doubled, with 180 incidents documented as of August.",
      "The sound of fear",
      "The drones \u2014 cheap, easy to operate and widely available online \u2014 are altered to carry explosives filled with nails, pieces of chainsaws and metal bolts, Mej\u00eda said. Used for surveillance and strikes, they can fly more than 1,000 feet above, making them virtually imperceptible to people on the ground.",
      "\u201cThe human ear can\u2019t hear it,\u201d said Secretary Luis Fernando Ni\u00f1o Lopez, high commissioner for peace in Norte de Santander, a region that encompasses Catatumbo. Drones, he said, have allowed militant groups to go beyond traditional battlefields and reach civilians.",
      "\u201cBefore, the war was body to body,\u201d Ni\u00f1o Lopez said. \u201cHowever, this changed to personal attacks, looking from house to house and using drones.\u201d",
      "In other instances, surveillance and intimidation go hand in hand. \u201cThe word is \u2018zumbido\u2019 (\u2018buzz\u2019),\u201d said Juanita Goebertus, director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch. In interviews the organization conducted with Indigenous communities in Catatumbo, residents described the \u201chumming sound\u201d from drones monitoring the population.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge fear created now in Catatumbo whenever there\u2019s the sound of a drone going around,\u201d she said.",
      "\u2018We can do that\u2019",
      "The adoption of drones marks the latest evolution in a conflict that has raged for over half a century in Colombia, experts said. In 2016, the government reached a peace agreement with the country\u2019s largest rebel group, FARC. The agreement was criticized from many sides, including some FARC militants who refused to disarm and continued operating in smaller numbers.",
      "With the reduction in their ranks, militant groups \u2014 no strangers to asymmetrical warfare \u2014 changed tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of a sort of criminal learning,\u201d Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said. \u201cThey see what\u2019s happening in Ukraine, the extremely broad use of drones. They think, \u2018Hey, we can do that.\u2019 Then one group starts in Colombia, and it spreads like wildfire.\u201d",
      "Over the past few years, videos emerged on social media of militants experimenting with store-bought drones. A video from 2023 shows fighters from a FARC dissident group testing the weight of a grenade tied to the body of a drone with a piece of string.",
      "\u201cOften, these munitions are very rudimentary,\u201d Dickinson said. \u201cThe majority of attacks have been aimed at police or military targets or rival armed groups, but often they are exploding, obviously, in areas that affect civilians, because they are, by definition, an indiscriminate weapon.\u201d",
      "\u2018Drone comes, drone goes\u2019",
      "Civilians, especially children, in Cauca and Catatumbo have ended up on both ends of drone attacks. Last August, authorities arrested a 16-year-old who they said had operated a drone that dropped a bomb on a police building.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of the guys who put together these drones, who run them being 16, 17, 18 years old,\u201d Dickinson said. Child recruitment in Colombia has soared in the past several years, she said, increasing over 1,000% between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Commercial drones are relatively simple to operate, and children, already predisposed to mastering new technology, are ideal targets for recruitment. \u201cMy son is 13 and manages a drone perfectly,\u201d Mej\u00eda said.",
      "Children in Colombia are increasingly vulnerable to the lures of militant groups, who have used social media apps like TikTok and WhatsApp to promote a glamorized version of the guerrilla lifestyle, according to experts, who also point to the absence of schoolteachers, many of whom have fled the violence in the region, as a contributing factor.",
      "A cycle of attacks, forced recruitment and instability has brought about Colombia\u2019s largest displacement from one region in at least 28 years. More than 73,000 people have fled Norte de Santander, according to the Ombudsman\u2019s Office of Colombia.",
      "For half a year, Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Abril, 55, known to his friends and family as Carmito, has been running for his life. The farmer and social leader from Catatumbo told NBC News he\u2019s a target of the ELN. In January, he was rescued by military police along with 19 other farmers after the rebel group launched several attacks against rival FARC dissidents. Speaking to Colombian media weeks after he was rescued, he said he was targeted due to his past in farmworker struggles and his previous support for the Uni\u00f3n Patri\u00f3tica, a party linked with FARC.",
      "Now in hiding, Abril hears updates from his siblings and nephews who remain in Catatumbo.",
      "Drones, which at one time promised to be a technological advancement for farmers in Colombia, have become a symbol of terror.",
      "\u201cCatatumbo is becoming drone comes, drone goes,\u201d Abril said. \u201cThere is a fear of drones since farmers are military targets for the ELN.\u201d",
      "Amid the exchange of attacks from the ELN and FARC dissidents in the region, drones have dropped explosives on the homes of people in the countryside. In May, a 12-year-old and his mother were killed in Tib\u00fa when a drone dropped a grenade on their house, Abril said.",
      "\u2018A major risk for the future\u2019",
      "The military and government of Colombia have recently taken measures to stem the surge of drone attacks. The Defense Ministry has proposed a series of bills that would create a national registry for drones and classify strikes on civilians as terrorism.",
      "Soldiers have also started using anti-drone technology, devices that can locate unmanned aircraft and jam their signals. Since implementing these defenses, Mej\u00eda said, his forces have reduced the number of these attacks by 80% in Cauca.",
      "Devices for countering drones are by no means ubiquitous. Soldiers and police often try to shoot drones out of the sky, a relatively ineffective measure that creates its own public safety risks when they are shot down above crowded areas.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re very hard to shoot down,\u201d said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cIf you\u2019re a civilian living in rural Colombia, and there is a drone that can drop bombs from hundreds of feet above you or can fly in and detonate the explosive, you really have virtually no recourse.\u201d",
      "The country is facing another challenge to its ability to fight the rapidly evolving strategies and equipment of militant forces. At risk are hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aid tied up in a certification process of the country\u2019s commitment to the war on drugs.",
      "Colombia has narrowly avoided decertification in past years, but it has failed to cut the illegal growth of coca crops, which has risen each year in the past decade, according to data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.",
      "By Sept. 15, President Donald Trump will decide whether to cut off aid to Colombia. Cutting off the supply of resources and technologies to the country could cripple its efforts to fight militants in the future, said Alberto Jos\u00e9 Mej\u00eda Ferrero, a former general for Colombia\u2019s armed forces. He added that it would be \u201cvery bad for our strategy, for approach, and especially for the very, very strong relationship that the military forces of Colombia and our national police had with the U.S. for decades.\u201d",
      "The adoption of drone warfare by militant groups in Latin America is not unique to Colombia. Already, Mexican cartels have used drones to attack police and one another. In Ecuador, a drone targeted the roof of a high-security prison to force a jailbreak.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s a major risk for the future,\u201d Ziemer said. \u201cI think the region as a whole has yet to come to terms with the scale and potential scale of the threat we\u2019re seeing.\u201d"

      "According to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, heads of state and government from 26 countries will be at the parade, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. North Korean state media also confirmed that Kim was attending the parade at the invitation of Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "The United States and its allies are staying away from the event, partly out of protest over the presence of Putin, who faces an outstanding arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court over alleged war crimes in his war against Ukraine.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said that China and North Korea were \u201ctraditional friendly neighbors\u201d and that the government \u201cwarmly\u201d welcomed Kim to attend the parade, where China will display some of its most advanced weaponry.",
      "\u201cDuring the arduous years of war, the peoples of China and North Korea supported each other and fought side by side against Japanese aggression, making important contributions to the victory of the global anti-fascist war and the cause of human justice,\u201d Hong Lei, director-general of the ministry\u2019s Department of Protocol, told reporters.",

      "Kim rarely leaves North Korea, which has been isolated by international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "North Korean state news agency KCNA did not say when he would leave for China, how long he would be there or whether he would have official meetings with Xi, Putin or any other leaders. Kim has not visited China, North Korea\u2019s biggest trading partner, since before the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though China has supported international sanctions against North Korea\u2019s weapons programs, it is also an economic lifeline for Pyongyang, accounting for about 98% of its external trade last year.",
      "China-North Korea ties have been strained in recent years by North Korea\u2019s growing partnership with Russia, where North Korea has sent artillery and troops to support Moscow in its war against Ukraine. Experts say that in exchange Russia may be providing advanced military technology that North Korea could use for its weapons programs.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea is seeking to strengthen ties with China following its moves with Russia, thereby showcasing socialist solidarity among North Korea, China and Russia,\u201d Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea, told NBC News.",

      "The combined strikes were the most significant to hit Kyiv since President Donald Trump intensified his push for an end to the Kremlin\u2019s war, an effort that has stalled in the past week. A total of 629 drones and missiles were fired at the country overnight, Ukraine's air force said, one of the largest of the war.",
      "The overnight attacks show clearly that Russia has chosen \u201cballistics over the negotiating table,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X.",
      "Among the three children killed was a 2-year-old, said Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv\u2019s city administration. Ten other minors were injured, he said in a post on Telegram.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 President Donald Trump was set to chair a meeting Wednesday about the future of Gaza, as Israel faced mounting global outcry over strikes on a hospital that killed 22 people, including journalists and medics.",
      "Israeli and American officials will attend the discussions on the aftermath of the war, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said, even as the U.S. ally moves ahead with a new phase of a campaign that has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed the Palestinian enclave\u2019s largest city into famine.",
      "Pope Leo XIV added his voice to a growing chorus of pressure to end the war, while NBC News spoke to eyewitnesses who contradicted the Israeli military's explanation for the attack on Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very comprehensive plan we\u2019re putting together,\u201d Witkoff told Fox News late Tuesday, adding that it reflected Trump\u2019s \u201chumanitarian motives.\u201d Hamas, Witkoff said, was \u201cnow signaling that they\u2019re open to a settlement\u201d to end the 22-month war. \u201cWe\u2019re going to settle this one way or another, certainly before the end of this year,\u201d he added.",
      "Israel has not publicly responded to the latest ceasefire proposal, which the militant group agreed to last week.",
      "Five journalists were among 20 killed on Monday during \u201cdouble tap\u201d strikes, which was caught on video by the Arabic-language channel Al Ghad TV, whose correspondent Ibrahim al Qanan was live on TV when the second strike hit. He said timestamps on the video showed that there was 7 minutes between the explosions.",
      "Responders, including journalists and rescue workers, waited a few minutes after the first hit before they raced up the stairs only to be caught in the second blast, he added.",
      "The death toll rose to 22 on Wednesday after two of those wounded in Monday's attack died of their injuries, the Health Ministry in Gaza said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement on X that an initial inquiry found that troops had identified a camera at the hospital that was being used to observe its troops \u201cin order to direct terrorist activities against them.\u201d It added that \u201ctroops operated to remove the threat by striking and dismantling the camera.\u201d",
      "The statement, which did not provide evidence to substantiate the claims or address the second strike on the facility, added that an investigation had been ordered into \u201cseveral gaps\u201d including the \u201cauthorization process\u201d before the attack.",
      "But according to five journalists on the ground there was only one camera on the hospital\u2019s roof. The Reuters news agency said it had been running a live feed from the site for the last 18 months. A senior Hamas official claimed it did not have a camera in the area.",
      "\"Israel was fully aware that Reuters and multiple other news organizations were operating from Nasser hospital, which has been one of the nerve centers for coverage out of Gaza,\" a Reuters spokesperson said in a statement. \"Reuters has frequently broadcast a feed from Nasser hospital during the war, and for the past several weeks had been delivering daily feeds from the hospital position that was hit.\"",
      "Dr. Mohammed Saqer, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News that the IDF should have been aware that the area it was targeting at the hospital was a hub for journalists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret place. It\u2019s like a clear place, obvious place. Everyone can see this place. Even the Israeli army, by their own drones or by their own cameras, they can see Hussam and other journalists working from the fourth floor. So it\u2019s not a secret,\u201d he said, referring to Hussam al-Masri, a Reuters contractor cameraman killed in the attack.",
      "He added, \u201cThe IDF knows our numbers. Yes, sometimes they call us. So if the IDF has any objection about the presence of Hussam and other journalists on the third floor, on the fourth floor, I think they could have contacted us and we could have fixed the issue.\u201d",
      "Among the dead were Mariam Dagga, 33, a visual journalist, who freelanced for The Associated Press and other news outlets during the war. Al Jazeera confirmed that one of its journalists, Mohammed Salama, was also among the dead, while Reuters reported that Moaz Abu Taha, a freelancer who worked occasionally for the organization, died in the Israeli bombing along with al-Masri. Ahmad Abu Aziz, who Middle East Eye said worked as a freelancer, was also killed.",
      "Asked about the strikes, Trump said he was \u201cnot happy about it,\u201d adding, \u201cWe have to end this whole nightmare.\u201d",
      "Other Western leaders were more forceful in their criticism.",

      "\u201cI beg for a permanent ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of humanitarian aid to be facilitated and humanitarian law to be fully respected,\u201d the first American pontiff said during his weekly general audience attended by thousands of people in the Vatican\u2019s auditorium.",
      "His comments came as Israeli forces continued to push into the outskirts of Gaza City ahead of a major planned offensive on the area.",
      "Eyewitnesses reported tanks had entered a neighborhood on the city's northern edge late Tuesday and shelled houses, wounding several people and forcing many others to move deeper into the city.",
      "The offensive continues days after famine was declared in Gaza city by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world's leading authority on food crises.",
