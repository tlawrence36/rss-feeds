      "Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince\u2019s only full sibling, died Monday",
      "NEW YORK -- Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince's only full sibling, died Monday at North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, her son President Nelson confirmed to The Associated Press. She was 64.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, and President Nelson said he doesn't expect to know \u201cfor a couple of days.\u201d",
      "Born to jazz musician John L. Nelson and Mattie Della Shaw in 1960, two years after Prince, Nelson was a singer-songwriter, releasing four albums across her career, starting with 1988's \u201cRoyal Blue.\" That album produced her biggest hits, \u201cMarc Anthony\u2019s Tune,\u201d which spent 11 weeks on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 33, and \u201cL.O.V.E.,\" which spent seven weeks on the chart and topped at No. 52.",
      "At the time, she told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, \u201cThe album is basically about love relationships between a man and a woman. I\u2019m royal blue because I can\u2019t find him,\u201d she said.",
      "It's an alternative to her brother's chosen color of purple. Of their relationship, she said: \u201cThe funniest thing is people say, \u2018How does it feel to be Prince\u2019s sister?\u2019 They don\u2019t actually realize what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been Prince\u2019s sister ever since I got here on Earth.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press described her \u201cRoyal Blue\u201d album as \"mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening\" material, \u201cfar removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound. Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Then came 1992's \u201cYellow Moon, Red Sky,\u201d 2008's \u201cA Brand New Me,\u201d and finally, 2011's \u201cHustler.\u201d",
      "Nelson is survived by two sons, President and Sir, and five grandchildren.",
      "\u201cBorn 1960, the daughter of Mattie and John Nelson, she was best known as Prince\u2019s sister and worked to keep his legacy alive with his fans attending fan and industry events,\u201d President Nelson shared in a statement. \u201cServices will be private, and in lieu of flowers, the family has asked that you take care of one another.\u201d",
      "According to the Star Tribune, Nelson was scheduled to retire and perform a farewell concert at the Dakota in downtown Minneapolis in June. Illness caused her not to take the stage. A few days before the concert, she said she had a mixtape on the way and was working on a memoir.",
      "Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose in 2016 at his home in Minneapolis. He was 57. He had no will, and his six siblings inherited equal interests in the estate: Tyka Nelson and five half-siblings \u2014 Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John R. Nelson, Omarr Baker and Alfred Jackson.",
      "Tyka Nelson, Baker and Jackson, the three youngest, sold their stake to a music publishing company called Primary Wave Music, LLC, which later assigned its interests to an affiliate, Prince OAT Holdings LLC. Jackson has since died.",
      "Representatives for Paisley Park, Prince\u2019s private estate which is also a museum, studio, and concert venue in Chanhassen, Minnesota, did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment.",

      "Conservative podcaster Megyn Kelly delivered a fiery speech supporting Donald Trump before he gave what was billed as his \u201cclosing message.\"",
      "Conservative podcaster Megyn Kelly delivered a fiery speech supporting Donald Trump during an event billed as his \u201cclosing message\u201d on Monday night, a full-circle moment after the former president and the onetime Fox News star feuded bitterly during Trump's 2016 campaign.",
      "Invited to the stage in Pittsburgh, Kelly defended Trump against recent controversies, including his repeated pledge to be the \u201cprotector\u201d of women, and pressed his case on border security and his opposition to transgender athletes participating in sports.",
      "\u201cHe got mocked by the left by saying he would be a protector of women,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cHe will be a protector of women and it\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for him. He will close the border and he will keep the boys out of women\u2019s sports where they don\u2019t belong.\u201d",
      "Trump stood to the side, grinning and beaming, as he listened to the commentator he once called \u201cnasty.\u201d",
      "Afterward, she posted a selfie with the former president on X that was captioned in part: \"God bless him. Go vote for him!\"",
      "Kelly was a popular Fox News host in 2016 when she questioned Trump during the first debate of the Republican primary about whether he had the temperament to be president.",
      "Trump largely dismissed Kelly\u2019s question at the debate, but later he went directly after her, first overnight on Twitter and later in interviews.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not very tough and not very sharp,\u201d Trump told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI don\u2019t respect her as a journalist.\u201d",
      "Referring to Kelly\u2019s questions during the debate, Trump said, \u201cThere was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d The comment was widely viewed as a sexist reference to menstruation.",
      "Trump later boycotted another debate on Fox because Kelly was one of the moderators.",
      "Kelly left Fox for NBC News. She was taken off the air following an uproar when she suggested it was OK for white people to wear blackface on Halloween.",
      "She now hosts a SiriusXM satellite radio show that she has built into one of the highest-ranked on Chartable\u2019s list of news podcasts.",
      "\u201cAll that nonsense between us,\u201d Kelly said last year, \u201cis under the bridge.\u201d",
      "Kelly\u2019s appearance with Trump comes as early voting suggests a gender gap that favors Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Kelly was critical of some of the speakers who delivered crude and racist comments at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally last month. One suggested that Harris, who is vying to become the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to be elected president, began her career as a prostitute.",
      "The speakers, Kelly said, \u201ctook what was an amazing celebration of Trump, exciting and well-attended and hugely enthusiastic, and gave themselves a big black eye.\u201d"

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pop superstar Taylor Swift returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after wrapping up the U.S. leg of her record-setting Eras Tour.",
      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",
      "Swift is finally getting a chance to stop herself after playing the last of three shows at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Sunday to conclude the U.S. portion of her tour. The rest of her tour heads to Canada with the first of six shows at Rogers Centre in Toronto on Nov. 14 and three shows in December at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",
      "Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.",

      "PARIS -- As dusk falls over the City of Light, a new spectacle is illuminating Saint-Sulpice church, a monument whose interiors are even larger than Notre Dame's \u2014 and arguably just as breathtaking.",
      "The cavernous walls of the neoclassical gem on Paris' Left Bank are coming alive with 360-degree video projections, sparkling cutting-edge technology and actors, all telling the story of the church and its place in French history.",
      "Blending centuries of intrigue, revolution and family drama, the show reimagines the Saint-Germain district during the Fronde, the 17th-century civil war, and the lead-up to the French Revolution.",
      "\u201cParis C\u0153ur de Lumi\u00e8res\u201d (Paris Chancel of Lights), which runs until Nov. 23, transforms the church\u2019s sprawling 6,000-square-meter (65,000-square-foot) interior into a digital stage through advanced video mapping.",
      "\u201cFrom a technological standpoint, it\u2019s a laser scan of the entire building that allows us to reconstruct the space in three dimensions,\u201d director Damien Fontaine explained.",
      "\u201cWe then \u2018unfold\u2019 it like origami ... and put it back into 3D to be projected as a single unified image. We have over 45 projectors, each covering a part of the vaults, a section of a pillar, or a piece of the nave. It\u2019s ... a mosaic of images to form one large picture.\u201d",
      "Projections transform stone carvings into animated storytellers, while immersive soundscapes, paired with an original score, wrap the audience in a sensory experience.",
      "The actors brought history to life. Over 350 performers and volunteers, clad in more than 500 historical costumes, move among the audience portraying local families and rivalries, threading personal narratives into the broader history.",
      "Many of those who volunteered themselves marveled at learning about little known aspects of French history.",
      "Anne Dubosc, a 65-year-old amateur actress, played Anne of Austria, mother of Sun King Louis XIV.",
      "\u201cShe was a remarkable woman, very involved in politics and religion,\u201d Dubosc said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized how important she was. If Louis XIV became the man he was, it was partly thanks to this woman, this mother who was like a tigress, doing everything to protect her son and teaching him to be a great statesman.\u201d",
      "Performing in Saint-Sulpice, she added, was extraordinary: \u201cIt\u2019s exceptional. You lose track of what\u2019s happening, of where fiction ends and history begins.\u201d",
      "Her historic costume shaped her performance \u2014 literally.",
      "\u201cI have a corset that squeezes me so tightly,\u201d she said. \u201cYou realize there\u2019s a very 18th-century way of holding yourself, of carrying your shoulders and neck, which gives a natural majesty. The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.",

In Philadelphia, the finale of Harris' daylong dash across Pennsylvania, performers and presenters included DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe and Ricky Martin, while Gaga sang a soulful \u201cGod Bless America\u201d and Winfrey brought first-time voters to the stage.",

      "At his own rally in Pittsburgh, which overlapped with Harris' event in the city, the former president criticized Harris for one celebrity endorsement in particular: Beyonc\u00e9. He spoke dismissively about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s appearance at a Harris rally with Harris in Houston last month, drawing boos for the megastar from his supporters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 would come in. Everyone\u2019s expecting a couple of songs. There were no songs. There was no happiness,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Peter Ames Carlin writes a cultural history of the rock bank in \u201cThe Name of This Band is R",
      "The best way to read \u201cThe Name of This Band is R.E.M.\u201d is with a pair of headphones and a collection of the band's albums on streaming services or CDs. Opt for the cassettes or vinyl if you want to go old school.",
      "Peter Ames Carlin's book isn't just a cultural biography of the band going back to its formation in the-then sleepy college town of Athens, Georgia. It's also a poetic meditation on what made so many of the band's songs stand out, and continue to shine.",
      "\u201cIt was a new kind of post-punk, alternative music that straddled obscurity and directness, dissent and delicacy, unapologetic and unashamed pure pop,\u201d he writes about the reaction to the band's music in the early 1980s.",
      "Carlin's book offers plenty of behind the scenes details and trivia about R.E.M.'s rise. Fans will enjoy reading about how record executives were wary of making \u201cLosing My Religion,\u201d the band's iconic hit, the first single from its album \u201cOut of Time.\u201d",
      "It's also a fascinating history of a different era in music before social media created viral stars, when bands like R.E.M. rose up through college radio. The early sections of the book offer a vivid description of the music scene in Athens and the band's beginning.",
      "The book also explores the band's political activism, including their work on environmental causes and promotion of the Rock the Vote campaign.",
      "The band members didn't agree to interviews for Carlin's book, and that's one of the few weaknesses of what is an otherwise well-researched history. Anyone hoping to discover major new revelations about the band and its members will likely be disappointed, but Carlin ably demonstrates the impact R.E.M.'s music has had and why its history is worth revisiting.",

      "A former Denver elections worker has filed a federal lawsuit, alleging she was fired for speaking out on TV about her safety concerns",
      "DENVER -- A former Denver elections worker who says she was fired for speaking out about her safety concerns on comedian Jon Stewart's show filed a federal lawsuit Monday, alleging election officials wanted to silence her and violated her First Amendment rights.",
      "Virginia Chau, a lawyer who worked as a polling center supervisor during elections, spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart.\u201d",
      "Nationally, election officials have increased security in the lead-up to Election Day both to protect their workers and to protect voting procedures and ballots. Election offices and workers have been the target of harassment and threats since the 2020 presidential election, mainly by people supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him because of fraud.",
      "According to Chau's lawsuit, the Denver elections division director R. Todd Davidson told her she was being removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and said she could be a hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. The move would have been a demotion, the lawsuit said, and Chau refused to accept the new position.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez did not respond to Chau's request to reconsider her termination.",
      "\u201cInstead of heeding Ms. Chau\u2019s call for more resources and training for election officials facing threats to their personal safety, Defendants decided instead to retaliate against one of their best, and most passionate, election workers,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit was filed against the city, its elections director and clerk and recorder. It asks for Chau to be reinstated and for unspecified damages.",
      "A spokesperson for Lopez's office, Mikayla Ortega, and a representative of the city attorney's office, Melissa Sisneros, said their offices do not comment on pending litigation."

      "TOKYO -- Nintendo, the Japanese video game maker behind the Super Mario franchise, said Tuesday that its profit fell 60% in the first half of the fiscal year, as demand waned for its Switch console, now in its eighth year since going on sale.",
      "Kyoto-based Nintendo Co. reported a 108.7 billion yen ($715 million) profit for the April-September period, as sales slipped 34% from the previous year to 523 billion yen ($3.4 billion).",
      "More than 74% of its sales revenue came from overseas, according to Nintendo, which didn\u2019t break down quarterly numbers.",
      "Global Switch sales during the period dropped to 4.7 million machines from 6.8 million units the previous year.",
      "But Nintendo said in a statement that Switch sales were still growing and vowed to stick to its goal of selling a Switch console to each and every individual, not just one Switch per every household.",
      "Nintendo stuck to its earlier projection for a 300 billion yen ($2 billion) profit for the full fiscal year through March 2025, down nearly 29% from the previous fiscal year.",
      "Annual sales were forecast to drop 23% to1.28 trillion yen ($8.4 billion).",
      "It also lowered its Switch sales projection for the fiscal year to 12.5 million units from an earlier forecast to sell 13.5 million.",
      "Nintendo and other game and toy makers rake in their biggest profits during the Christmas shopping season, as well as New Year\u2019s, a holiday celebrated with fanfare in Japan, when children receive cash gifts from grandparents and other relatives.",
      "Nintendo has not yet announced details on a successor to the Switch.",
      "Among its million-seller game software titles for the fiscal half were \u201cPaper Mario RPG,\u201d which sold 1.95 million units since going on sale in May, and \u201cLuigi Mansion 2 HD,\u201d hitting nearly 1.6 million in sales.",
      "Overall, more than 70 million Switch games were sold during the period, for a total of nine titles that became million-sellers, including products from third-party manufacturers, or makers that aren\u2019t Nintendo.",
      "Still, that was down from more than 97 million games sold the previous year.",
      "The release of a Super Mario Brothers movie lifted sales in the previous fiscal year, while the absence of such a movie this fiscal year negatively impacted the latest results, Nintendo said. Revenue also declined in its mobile-game offerings and IP-related businesses, it said.",

      "DALLAS -- A pair of ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is on the auction block nearly two decades after a thief stole the iconic shoes, convinced they were adorned with real jewels.",
      "Online bidding has started and will continue through Dec. 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday.",
      "The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.",
      "That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018.",
      "Now the museum is among those vying for the slippers, which were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only four remain.",
      "Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival. The funds will supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to purchase the slippers.",
      "The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, was 76 when he was sentenced in January to time served because of his poor health. He admitting to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case in what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off \u201cone last score\u201d after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value.",

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is enjoying another weekend at the top of the box office charts",
      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d enjoyed another weekend at the top of the box office. The Sony release starring Tom Hardy added $26.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "It was a relatively quiet weekend for North American movie theaters leading up to the presidential election. Charts were dominated by big studio holdovers, like \u201cVenom 3,\u201d \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d and \u201cSmile 2,\u201d while audiences roundly rejected the Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Robert Zemeckis reunion \u201cHere.\u201d Thirty years after \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cHere\u201d opened to only $5 million from 2,647 locations.",
      "\u201cVenom 3\u201d only fell 49% in its second weekend, which is a notably small drop for a superhero film, though it didn\u2019t exactly open like one either. In two weeks, the movie has made over $90 million domestically; The first two opened to over $80 million. Globally, the picture is brighter given that it has already crossed the $300 million threshold.",
      "Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to attract moviegoers even six weeks in (and when it\u2019s available by video on demand), placing second with $7.6 million. That's up 11% from last weekend. The animated charmer has made over $121 million in North America and $269 million worldwide.",
      "\"'The Wild Robot' has quietly been this absolute juggernaut for the fall season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor that film to see an increase after six weeks is astounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile 2\u201d landed in third place with $6.8 million, helping to push its worldwide total to $109.7 million.",
      "The time-hopping \u201cHere,\u201d a graphic novel that was adapted by \u201cForrest Gump\u201d screenwriter Eric Roth, was financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony\u2019s TriStar. With a fixed position camera, it takes audiences through the years in one living room. Critics were not on board: In aggregate it has a lousy 36% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cIt was a slow weekend anyway, but it didn\u2019t resonate in a way that many thought it might,\" Dergarabedian said. \"There are a lot of films out there for the audience that \u2018Here\u2019 was chasing.\"",
      "Despite playing in almost 1,000 more locations, \u201cHere\u201d came in behind Focus Features' papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d which earned $5.3 million. Playing in 1,796 theaters, \u201cConclave\u201d dropped only 20% from its debut last weekend and has made $15.2 million so far. Two Indian films also cracked the top 10 in their debuts, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d and \u201cSingham Again.\u201d",
      "Overall box office continues to lag behind 2023 by almost 12%. But holiday moviegoing will likely give the industry an end-of-year boost with titles like \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d on the way.",
      "\u201cIn a couple of weeks, it\u2019ll get a lot more competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d a comedic drama about cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, launched in four theaters this weekend in New York and Los Angeles. It made an estimated $240,000, or $60,000 per screen, which is among the top three highest per theater averages of the year. Searchlight Pictures will be expanding the well-reviewed film nationwide in the coming weeks, going wide on Nov. 15 to over 800 theaters.",
      "Box office charts don\u2019t always paint a full picture of the moviegoing landscape, however. This weekend several relatively high-profile films playing in theaters did not report full grosses for various reasons, including the Clint Eastwood film \u201cJuror #2,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s WWII film \u201cBlitz\u201d and the Cannes darling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d Netflix, which is handling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d never reports box office. Apple Original Films is following suit with \u201cBlitz,\u201d a likely awards contender, which is in theaters before hitting Apple TV+ on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is a Warner Bros. release, and a well-reviewed one at that. The film directed by Eastwood stars Nicholas Hoult as a juror on a murder case who faces a big moral dilemma. Domestic ticket sales were withheld. The studio did say that it earned $5 million from international showings, where it played on 1,348 screens.",
      "Even major studios withhold box office numbers occasionally. Earlier this year, Disney did not report on the Daisy Ridley movie \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea.\u201d Results were most notably withheld during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It\u2019s really up to the distributors,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cOften times the reason that certain movies may not be reported is that there\u2019s a chance that the quality of the movie will be conflated with the box office number.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, were:",
      "1. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $26.1 million.",

      "After decades in romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career",
      "NEW YORK -- After some difficulties connecting to a Zoom, Hugh Grant eventually opts to just phone instead.",
      "\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he apologizes. \u201cTech hell.\u201d Grant is no lover of technology. Smart phones, for example, he calls the \u201cdevil\u2019s tinderbox.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re killing us. I hate them,\u201d he says. \u201cI go on long holidays from them, three or four days at at time. Marvelous.\u201d",
      "Hell, and our proximity to it, is a not unrelated topic to Grant\u2019s new film, \u201cHeretic.\u201d In it, two young Mormon missionaries (Chloe East, Sophie Thatcher) come knocking on a door they\u2019ll soon regret visiting. They\u2019re welcomed in by Mr. Reed (Grant), an initially charming man who tests their faith in theological debate, and then, in much worse things.",
      "After decades in romantic comedies, Grant has spent the last few years playing narcissists, weirdos and murders, often to the greatest acclaim of his career. But in \u201cHeretic,\u201d a horror thriller from A24, Grant\u2019s turn to the dark side reaches a new extreme. The actor who once charmingly stammered in \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d and who danced to the Pointer Sisters in \u201cLove Actually\u201d is now doing heinous things to young people in a basement.",
      "\u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d Grant says. \u201cI think human beings need challenges. It makes your beer taste better in the evening if you\u2019ve climbed a mountain. He was just so wonderfully (expletive)-up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHeretic,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, co-writers of \u201cA Quiet Place.\u201d In Grant\u2019s hands, Mr. Reed is a divinely good baddie \u2014 a scholarly creep whose wry monologues pull from a wide range of references, including, fittingly, Radiohead's \u201cCreep.\"",
      "In an interview, Grant spoke about these and other facets of his character, his journey from rom-com idol to horror villain and his abiding affection for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d",
      "GRANT: Yes, thank you. It\u2019s not easy for any actor.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s hard to remember which was the writers, which was me. But I\u2019m pretty sure doing the Jar Jar Binks impersonation was my idea.",
      "GRANT: No, I didn\u2019t. I just thought it would be fun if the character did that because it\u2019d be just weird. And, in fact, what\u2019s odd about me is that I\u2019ve never seen a \"Star Wars\u201d film.",
      "GRANT: I can\u2019t. They\u2019re too frightening for me. I watched \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d when I was too young and I\u2019ve been in counseling ever since. I watched one by mistake recently, which was \u201cMidsommar.\u201d I thought it looked like a jolly, Swedish comedy. I put it on one evening for my Swedish wife who needed cheering up and she\u2019s still very, very traumatized.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s fascinating, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know. Maybe these are the end of times, the end days, the apocalypse. We know it deep down but for some reason we won\u2019t confront it. I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s wonderful that it sends people into the cinemas.",
      "GRANT: It is. Talk about the end of days. To me, one of the gloomiest signs or omens is the gradual closing of cinemas \u2014 and not just that, where I live in London, but the closing of bars. The bar where I met my wife, which was party night every night of the week, is now largely closed. I think the fact that we\u2019re all staying in, staring at our devil\u2019s tinderboxes is deeply tragic, or watching things on streaming by ourselves with maybe one or two other family members. These things should be collective experiences.",
      "GRANT: My ability to gauge what\u2019s entertaining, I used to be very proud of it. In the old days, my old career, I used to say, \u201cI\u2019m not so proud of my acting but I\u2019m proud of the fact that the films I\u2019ve done, on the whole, have been entertaining and I\u2019ve been good at choosing them.\u201d And then, suddenly overnight, I became very bad at choosing them. I don\u2019t know, I lost the zeitgeist, I suppose. That can happen. Now, I feel like I\u2019ve found something again. If the character amuses me and I think I\u2019m going to enjoy being that person, then I tend to do the job. Sometimes, when actors are enjoying it, it works.",
      "GRANT: Yes, I\u2019ve got nothing else to go on. And I\u2019m not the lead character, the film doesn\u2019t rest on me. I don\u2019t have to worry that much if it does well, medium or badly. I just go by: Do I think I\u2019m going to have some fun in this?",
      "GRANT: The big shift was after \u201cDid You Hear About the Morgans?\u201d That was sort of officially the end of romantic comedy for me. Nothing much happened after that in showbiz terms. I went off and did political campaigning and I was quite happy, in fact. But in drips and drabs, strange little projects, like the Wachowskis' \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d then Stephen Fears came along with \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins\u201d and \u201cA Very English Scandal.\u201d \u201cPaddington 2.\u201d These interesting, complex, often not very nice, narcissistic weirdos started to emerge from the woods.",
      "GRANT: Looking back, I was very lucky. I had Richard Curtis on the one hand, who is not only a gifted comic writer \u2013 he can just do flat-out comedy like \u201cBlack Adder\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s an unrecognized dramatist. Those comedies are based on pain. The comedy is there to deal with pain. It\u2019s people with unrequited love, lost love, bereavement, brothers with mental illness \u2014 proper pain. So I was lucky with him.",
      "And I think I was very lucky with Marc Lawrence who just had a wonderful gift for the celebration of life. He actually likes people, which is so weird. So films like \u201cMusic and Lyrics\u201d have a very sustaining and uplifting buoyancy to them. He\u2019s an unrecognized talent.",
      "GRANT: You know who really loves them? The most surprising person in the world. Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino pushed his way through a crowd at a party in London once to say, (does Tarantino impression) \u201cMan, I loved \u2018Music and Lyrics\u2019 and \u2018Two Weeks Notice.\u2019\u201d He told me the whole plot of both films and how he was watching one of them on a plane and the plane landed and he had to rush off to a DVD shop to buy the disc so he could watch the end of it. I thought maybe he was joking but I don\u2019t think he was. Someone told me at his cinema here in Hollywood, a rather cool, 35mm-showing theater, he\u2019s been showing \u201cMusic and Lyrics,\u201d no less.",
      "GRANT: Yes, my enthusiasm for that film has spread. I\u2019ve just been invited to a 60th anniversary next year in Salzburg. I might go. I might wear lederhosen. Or I might wear a white dress with a blue satin sash, as I did in school when I played Brigitta Von Trapp.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, I was at all-boys English school and I played, I think, the third youngest daughter.",
      "GRANT: The older I get the more I love song and dance. I find myself watching a lot more Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, things like that. Because life is so stressful and the news is so ghastly that it\u2019s hard to watch very serious stuff and pick yourself up afterwards. I did watch \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d coming over from London the other day. And I have to say that\u2019s just about as good as filmmaking gets. Short of \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d obviously.",
      "GRANT: Yes, weirdly it has, and it\u2019s hard to say why. Is it a sort of exorcism or something? I don\u2019t know. Way back in my 20s, when I started out acting, the only thing I thought I could ever bring to entertainment was doing silly characters, doing voices. I did them as a kid to the point where I drove people mad. I was never myself. My parents and my school teachers used to say, \u201cCome on, just drop it. Who\u2019s the real Hugh Grant?\u201d So it was a bit weird to have a career as a leading-man romantic comedies where I didn\u2019t get to be anyone unusual or weird. So I feel like this is something I can do, and quite like doing. At the same time, I learned some tricks of film acting and got a little bit better.",
      "GRANT: The big thing for me was I learned to trust myself a bit more when you\u2019re actually in front of the camera. There\u2019s a terrible danger when people do film acting. They\u2019re so frightened of this big, pressure moment that\u2019s coming up that they sort of pre-rehearse and think, \u201cI\u2019m going to say the line this way, and it\u2019s excellent that way, and I shall just try to reproduce that on the day.\u201d But that\u2019s no good. You\u2019ve got to reinvent it on the day.",
      "The prep work should not be how you\u2019re going to say the lines, the prep work should be \u2014 well, for me, anyway \u2014 a kind of absurdly prolonged in-depth marinade like a piece of old meat that you leave soaking for weeks and months in sauce until it\u2019s full of flavor. So my marinade takes the form of very, very painstaking, minute examination of the script: Why do I say this? Why do I do this? What happened in childhood for this person to behave like this? What was his mother like? What was his father like?",
      "In the case of Mr. Reed in \u201cHeretic,\u201d it\u2019d be: Let\u2019s look at some serial killers. Let\u2019s look at some cult leaders. Let\u2019s look at some atheists. It\u2019s funny how important costume is. Suddenly some thing, one thing, one visual, physical thing makes you go: That\u2019s him. With Mr. Reed it was the idea of double denim. I don\u2019t actually wear double denim in the film but I realized, yes, he\u2019s Mr. Double Denim. He thinks he\u2019s a groovy teacher at university, the one who\u2019s down with the kids, making jokes.",
      "GRANT: Yeah, that\u2019s true. But doing it on those romantic comedies, I\u2019m not sure I really got anywhere particularly. I wasn\u2019t really creating monsters. It\u2019s easier when you\u2019re creating monsters. I\u2019m fascinated by the bizarre, weird distortions that human beings twist themselves into emotionally, intellectually, physically from the trials and tribulations of life. I\u2019m not sure that any of my characters in the romantic comedies were sufficiently twisted to fully get my juices flowing.",
      "GRANT: Not necessarily from the point of view of religion. But there is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit. My mother did it. She didn\u2019t like me or my brother being too up and she\u2019d find some way to bring us back to ground level.",
      "GRANT: I agree.",
      "GRANT: It\u2019s a very good question that I do not have the answer to. As a matter of fact, there is one thing sitting on my desk in the other room here which is pretty weird and relatively fresh. I agree, I\u2019m not quite sure where to go from here. Maybe it\u2019s song and dance."

      "To mark 30 years of his career, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has released a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring previously released and new collaborations across some of his best-known work",
      "NEW YORK -- It's one of the most immediately recognizable voices on the planet: Andrea Bocelli's tenor is beloved across generations, cultures and borders, known to induce tears in as few as three simple words: \u201cCon Te Partir\u00f2,\u201d or in its English performance, \u201cTime to Say Goodbye.\u201d",
      "This year, he's celebrating the 30th anniversary of his career with a new compilation album, \u201cDuets,\u201d featuring both previously released and brand-new collaborations of his best-known work \u2014 as well as a few surprising contemporary covers \u2014 and the release of a new concert film, \u201cAndrea Bocelli 30: The Celebration,\u201d which will arrive in theaters on Friday.",
      "So, why duets?",
      "\u201cI've loved voices since when I was a child, and I like very much to share the stage with the best artists and voices. So, this album, there are the best duets that I did in my life,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cFrom the first, \u2018The Prayer\u2019 with Celine Dion, until the last, like \u2018Perfect\u2019 with Ed Sheeran and many, many others. And the album has been remastered and remixed. So, I hope the sound can be better.\"",
      "He says: \u201cThe most important thing in voices... is to be recognizable, to give emotion.\"",
      "Sheeran was an interesting collaboration because when Bocelli first attempted to sing \u201cPerfect,\" the English singer-songwriter wasn't a fan. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like what I did because I sang in a pop style,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe wanted to listen to my voice, like in an operatic style.\u201d So, Sheeran traveled to Bocelli's home in Tuscany, and the song was transformed. \u201cHe was right because this song had a huge success.\u201d",
      "When asked if there is anyone he would've loved to add to the \u201cDuets\u201d collection, Bocelli says of course \u2014 but \u201cthey passed away before I began to sing. For example, I would like very much to sing with Maria Callas or (Renata) Tebaldi or Magda Olivero. Many great, incredible singers. They are not anymore with us, unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Three decades into his career, Bocelli has performed for presidents, popes, and sold-out stadiums across the globe \u2014 in addition to having sold nearly 90 million records worldwide, according to a press release. \u201cReality exceeded my wildest dreams,\u201d he says.",
      "How he reflects on that time should come as no surprise. \u201cI like to sing to the future. Honestly, I don\u2019t like to think with nostalgia to the past,\" he says. \u201cMy first time on stage, for me it is like yesterday. The time is gone so quickly, so fast. And, yeah, now I like to think to the future.\u201d",
      "So, what, then, does he hope becomes his legacy in the next 30 years, 300 years? \u201cIn Italy, we have a very famous expression: The people that come after us will judge us,\u201d he says with a translator. \u201cSo I can\u2019t force the judge(ment) of the people. But I feel that my audience has a big affection for me, and this is my goal. When somebody in the street comes to me and says (to) me, \u2018Thank you for your voice, for your music,\u2019 I think mission is accomplished.\"",
      "Across \u201cDuets,\u201d Bocelli sings in Italian, English, French and Spanish. \u201cThere are many languages, but it\u2019s so difficult. I remember the day I tried to sing in Chinese, only few lines, but it has been so hard for me,\u201d he laughs.",
      "He also performs across genres, working with everyone from Latin superstars like Karol G and Jennifer Lopez to country musicians like Chris Stapleton and Shania Twain. \u201cI would like to try to sing jazz,\" he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s too difficult for me because you must live in an atmosphere, to learn step by step, day by day. I like jazz but it\u2019s too far from the experience of my life.\u201d",
      "There is little he hasn't done across these last three decades, but the ultimate goal now, he says, is steeped in faith. \u201cI have been very lucky and I reached the affection of the people. Now I must try to deserve the affection of the God. It\u2019s more difficult.\"",
      "But he will continue to perform for those who love him. On Dec. 4, Bocelli's U.S. tour kicks off in San Diego and runs through the month, before commencing again in February and June 2025. The final dates will be held in Napa Valley, California, on June 21 and 22."

    "summary": "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",

      "Quincy Jones has died at age 91",
      "Quincy Jones, the multitalented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson\u2019s historic \u201cThriller\u201d album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones\u2019 publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. Jones was to have received an honorary Academy Award later this month.",
      "\u201cTonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones\u2019 passing,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cAnd although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.\u201d",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and leaving behind a vast musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American song and rhythm. Over the past half century, it was hard to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with Jones\u2019 name on it or someone in the music, television or movie industries who did not have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cIn the Heat of the Night,\u201d organized President Clinton\u2019s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \u201cWe Are the World.\u201d",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, singling out any work seems unfair. But honors likely go to his productions with Jackson on \u201cOff the Wall,\u201d \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cBad,\u201d albums universal in their style and appeal. Jones\u2019 versatility and imagination fit perfectly with the bursting talents of Jackson as he sensationally transformed from child star to the \u201cKing of Pop.\u201d On such classic tracks as \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and \u201cWanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019,\u201d Jones and Jackson drew upon disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \u201cThriller,\u201d some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-defying \u201cBeat It\u201d and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\u201cThriller\u201d sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone, helped Jackson become the first major Black artist to have a video played on MTV and influenced countless performers.",
      "\u201cMichael had the look and the voice, and I had every sound you can think of,\u201d Jones would explain.",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \u201cQ\u201d: 28 Grammys (out of 80 nominations), an honorary Academy Award and an Emmy for \u201cRoots.\u201d He also received France\u2019s Legion d\u2019Honneur and the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy. In 2001, Jones was named a Kennedy Center Honoree for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \u201cListen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones,\u201d and his memoir made him a bestselling author.",
      "\u201cDespite all the Grammys and the special awards and testimonials that maturity bestows, it will always be the values you carry within yourself \u2014 of work, love, and integrity \u2014 that carry the greatest worth, because these are what get you through with your dreams intact, your heart held firm and your spirit ready for another day,\u201d he wrote in his book.",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, telling Oprah Winfrey that \u201cThere are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s in between.\u201d Jones\u2019 mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \u201csenseless\u201d for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "Music was his passion, and, almost literally, his salvation. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\u201cI went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cThat\u2019s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\u201d",
      "Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\u201cWe had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\u201d Jones later told Musician magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\u201d",
      "His survivors include actor Rashida Jones and five other daughters: Jolie Jones Levine, Rachel Jones, Martina Jones, Kidada Jones and Kenya Kinski-Jones; son Quincy Jones III; brother Richard Jones and sisters Theresa Frank and Margie Jay.",

      "Three clucks to Sy Montgomery, who 14 years after publishing \u201cBirdology,\u201d is still finding ways to make money off the charming stories she told in that book about various avian species. \u201cWhat the Chicken Knows,\u201d subtitled \u201cA New Appreciation of the World\u2019s Most Familiar Bird\u201d was a chapter in \u201cBirdology,\u201d but is being re-released as a mini hardcover.",
      "Readers who haven\u2019t read it will be, briefly, captivated. In just 67 pages (16 of which are glossy color photographs) Montgomery introduces us to her \u201cLadies,\u201d the ever-changing flock of hens she raised on her New Hampshire farm for decades starting in the 1980\u2019s. Blending her personal experiences as queen of the coop with everything you\u2019ve ever wanted to know about chicken behavior, it\u2019s a fun and informative way to spend an hour.",
      "Here\u2019s a sampling of what you\u2019ll learn: Chickens outnumber people 4:1, they have more in common, anatomically, with dinosaurs than humans, you can mail order up to 350 different varieties of chicks, and roosters really are much meaner than hens. Montgomery sprinkles in those facts and plenty more as she shares stories about how her chickens behaved over the years and what they taught her about \u201chow rich and varied their lives are, as fraught and joyous and changeable as our own.\u201d",
      "Montgomery is wary of anthropomorphizing her feathered friends, so while she names them, she also tells plenty of stories that could be rebranded for a TV show called \u201cWhen Chickens Attack!\u201d The funniest involves her minister, who makes the mistake of running his hand down one of the hens\u2019 backs, a gesture that makes them assume a distinctive mating crouch. Across the yard, Alex \u201csaw a moral travesty, an insult to his roosterhood: the minister was trying to have sex with his hen.\u201d The minister survives the bloody \u201cspurs first\u201d attack to the back of his calves, but learns to tend his own flock.",
      "\u201cWhat the Chicken Knows\u201d joins \u201cA Hummingbird\u2019s Gift\u201d and \u201cThe Hawk\u2019s Way\u201d as standalone mini-books pulled from the pages of \u201cBirdology.\u201d Each has a new introduction by the author and would make nice stocking stuffers for bird lovers in anyone\u2019s life.",

      "LONDON -- British prosecutors say they have been given a file of evidence from police about alleged sexual offenses by comedian Russell Brand and are considering whether to charge him.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service said late Saturday that \u201cwe have been passed a file by the police to consider a charging decision in this case. Any decision to charge is made independently, based on the evidence and in line with our legal test.\u201d",

      "In September 2023, British media outlets Channel 4 and the Sunday Times published claims by four women of being sexually assaulted or raped by Brand between 2006 and 2013, at the height of his fame. The accusers have not been identified.",

My life changed forever for the better after meeting him. I had never experienced, nor have since, anyone who\u2019s heart was so filled with love. He walked around with his heart wide open, and he treated everybody as if they were the most important person he\u2019d ever met. He was the Light. No shadows. He was love lived out loud in human form and he was the first person I ever loved unconditionally.

He was friends with George Martin, the Beatles\u2019 producer and, between the two of them, produced some very fine music. Quincy or \u2018Quince\u2019 or \u2018Q\u2019, as he was known, always had a twinkle in his eye and had a very positive, loving spirit which infected everyone who knew him. His work with Michael Jackson is, of course, legendary and he had so many other strings to his musical bow,\u201d Paul McCartney on Instagram.",

Forever inspired by the incomparable Quincy Jones,\u201d Dr. Dre, on Instagram.",

      "The orchestra said Monday it issued a notice of non-reengagement to the two effective Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "Wang and Muckey were fired in September 2018 following allegations of misconduct dating to 2010. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians filed a grievance and the two were ordered reinstated in April 2020 by arbitrator Richard I. Bloch. Both men deny any wrongdoing.",
      "New York Magazine in April detailed allegations and the two were placed on paid leave. They then sued the orchestra and the union.",
      "Local 802's executive board said in a nine-page decision issued Tuesday that every member of the orchestra's nine-member dismissal review committee \u201cexpressed revulsion at the abuse of power and pattern of behavior.\u201d",
      "Philharmonic executive adviser Deborah Borda said 11 women made accusations against Wang and three against Muckey during the latest investigation.",
      "\u201cIt found that both gentlemen had been involved in sexual abuse and rape as well as abuse of power,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThis is all new information that came out and I think the reason is that people were afraid to speak up before and they are not now.\u201d",
      "Borda said some of the allegations were made by students.",
      "Steven J. Hyman, a lawyer for Muckey, accused the union of a \"baseless smear campaign, ignoring clear evidence to the contrary.\"",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is deeply troubling and raises serious questions about potential collusion with the philharmonic in their effort to terminate Matthew Muckey without just cause,\u201d Hyman said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThey reference an alleged encounter from 2008 with a young woman, claiming she did not provide meaningful consent; however, contemporaneous text messages directly contradict this allegation.\u201d",
      "Alan S. Lewis, a lawyer for Wang, called the union's decision \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cTroublingly, the philharmonic has gone down the road of public character assassination instead of due process, throwing a lot of mud against the wall to see what sticks,\u201d he wrote Monday in an email to The Associated Press. Lewis described the most serious allegation against Wang involving a person unaffiliated with the orchestra and \"with whom, more than a decade ago, Liang had a long-term consensual relationship.\u201d",
      "He called the other allegations against Wang false.",
      "The philharmonic this spring hired Tracey Levy of Levy Employment Law to investigate and issued a letter of non-re-engagement on Oct. 15 following Levy\u2019s conclusions that the orchestra said were based on new accusations. Muckey said in his lawsuit the New York Magazine story contained \"a reiteration of the same 2010 allegations.\"",
      "The guild's executive committee decision said in Wang's case 11 witnesses \u201ctestified to specific instances of rape, sexual assault, grooming of a young female musician, inappropriate touching and comments, unwelcome kissing, and other sexually harassing behavior.\u201d",
      "The report said a woman six years younger than Muckey testified they \u201chad sex when she was 18 years old and was too incapacitated by alcohol to voluntarily consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile the allegations concerning Muckey are not as numerous as those involving Wang, we cannot ignore the fact that they demonstrate a similar abuse of power and failure to acknowledge the importance of a woman\u2019s consent to sexual relations,\u201d the report said.",
      "Under the orchestra\u2019s labor contract, the philharmonic must give notice of a non-reengagement by the Feb. 15 prior to the season in question. The two had the right to contest the decision, which the orchestra said must be \u201cappropriate\u201d under the collective bargaining agreement instead of a \u201cjust cause\u201d standard.",
      "\u201cLocal 802\u2019s decision is not to arbitrate the termination,\u201d local 802 president Sara Cutler wrote in an email to the orchestra members on Monday.",
      "The executive board's unanimous report said it was not determining whether criminal conduct took place but only \u201cwhether the notices of non-reengagement were appropriate.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsidering the 11 witnesses who testified about Wang\u2019s pattern of sexual violence and harassment over many years, we do not credit his denials or failure to remember these events,\u201d the report said. \u201cWith respect to Muckey, we similarly do not find his denials sufficient to overcome the testimony of the witness whom the investigator found credible and the pattern of conduct she described. Additionally, the lack of any contrition and the absence of any empathy shown towards the victims reinforces our view that the dismissal was appropriate.\u201d",
      "The report said two-thirds of the orchestra members had said they would refuse to appear on stage with the two.",
      "Muckey was hired by the orchestra in June 2006 and was given tenure in January 2008. Wang was hired as principal oboe in September 2006.",
      "\u201cThey are barred from the building,\u201d Borda said. \u201cThey will never appear on the stage again with the philharmonic.\u201d"

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the hospitality industry had \u201ctaken a real battering in recent years\u201d and it is not \u201cthe right time\u201d to ban smoking outside pubs.",
      "The bill also proposes to restrict vape flavors and ban bright vape packaging aimed at children, to combat \u201ca cynical industry that has sought to addict a new generation of children to nicotine,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "It also continues a plan by the previous Conservative government, which was ousted in July\u2019s general election, to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco by one year each year, so that no one born after Jan. 1, 2009 will ever be able to buy cigarettes legally in Britain.",
      "It is currently illegal to sell cigarettes, tobacco products or vapes to people under 18.",
      "If passed \u2013 as is likely because of the governing Labour Party\u2019s large majority in Parliament -- the bill would give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world.",
      "The government said the bill \u201cbreaks the cycle of addiction and paves the way for a smoke-free U.K.\u201d",
      "The number of people who smoke in Britain has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people \u2014 or about 13% of the population \u2014 still smoke, according to official figures.",
      "Authorities say smoking causes some 80,000 deaths a year in the U.K, and remains the number one preventable cause of death, disability and poor health."

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

      "Orlando Harris\u2019 family pleaded with Missouri police to confiscate the 19-year-old\u2019s bullet-proof vest, ammunition and AR-15-style rifle. They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",
      "Nine days later, Harris entered his former St. Louis high school and declared, \u201cAll of you are going to die.\u201d",
      "A new 456-page police report details the efforts Harris' family took to try to take his gun away in the days before he walked into Central Visual Arts and Performing Arts High School on Oct. 24, 2022, when he killed a student and a teacher and wounded seven others before he was fatally shot by police.",
      "Missouri is not among the 21 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, red-flag laws are intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else.",
      "The case highlights how hard it is for law enforcement to restrict gun access, even when there are clues something is deeply amiss.",
      "After an Army reservist killed 18 people in October 2023 in Lewiston, Maine, an investigation found missed opportunities to intervene in the shooter\u2019s psychiatric crisis. And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",

      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "The last three hospitals still partially functioning in northern Gaza have been encircled by Israeli troops and caught amid fighting for weeks",
      "JERUSALEM -- They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire.",
      "Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare.",
      "All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area.",
      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes.",
      "It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as \u201ccommand and control bases\u201d to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals.",
      "\u201cIf we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids.",
      "Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed.",
      "But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials.",
      "It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events.",
      "The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman\u2019s office did not reply.",
      "In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said.",
      "As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives.",
      "\u201cWe are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,\u201d Salha said. \u201cWe have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.\u201d",
      "The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties.",
      "Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient\u2019s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates.",
      "Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila\u2019s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said.",
      "By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became \u201ca death sentence,\u201d Obeid said.",
      "Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds.",
      "Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. \u201cCivilians!\u201d her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir.",
      "On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding.",
      "\u201cThe humiliation scared me more than death,\u201d Khalidi said.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza\u2019s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May.",
      "In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks.",
      "\u201cWhoever stays until the end will tell the story,\u201d it read in English. \u201cWe did what we could. Remember us.\u201d",
      "Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe bombing around us has increased. They\u2019ve paralyzed us,\" said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer.",
      "Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories.",
      "Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. \u201cPeople come to me to save them. \u2026 I can\u2019t do that by myself, with two doctors,\u201d he said in a voice message, his voice weak. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals.",
      "The Indonesian is Northern Gaza\u2019s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble \u2014 all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023.",
      "Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound.",
      "The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. \u201cIf there\u2019s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month.",
      "After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply.",
      "It released images of two vehicles found in the compound \u2014 a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment.",
      "During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian\u2019s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to \u201cenemy fire\u201d from the hospital but denied using shells.",
      "Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it.",
      "For three weeks, wounded poured in \u2014 up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn\u2019t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling.",
      "Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground.",
      "\u201cTo see patients dying before your eyes because you don\u2019t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: \u2018Where is humanity?\u2019\u201d asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer.",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza\u2019s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week.",
      "Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital\u2019s director, Hossam Abu Safiya.",
      "In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes.",
      "\u201cEverything we have built, they have burned,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThey burned our hearts. They killed my son.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital\u2019s oxygen tanks because they \u201ccan be booby traps,\u201d the official said.",
      "Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working.",
      "Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya\u2019s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia.",
      "The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were \u201cposing as medical staff.\u201d Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was \"fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.\u201d It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital.",
      "Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan.",
      "The turmoil echoed Israel\u2019s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man\u2019s finger.",
      "Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. \u201cEvery time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,\u201d said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained.",
      "The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants.",
      "As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. \u201cI thought, this makes no sense \u2014 who would they be shooting at?\u201d",
      "Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside.",
      "After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs.",
      "Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office said: \u201cLies were spread on social media\u201d about troops\u2019 activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military\u2019s activities.",
      "Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress.",
      "Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals \u201cprovide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.\u201d He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. \u201cAnd when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.\u201d",
      "Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided \u2014 one leading to Shifa's grounds.",
      "In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that \u201cIsrael has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.\u201d It described Israeli actions at hospitals as \u201ccollective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. \u201cThey are places of death,\u201d Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. \u201cYou can feel it.\u201d",
      "Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed.",

      "Robert F",
      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent proponent of debunked public health claims whom Donald Trump has promised to put in charge of health initiatives, said Saturday that Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water on his first day in office if elected president.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water has long been considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Kennedy made the declaration Saturday on the social media platform X alongside a variety of claims about the heath effects of fluoride.",
      "\u201cOn January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S\u200b. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, \u201cwant to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, \u201cbut it sounds OK to me. You know it\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, \"He\u2019s going to have a big role in the administration.\u201d",
      "Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as \"a very talented guy and has strong views.\u201d",
      "The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump\u2019s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health.",
      "In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say.",
      "Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.",
      "In August, a federal agency determined \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it\u2019s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn\u2019t say what those measures should be.",
      "In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture.",
      "But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: \u201cYou can work on food, you can work on anything you want\" except oil policy.",
      "\u201cHe wants health, he wants women\u2019s health, he wants men\u2019s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,\" Trump added."

      "Maryland is the first state to sign an agreement with the federal government designed to improve health care and lower costs",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland became the first state on Friday to join a federal program designed to improve health care quality and equity while lowering costs for all health care payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers.",
      "It builds on Maryland\u2019s Total Cost of Care Model, which sets a per capita limit on Medicare\u2019s total cost of care in Maryland and encompasses the state\u2019s unique all-payer hospital payment system, which reduces per capita hospital expenditures and supports improved health outcomes, as encouraged by the Affordable Care Act.",
      "This new federal framework, known as the AHEAD model, has been designed to deliver high-quality health care through greater coordination, with a focus on health equity and social needs to support underserved patients.",
      "\u201cThe AHEAD model is the next chapter in health care, so we are proud to be writing that new chapter right here in the state of Maryland,\u201d said Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat who signed the agreement with U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure.",
      "Since the 1970s, Maryland has had a hospital all-payer system that enables the state to set its own rates for hospital services, and all payers must charge the same rate for services at a given hospital.",
      "It\u2019s designed to provide equitable access to care, eliminate the need for charity hospitals and ensure patients are treated the same regardless of insurance status. State law authorizes the system, which bases costs on rates set by hospitals. It has continued to be the foundation of each subsequent evolution of the Maryland health care model.",
      "\u201cMaryland has this unique system that we\u2019ve developed over a period of decades now,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, told reporters after a news conference in Annapolis. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it to the next level by signing this AHEAD agreement, and the bottom line is it helps us accomplish three top priorities: equity, quality, affordability. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d",
      "The Maryland Department of Health will now begin planning to implement the AHEAD model starting Jan. 1, 2025. That will include establishing targets for cost growth, quality and equity improvements, population health, and primary care investments as well as identifying regional partnerships to drive AHEAD goals.",
      "Sen. Ben Cardin said the agreement keeps in place state policy that health care providers receive the same pay for services, so hospitals have incentives to provide equal care, whether you have private insurance, government insurance, or no insurance.",
      "\u201cSecondly, we are now committed to making sure that we have the most effective quality care,\u201d said Cardin, a Democrat. \u201cSo, we invest in primary care. We invest in early detection, prevention, so that we can keep you healthier, so you don\u2019t have to spend as much time with health care needs.\u201d",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has selected five other states \u2014 Vermont, Connecticut, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and regions of New York\u2014 for participation in the AHEAD Model.",
      "\u201cMaryland\u2019s participation in the AHEAD Model is a critical step forward in improving the overall health of its residents, supporting primary care, transforming health care in communities throughout the state, and addressing disparities in the health care system,\u201d Brooks-LaSure said."

      "Louisiana\u2019s new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as controlled dangerous substances is being challenged in a state court lawsuit by a physician, a pharmacist, two women who had difficult pregnancies and others",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana's new law categorizing two widely used abortion drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances\u201d was challenged in a state court lawsuit Thursday by a physician, a pharmacist and others who say the legislation sets up needless, dangerous delays in treatment during medical emergencies.",
      "Although there already was a near-total abortion ban in Louisiana, including by medication, the reclassification of the drugs \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol, which have other critical reproductive health care uses \u2014 went into effect earlier this month. Proponents of the law said more oversight and control over the drugs was needed to prevent coerced abortions. They have used as an example a Texas case in which a pregnant woman was given seven misoprostol pills by her husband without her knowledge. The baby survived.",
      "Doctors critical of the law have said it could harm patients facing emergency complications such as postpartum hemorrhages by requiring medical personnel to go through extra steps and more stringent storage requirements to use the drugs.",
      "\u201cEven short delays in accessing misoprostol can be life-threatening for postpartum hemorrhage patients,\u201d says the lawsuit. It says the law violates the Louisiana Constitution in multiple ways, including a prohibition on discrimination based on a person's physical condition.",
      "Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill said she had not seen the lawsuit as of Thursday afternoon. \u201cI can\u2019t respond to a lawsuit we have not seen, but I\u2019m confident this law is constitutional,\" she said in a statement. \"We will vigorously defend it.\u201d",
      "In addition to the physician and the pharmacist, who the lawsuit says is pregnant, the plaintiffs in the case include the Birthmark Doula Collective, an organization of people trained to provide pregnancy care before, during and after birth.",
      "Other plaintiffs include Nancy Davis, a woman who was denied an abortion in Louisiana and traveled out of state for one after learning her fetus would not survive. A woman who said she was turned away from two emergency rooms instead of being treated for a miscarriage is also part of the lawsuit.",
      "Prior to the reclassification, a prescription was still needed to obtain mifepristone and misoprostol in Louisiana. The new law reclassified the pills as \u201cSchedule IV drugs,\u201d putting them in the same category as the opioid tramadol and other substances that can be addictive.",
      "The new classification means that if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years.",
      "The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "The legislation is a first-of-its-kind law in the U.S. While GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, many Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion groups have touted the new classification, doctors have warned of deadly delays that the law could cause.",
      "Under the new classification, doctors say there are extra steps and more stringent storage requirements, which could slow access to the drugs in emergency situations. Beyond inducing abortions, the pills are also used to treat miscarriages, induce labor and stop hemorrhaging.",
      "Prior to the law, some doctors said that misoprostol would be stored in a box in the hospital room, on the delivery table or in a nurse's pocket. But under the new requirements of the classification, the drugs may be down the hall in a locked container or potentially in-house pharmacy at smaller hospitals.",

      "\u201cProviding affordable access to health care for low-income workers is a smart investment in our workforce, and it is exactly the business-minded approach that all of you would take in your own individual businesses,\u201d White said.",
      "The three-month legislative session begins in early January.",
      "White said some of his other big goals for the session are phasing out the state income tax, reducing the 7% sales tax on groceries and enacting a plan to let children attend public schools outside the districts where they live.",
      "Hosemann said the Senate will propose a reduction in the grocery tax. He did not list a phase-out of the income tax or a school choice plan among his policy priorities. He mentioned that Mississippi is already in a years-long process of reducing its personal income tax under a law enacted in 2022."

      "QUETTA, Pakistan -- A powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in restive southwest Pakistan on Friday, killing nine people including five nearby children, and wounding 17 other people, officials said.",
      "Local police chief Fateh Mohammad said the attack occurred in Mastung, a district in Balochistan province. He said a motorized rickshaw carrying schoolchildren was nearby when the bombing happened, resulting in the deaths of five children, a police officer and two passersby.",
      "Some of the wounded were moved to a hospital in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, said Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department. He said seven people died on the spot, while two men who had been critically wounded died at a hospital.",
      "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on police, but suspicion is likely to fall on separatist groups and Pakistani Taliban that have stepped up attacks on security forces and civilians in recent months.",
      "The police chief in Mastung, Rehmat Ullah, said a police van came under attack when it was heading to a health center to escort polio workers for the door-to-door campaign that began on Monday to vaccinate 45 million children under 5, following a surge in new cases.",
      "Pakistan has recorded 41 polio cases across 71 districts so far this year.",
      "The latest attack came days after militants attacked a health center used in the ongoing anti-polio campaign in northwestern district of Orakzai, triggering a shootout that left two policemen dead. Three of the attackers were also killed in the exchange of fire.",
      "Militants in Pakistan often target police and health workers during campaigns against polio, claiming the vaccination drives are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where the spread of polio has never been stopped.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief minister of Balochistan, Sarfraz Bugti, both denounced the bombing and vowed to continue the war against insurgents until they are eliminated from the country.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and urging the government to investigate and ensure those responsible are brought to justice and held accountable, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.",
      "Balochistan is the site of a long-running insurgency, with an array of separatist groups staging attacks mainly on security forces. The groups, including the Baloch Liberation Army, demand independence from the central government.",
      "The BLA has also attacked foreigners. Last month, it claimed responsibility for a bombing that targeted Chinese nationals outside an airport in the southern city of Karachi, killing two workers from China and wounding eight people.",
      "Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects.",

      "Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Thursday expressed her surprise over the ambassador's remarks, saying that Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the seminar, had said \u201cPakistan is committed to providing full security to Chinese nationals, projects and institutions in Pakistan. Our commitment has been conveyed at the senior most levels of the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "She said Jiang's statement was \u201cperplexing in view of the positive diplomatic traditions.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for one year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research",
      "Some people who took a new schizophrenia drug for a year improved with only a few side effects, but many dropped out of the research, the company announced Thursday.",
      "The results underscore the difficulties in treating schizophrenia, a severe mental illness that can cause people to hear voices, feel paranoid and withdraw from others. High dropout rates are typical in schizophrenia drug studies.",
      "Finding a drug that works can be a long ordeal punctuated by crises and hospitalizations. Side effects of existing medications \u2014 weight gain, tremors, restlessness \u2014 cause some people to stop taking medicine and relapse.",
      "There's been great hope among doctors for Cobenfy, which was approved in September, because it acts in the brain differently than other schizophrenia drugs. Instead of blocking dopamine receptors, Cobenfy\u2019s main ingredient, xanomeline, works on a different receptor that indirectly blocks dopamine release.",
      "Cobenfy also contains trospium, which blocks some of the side effects. The most common are nausea, vomiting and indigestion. In contrast to the weight gain seen with other schizophrenia drugs, people lost a few pounds while taking Cobenfy, made by Bristol Myers Squibb.",
      "Dr. John Krystal of Yale University has led research on other schizophrenia drugs but was not involved in the new studies. He noted that just 10% to 20% of participants in the new studies dropped out because of side effects.",
      "\u201cThat is pretty good,\u201d he said, noting that fewer or milder side effects could mean people will stay in treatment longer. That could mean fewer problems associated with untreated mental illness: substance use, homelessness and unemployment.",
      "So why did some patients stick with treatment while others dropped out? Krystal said it will be important to understand more about that as doctors start prescribing the drug.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved Cobenfy on the strength of two encouraging company-sponsored five-week trials and other safety data. The latest results announced Thursday at the Psych Congress meeting in Boston come from two longer studies, providing a fuller picture.",
      "In one study, focused on severely ill patients, 78% dropped out, leaving only 35 people for the final analysis. In the other, focused on more stable people, 51% left the study, leaving 283 who took the drug for a year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not any higher or any lower than what we typically see\u201d in schizophrenia studies, said Dr. Greg Mattingly of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Mattingly is a consultant for Bristol Myers Squibb and a researcher on one of the studies.",
      "In the more severely ill group, 69% of people had a meaningful improvement in their symptoms at the end of the year. In the other group, 30% saw a meaningful benefit.",
      "Results of interviews with a sample of study participants conducted by an independent research team and shared by Bristol Myers Squibb showed the likelihood of continuing treatment. After six months, 36 said they would continue taking Cobenfy after the trial if given the option; 10 said they would not. Some participants said the drug reduced the voices while others said it didn't work for them.",
      "The estimated yearly cost for Cobenfy is $22,500 compared to $540 for a generic antipsychotic. Krystal and others worry that insurers will require people to try cheaper drugs first before covering Cobenfy. Most patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs will be much lower, depending on insurance and other factors.",
      "One cheaper generic called clozapine is widely considered one of the best treatments for schizophrenia, Krystal said. It is underused in the U.S. compared to some other countries because of a cumbersome blood testing program.",
      "The FDA started the blood tests to watch for the risk of severe neutropenia, a rare side effect which can be fatal. But doctors and families have told the FDA that patients have relapsed when their clozapine was withheld or delayed because of the testing requirements.",
      "Sally Littlefield, 29, of Alameda, California, said what works for her is a monthly injection of a long-acting antipsychotic medication. Littlefield, who has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, wants to learn more about the experiences of people who've taken Cobenfy and not just from players with a financial stake.",
      "Mindy Greiling of Roseville, Minnesota, wants to see data on how Cobenfy compares to clozapine, which works for her 47-year-old son, Jim. Weight gain was a problem for him, but since taking diabetes medication, he\u2019s back to his normal weight, Greiling said.",
      "Cobenfy \u201cis getting a lot of ballyhoo, as any new drug does,\u201d Greiling said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a nonstarter for me unless it turns out that it\u2019s better than clozapine.\u201d",

      "The British government has apologized for the death of a 9-year-old girl who is believed to be the first person in the U.K. to have air pollution listed on her death certificate, after a decade-long battle that highlighted the risks vehicle emissions p...",
      "LONDON -- The British government has apologized for the death of a 9-year-old girl who is believed to be the first person in the U.K. to have air pollution listed on her death certificate, after a decade-long battle that highlighted the risks vehicle emissions pose to children in low-income communities.",
      "The apology was part of a settlement announced Thursday in a lawsuit filed by the mother of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who developed severe asthma just before her 7th birthday and suffered severe seizures before she died on Feb. 15, 2013. The government also made an undisclosed financial settlement.",
      "\u201cAlthough this isn\u2019t going to bring Ella back, we finally accept this is acknowledgement of what happened to her, and to put the issue of air pollution firmly on the map, that it\u2019s a public health crisis \u2026 and something needs to be done about it,\u2019\u2019 Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, Ella\u2019s mother, said after meeting with government officials. \u201cToday it is finally over, but I am going to continue, and I have been reassured by the government that they\u2019re going to be continuing to work with me to clean up the air.\u201d",
      "Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah fought to reopen the coroner\u2019s inquest into Ella\u2019s death after the so-called Dieselgate scandal revealed how Volkswagen obscured the true level of emissions released by its diesel-powered vehicles. Research by the Royal College of Physicians later showed that about 40,000 deaths can be attributed to outdoor air pollution each year in the U.K., with the burden falling most heavily on low-income communities close to busy roads and other major sources of emissions.",
      "Ella grew up just 25 meters (yards) from the South Circular Road, a major conduit for traffic along the southern edge of central London.",
      "Britain\u2019s High Court in May 2019 set aside the findings of the original inquest, which attributed Ella\u2019s death to asthma.",
      "In December 2020, a second inquest found that air pollution was a contributing factor in Ella\u2019s death, along with acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.",
      "Throughout her illness, Ella was exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter that exceeded World Health Organization guidelines, Deputy Coroner Philip Barlow ruled. There was also a \u201crecognized failure\u201d to bring nitrogen dioxide levels within the limits set by European Union and domestic law.",
      "\u201cElla\u2019s mother was not given information by health professionals about the health risks of air pollution and its potential to exacerbate asthma,\u201d Barlow said. \u201cIf she had been given this information, she would have taken steps which might have prevented Ella\u2019s death.\u201d",
      "The child's estate, which is administered by her mother, sued the Environment Department, the Department for Transport and the Department of Health and Social Care for compensation over Ella\u2019s illness and premature death.",
      "The government on Thursday described Ella\u2019s death as a \u201ctragedy,\u201d and said her mother\u2019s public campaign for better air quality had \u201cmade a considerable impact.\u201d",
      "Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said Environment Minister Emma Hardy reaffirmed her commitment to pass legislation that will bring the U.K. in line with WHO standards, according to a statement released by her law firm, Hodge Jones & Allen.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of the government departments who were party to the claim, we again take this opportunity to say we are truly sorry for your loss and to express our sincerest condolences to you as Ella\u2019s mother, to her siblings, and to everyone who knew her,\u2019\u2019 the government said in the statement. \u201cTo lose a loved one at such a young age is an immeasurable loss.\u201d"

      "A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing COVID-19 vaccines to residents in six counties after a narrow decision by its board",
      "A regional public health department in Idaho is no longer providing COVID-19 vaccines to residents in six counties after a narrow decision by its board.",
      "Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be restricted from giving COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccinations are an essential function of a public health department.",
      "While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright.",
      "\u201cI'm not aware of anything else like this,\u201d said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on \u201ca judgment of the medical product itself.\u201d",
      "The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID vaccines in the health district has declined \u2014 with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10.",
      "On Oct. 22, the health department\u2019s board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban \u2014 despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity.",
      "\u201cOur request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those (vaccines), recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,\u201d Dr. Perry Jansen said at the meeting. \u201cThis is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.\u201d",
      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells \u201ccontagion emergency kits\u201d that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.",
      "Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures.",
      "Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the board's decision.",
      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they\u2019re safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been homeless in my lifetime, so I understand how difficult it can be when you\u2019re ... trying to get by and get ahead,\u201d Aberasturi said. \u201cThis is where we should be stepping in and helping.",

      "Many refugees in Uganda are struggling to get by without the food assistance they once depended on",
      "RWAMWANJA, Uganda -- For months, Agnes Bulaba, a Congolese refugee in Uganda, has had to get by without the food rations she once depended on. Her children scavenge among local communities for whatever they can find to eat.",
      "\u201cAs a woman who\u2019s not married, life is hard,\u201d Bulaba told The Associated Press. Some locals \u201ckeep throwing stones at us, but we just want to feed our kids and buy them some clothes,\u201d said the mother of six, who often works as a prostitute to fend for her family.",
      "Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put much pressure on host communities.",
      "Approximately 10,000 new arrivals enter Uganda each month, according to U.N. figures. Some have recently fled the war in Sudan, but most are from neighboring South Sudan and Congo.",
      "Bulaba is among tens of thousands in Rwamwanja, a refugee settlement in southwestern Uganda. As in other settlements across the east African country, refugees there are given small plots of land to cultivate as they are slowly weaned off total dependence on humanitarian food rations.",
      "Since 2021, as funding consistently declined, the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program has prioritized the most vulnerable groups for food assistance, in food items or cash, which can be as little as $3. After spending three months in Uganda, refugees are eligible to get 60% rations, and the number falls by half after six months. Only new arrivals get 100% food assistance, leaving the vast majority of some 99,000 refugees in Bulaba's settlement vulnerable to hunger and other impoverishment.",
      "In 2017, the Ugandan government and the U.N. held a summit in Kampala, the capital, and appealed for $8 billion to deal with the sharp influx of refugees from South Sudan at the time. Only $350 million was pledged.",
      "Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, visited Uganda last week in a trip partly aimed to underscore the funding shortage.",
      "The international community \u201cshould not take Uganda\u2019s generosity and the global public good it provides for granted,\u201d Grandi said in a statement at the end of his visit. \u201cServices here are overstretched. Natural resources are limited, and financial support is not keeping pace with the needs.\u201d",
      "He also said international support \"is urgently needed to sustain Uganda\u2019s commitment to refugees,\u201d urging donors and humanitarian partners to \u201ccome together with the government to address the needs of refugees and the generous communities hosting them.\u201d",
      "Refugees in Uganda have access to the same hospitals as locals, and their children can attend school. While this helps integrate them into the Ugandan community, sometimes the competition for limited resources sparks tension. However, violence is rarely reported.",
      "Hillary Onek, the Ugandan government minister in charge of refugees, said during Grandi\u2019s visit that local officials need support to help refugees become more self-reliant. Though he said the country was \u201coverloaded\u201d with refugees, he cited several training options to help refugees become self-sufficient, including carpentry, bricklaying and metal welding.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to be innovative,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the fact that funding for refugee programs dwindled over the years, there is not enough money to meet their demands, not even giving them enough food to eat.\u201d",
      "Onek said the alternative is \u201cto survive on your own, using your skills, using whatever capacity you have.\u201d",
      "But Bulaba, the Congolese refugee who has been in Uganda since 2014 after fleeing violence in her home country with her two children, said she can't find a job. She has since had four other children who often go barefoot and without appropriate clothing. She misses the cash-for-food stipend she used to get.",

      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",
      "Georgette Hamuli, an 18-year-old sex worker, hadn\u2019t been aware of mpox until immunization teams arrived last week in the poor neighborhood where she works in Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo.",
      "\u201cThey told us we're highly exposed to the the risk of infection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe insist on condoms with our clients, but some refuse ... if they don\u2019t want to use a condom, they double the amount they pay.\u201d",
      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",
      "Drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, which makes the most widely used mpox vaccine, said it would sell shots destined for Africa at the lowest price possible.",
      "The advocacy group Public Citizen published an analysis showing that UNICEF paid $65 per dose of the Jynneos mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, far higher than nearly all other vaccines used in public health programs.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an infectious diseases expert at South Africa\u2019s University of KwaZulu-Natal, said mpox outbreaks typically peak and disappear quickly because of how the virus spreads. This time, however, he said there are two complicating factors: the virus\u2019 transmission via sex and the continued spillover from infected animals.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory with mpox this time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re never going to solve this until we vaccinate most of our people.\u201d",

      "The Tobacco and Vapes Bill would also bar smoking and vaping in some outdoor spaces such as playgrounds and the entrances to schools and hospitals. But a proposed ban on smoking in pub beer gardens has been dropped after opposition from bar owners.",

      "THULASENDRAPURAM, India -- The temple reverberated with rhythmic Sanskrit and Tamil hymns, as a Hindu priest held a flame before the god. As this tiny South Indian village gathered to pray for Kamala Harris, a gaggle of reporters jostled for space and camera angles.",
      "There's little to distinguish the village of Thulasendrapuram from any other rural community in Tamil Nadu, except its connection to a woman who could become America's first leader with South Asian roots.",
      "As millions of Americans vote, Harris has people rooting for her from thousands of miles away in a village surrounded by rice paddies and coconut trees, where her mother's family has ancestral ties. They talk about her at the local tea shop. Banners and billboards bearing her face are seen throughout the community.",
      "\u201cOur deity is a very powerful God. If we pray well to him, he will make her victorious,\u201d said M. Natarajan, the temple priest that led the prayers in front of the image of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva.",
      "Harris\u2019 maternal grandfather was born in the village, about 350 kilometers (215 miles) from the southern coastal city of Chennai, more than 100 years ago. As an adult, he moved to Chennai, where he worked as a high-ranking government official until his retirement.",
      "Harris has never visited Thulasendrapuram and she has no living relatives in the village, but people here still venerate the family that made it big in the U.S.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported third-quarter profits of $27.5 billion on Tuesday, down about 15% from last year as low oil prices ate into its revenues.",
      "Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $111.1 billion over the quarter, the company said in a filing on Riyadh's Tadawul stock exchange. It had $113 billion in revenues the same quarter last year.",
      "Profits for the third quarter last year were $32.5 billion.",
      "The profit decrease \u201cwas mainly due to the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,\u201d Aramco said.",
      "Profit for the first nine months of 2024 was $83.9 billion, down from $94.5 billion the year before.",
      "Oil prices have been depressed over recent days as tensions in the Middle East appear to have receded slightly and as China's economy has slowed. Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday at around $75 a barrel.",
      "Aramco will pay dividends of $20.28 billion for the third quarter and a performance-linked dividend of $10.77 billion, the company said. It has said it hopes its overall dividend for the year will be over $124 billion.",

      "Stock in Aramco traded around $7.31 a share Tuesday, down from a high this year of over $9. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped.",

      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world\u2019s least expensive places to produce crude. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes to use the oil wealth to pivot the kingdom off oil sales, through projects such as his planned $500 billion futuristic desert city, called Neom. But lower oil prices have Saudi Arabia reportedly looking at curtailing some of those ambitions as the kingdom likely faces looming budget deficits.",
      "Meanwhile, activists criticized the profits amid global concerns about the burning of fossil fuels accelerating climate change."

      "Peel Regional Police said in social media updates that the demonstration in Brampton, Ontario was declared an unlawful assembly shortly before 10 p.m. Monday, after officers saw weapons \u201cwithin the demonstration.\u201d",
      "Pro-Hindu groups who shared details of Monday\u2019s event suggested it came in response to Sikh separatists who protested a visit by Indian consular officials to the temple on Sunday.",
      "Police say the demonstration converged at an intersection outside the Hindu Sabha Mandir temple, shutting down traffic along Gore Road in both directions, before crowds dispersed by 1 a.m.",
      "Three people were arrested and a Peel police officer was suspended after Sunday\u2019s protest. Videos on social media seemed to show fist fights and people striking each other with poles on what appeared to be grounds of the temple.",
      "In response to Monday\u2019s demonstration, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown on Tuesday shared a video of a man he accused of trying to \u201cdirect violence against those of Sikh faith.\u201d",
      "\u201cAgitators trying to incite violence need to be dealt with promptly and swiftly with the full extent of our hate laws,\u201d Brown said in a Tuesday morning post on X.",
      "Before Monday\u2019s demonstration, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had condemned Sunday\u2019s violence as a deliberate attack on a Hindu temple and an attempt to intimidate diplomats.",
      "Canada expelled six Indian diplomats last month for allegations that they used their positions to collect information on Canadians in the Sikh separatist movement, and then passed the details on to criminal gangs who targeted the individuals directly.",
      "India, which has rejected those allegations, has long accused Canada of harboring terrorists involved in a Sikh separatist movement calling for an independent country called Khalistan. Canadian officials have said related extradition requests from India often lack adequate proof.",
      "Relations between the two countries soured after Trudeau said last year there was credible evidence the Indian government had links to the assassination of Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.",
      "Canada is not the only country that has accused Indian officials of plotting an assassination on foreign soil. The United States Justice Department announced criminal charges in mid-October against an Indian government employee in connection with an alleged foiled plot to kill a Sikh separatist leader living in New York City."

ABW believes they are initiated and coordinated by the Russian special services. So far, 20 people have been charged in investigations led by the prosecutor\u2019s office, the ABW and police.",
      "Polish Prosecutor Katarzyna Cal\u00f3w-Jaszewska said the investigation focuses on foreign agents conducting acts of sabotage, including damaging industrial facilities or critical infrastructure such as airports, airplanes and other vehicles, and as well as arson using self-combustible parcels sent to EU countries and the U.K. that would ignite during road or air transport.",
      "She added that the group tested a channel for sending such parcels to the United States and Canada.",

      "Qatar is voting in a snap poll to decide whether to end its limited voting for legislative seats",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Qatar voted in a snap poll Tuesday to decide whether to end its limited voting for legislative seats, a measure likely to pass and end the country's short-lived experiment in electing members of the advisory Shura Council.",
      "Voting took place as the world's attention focused on the U.S. presidential election, with even Qatar\u2019s state-funded satellite news network Al Jazeera offering brief acknowledgments of the vote wedged between coverage of the U.S. election and the Mideast wars. Though Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, announced last month a vote would take place, it was only Sunday that authorities announced the date of the poll.",
      "Voting ran for 12 hours and ended at 7 p.m. local time. Results are expected on Wednesday. All Qatari employees in the country were also granted permission to leave work from 11 a.m. to vote.",
      "Qatar's state news agency described the voting as \u201can enthusiastic atmosphere and a historic moment, clearly confirming everyone\u2019s keenness to make this national celebration a success.\u201d",
      "The vote will \u201cstrengthen the social fabric in the most beautiful image and form, which honestly represents an important stage in the country\u2019s victorious march and its national unity,\u201d the news agency added.",
      "Qatar first introduced plans for legislative elections in its 2003 constitution, but authorities repeatedly postponed implementing the vote. The country finally held elections for two-thirds of the Shura Council, which drafts laws, approves state budgets and advises the ruler, in October 2021.",
      "The elections came after the end of a boycott of Qatar by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that tore the Gulf Arab states apart. It also came about a year ahead of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, an event that drew intense scrutiny from the West of the country's treatment of foreign laborers and its system of governance.",
      "Qatar remains an important nation to the West as it hosted the Taliban and assisted in the chaotic 2021 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan and as a mediator as the Israel-Hamas war rages in the Gaza Strip and has expanded to Lebanon.",
      "But the elections created problems in the energy-rich nation. Electoral law distinguishes between born and naturalized Qatari citizens and bars the latter from electoral participation. Human Rights Watch described the system as \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d excluding thousands of Qataris from running or voting. The disqualifications sparked minor protests that led to several arrests.",
      "In announcing the vote on changing the constitution, Sheikh Tamim said: \u201cThe contest between candidates for membership in the Shura Council took place within families and tribes, and there are different views regarding the repercussions of such competition on our norms, traditions, as well as the conventional social institutions and their cohesion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe contest assumes an identity-based character that we are not equipped to handle, with potential complications over time that we would rather avoid,\" he added.",
      "The vote marks yet another rollback in the hereditarily ruled Gulf Arab states of halting steps to embrace representational rule following efforts by the United States to push harder for democratic reforms in the Middle East after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Hopes for democracy in the region also rose in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring.",
      "In May, the ruler of oil-rich Kuwait dissolved his country\u2019s parliament for as much as four years. While the Kuwaiti parliament had struggled, it represented the Gulf Arab state\u2019s most free-wheeling legislative body and could challenge the country\u2019s rulers."

      "NOVI SAD, Serbia -- Protesters on Tuesday threw flares and red paint on the City Hall building in the Serbian city of Novi Sad in rage over last week's collapse of a concrete canopy at the railway station that killed 14 people. Police responded by firing tear gas canisters.",
      "The protesters surrounded the building in the city center, broke windows and threw stones and other objects despite calls by organizers to remain calm. Special police troops were deployed inside the building.",
      "Serbia\u2019s autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic said police were \u201cshowing restraint,\u201d while warning that \u201chorrific, violent protests are underway.\u201d",

      "Some of the protesters trying to get inside the building wore masks and were believed to be soccer hooligans who are close to the populist government.",
      "Bojan Pajtic, an opposition politician, said he believed violence was being stoked by provocateurs, a tactic used before in Serbia to derail peaceful anti-government protests and paint the opposition protesters as enemies of the nation.",
      "Earlier, thousands of demonstrators had marched through the city streets demanding that top officials step down because of the fatal outer roof collapse last Friday, including President Vucic and Prime Minister Milos Vucevic.",
      "The protesters first gathered outside the railway station where they held a moment of silence for the victims as organizers read their names. The crowd responded by chanting: \u201carrest the gang\u201d and \u201cthieves.\u201d",
      "The protest started peacefully but some demonstrators later hurled plastic bottles and bricks at the headquarters of Vucic\u2019s ruling Serbian Progressive Party and smeared red paint on posters of the Serbian president and the prime minister \u2014 a message that they have blood on their hands.",
      "The protesters removed most of the Serbian national red, blue and white national flags that were apparently hung on the headquarters to prevent it from an attack. That triggered an angry reaction from the president.",
      "\u201cOur Serbian tri-color has been destroyed, hidden and removed by all those who do not love Serbia,\u201d Vucic wrote on X. \u201cTonight, in Novi Sad, this is being done by those who tell us that they love Serbia more than us, the decent citizens of this country.\u201d",
      "As protests wound down later in the evening, Vucic made a surprise trip to Novi Sad and made a brief appearance before his several hundred supporters gathered outside the party headquarters.",
      "Critics of Serbia\u2019s populist government have attributed the disaster to rampant corruption in the Balkan country, a lack of transparency and sloppy work during renovation work on the station building which was part of a wider railway deal with Chinese state companies.",
      "The accident happened without warning. Surveillance camera footage showed the massive canopy on the outer wall of the station building crashing down on the people sitting below on benches or going in and out.",
      "Officials have promised full accountability and, faced with pressure, Serbia\u2019s construction minister submitted his resignation on Tuesday.",
      "Prosecutors have said that more than 40 people already have been questioned as part of a probe into what happened. Many in Serbia, however, doubt that justice will be served with the populists in firm control of the judicial system and the police.",
      "Opposition parties behind Tuesday\u2019s protest said they are also demanding the resignation of Vucevic and that documentation be made public listing all the companies and individuals involved.",
      "The victims included a 6-year-old girl. Those injured in the roof collapse remained in serious condition on Tuesday.",
      "The train station has been renovated twice in recent years. Officials have insisted that the canopy had not been part of the renovation work, suggesting this was the reason why it collapsed but giving no explanation for why it was not included.",
      "The Novi Sad railway station was originally built in 1964, while the renovated station was inaugurated by Vucic and his populist ally, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, over two years ago as a major stopover for a planned fast train line between Belgrade and Budapest."

      "The Danish-Swedish 42-year-old man, who was not named but has been identified by Swedish media as Rasmus Paludan, founder and head of the Danish nationalist anti-immigration party Stram Kurs, had been previously convicted and sentenced by a Danish court on a similar charge, the Malmo District Court said.",
      "In 2022, Paludan made his offensive remarks directed at Muslims, Arabs and Africans during protests that he led in the southern city of Malmo in 2022, the court said. He also burned a copy of the Quran, Islam's holy book, on at least one occasion. In response, a violent wave of riots swept the country.",

      "Chief Councilor Nicklas S\u00f6derberg, the court\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cIt is permitted to publicly make critical statements about, for example, Islam and also Muslims, but the disrespect of a group of people must not clearly cross the line for a factual and valid discussion.\"",
      "He added that during the Malmo rallies in April and September 2022 \u201cthere was no question of any such discussion,\u201d and that Paludan\u2019s public statements \u201conly amounted to insulting Muslims.\"",
      "The court took particular interest in whether the politician knew the protests were filmed and published on Facebook. Paludan had said that he wasn't aware of it but the district court disagreed and said his \u201cactions at the gatherings would be downright illogical if he didn\u2019t know about the publication on Facebook.\u201d",
      "Paludan, a lawyer by profession, told Swedish media outlets that he wasn\u2019t surprised by the verdict.",
      "\u201cIt was expected. We will appeal,\u201d the Swedish newspaper Expressen cited him as saying."

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- It\u2019s tough being a reporter in Cambodia, whose government frowns on independent journalism that questions authority.",
      "Veteran investigative reporter Mech Dara learned the hard way, when he was recently jailed on a felony charge for some items he had posted on Facebook.",
      "Now he plans to be a farmer, he said Tuesday.",
      "In a statement of support last month from Cambodian media organizations and civil society groups, Mech Dara was praised as \u201ca front-line investigative journalist whose stories over the last decade have uncovered corruption, environmental destruction, and human trafficking at scam compounds across the country, and has consistently pushed for accountability and justice.\u201d",
      "But now out on bail, Mech Dara told The Associated Press he plans to leave the profession and grow vegetables in his hometown in Kandal province, just south of the capital Phnom Penh.",
      "When not tending his crop, he might also sell coconuts or other items, he said.",
      "Mech Dara recalled he spent 12 years working as journalist, for the Cambodia Daily and the Phnom Penh Post, two once-vibrant English-language newspapers forced to shut down under government pressure, and the Voice of Democracy radio and website, which was closed by the government last year. Now 36 years old, he had since then been working as a freelancer.",
      "\u201cIn fact, I had been determined to keep working as a journalist for many years to come,\u201d he said, \u201cand to overcome all the obstacles I would meet.\"",
      "But a few weeks spent in jail, with poor prospects of prevailing in court, changed his mind. Cambodia\u2019s government has long been accused of using the judicial system to persecute critics and political opponents.",
      "Mech Dara was arrested on Sept. 30 by a posse of military police at a toll booth as he was returning with his family to the capital Phnom Penh from a seaside holiday. The next day, he was formally charged with incitement to commit a felony or cause social disorder for items he posted online in late September. The offense carried a penalty of imprisonment for six months to two years, along with a fine.",
      "Mech Dara said his initial, all-night interrogation was rough. He was in handcuffs and flanked by two policemen armed with AK-47 assault rifles as he was questioned. And they walked him up and down from the ground floor to the second floor, again and again, threatening him repeatedly.",
      "Matters didn\u2019t improve when he was sent to pre-trial detention at the Kandal provincial prison.",
      "He neither slept nor ate well in the narrow, overcrowded cell where he was kept for more than three weeks. He said he saw prisoners slapping and punching each other and fainting, and heard of others dying. It made him wonder \u201cwhether or not I could see tomorrow and if the next day it could be me.\"",
      "Adding to his concerns were his existing health problems, including Hepatitis B.",
      "At the same time, he realized that the prospects of earning a living as a reporter were shrinking, especially because as a freelance journalist it was difficult to get licensed by the Information Ministry,.",
      "His situation took a new turn on Oct. 23, when Fresh News, a pro-government media outlet, published a video of him in an orange prison uniform, apologizing to Prime Minister Hun Manet and former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is now president of the Senate. Hun Manet succeeded his long-serving father as prime minister last year but so far has shown little more tolerance for criticism.",
      "In a minute-long clip, Mech Dara stated he had posted five instances of false information in the past that were harmful to Cambodia and its leaders, and he promised not to post false information in the future.",
      "The next day he was released on bail.",
      "The most recent adjustment to his situation came on Monday, when Hun Manet on his Facebook page shared two photographs of him and Mech Dara, one in which they hugged each other, and another of them sitting face to face,.",
      "Hun Manet said he had met Mech Dara and they talked about several topics, such as freedom of expression and the responsibility of journalists to publish true information, and to adhere to their professional code of ethics.",
      "Mech Dara hasn\u2019t posted anything on his Facebook page since his release.",

The costume really impacts how you carry your body, and that posture influences your mind, giving character to this woman of state.\u201d",
      "The production underscored a growing trend in Paris of using light technology to show off the city's storied church interiors. A similar illuminations display took place at Saint-Eustache church until September, featuring video projections, lighting effects and spatialized electronic soundtrack.",

      "A French court has found 18 defendants guilty in a migrant-smuggling trial linked to the perilous English Channel route from France to the U.K. One of the ringleaders, from Iraq, was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison and fined $218,000",
      "LILLE, France -- A French court found 18 people guilty Tuesday in a major migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people on flimsy boats across the perilous sea from France to the U.K.",
      "The defendants were swept up in a pan-European police operation in 2022 that led to dozens of arrests and the seizure of boats, life jackets, outboard engines, paddles, and cash.",
      "The court in Lille, northern France, sentenced one of the ringleaders, Mirkhan Rasoul, a 26-year-old from Iraq, to 15 years in prison and a fine of 200,000 euros ($218,000). Rasoul attended the trial in a secured plexiglass box and under the surveillance of armed police.",
      "Other sentences ranged from two years to 10 years in prison.",
      "\u201cThese sentences are obviously very severe,\u201d said Kamel Abbas, a lawyer who represented one of the defendants already imprisoned in France. \u201cThat\u2019s a testimony of the scale of the case, and of the intention to severely punish the smugglers.\u201d",
      "Most of the defendants were not in court for the verdicts and sentencing. Some attended the trial remotely from various prisons in northern France, while others are not in custody. Fourteen of the 18 defendants were from Iraq, with the others from Iran, Poland, France and the Netherlands.",
      "Each of the defendants, except for the one from France, was given a ban on remaining on French territory after serving their sentence.",
      "Craig Turner, deputy director of the British National Crime Agency (NCA), involved in the arrest of one of the defendants, said the network was one of the most prolific organizers of crossings.",
      "\u201cTheir sole motive was profit, and they didn\u2019t care about the fate of migrants they were putting to sea in wholly inappropriate and dangerous boats,\" Turner said.",
      "\u201cWe are putting more resource into disrupting and dismantling the criminal gangs behind it than ever before,\u201d Turner said.",
      "The criminal network was making approximately \u20ac100,000 ($109,035) from each crossing according to a statement from the NCA published on Tuesday.",
      "The trial comes in what has been a particularly deadly year for attempted crossings of the English Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.",
      "More than 31,000 migrants have made the perilous Channel crossing so far this year, more than in all of 2023, though fewer than in 2022. At least 56 people have perished in the attempts this year, according to French officials, making 2024 the deadliest since the crossings began surging in 2018.",
      "The route, despite French and British efforts to stop it, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties, or perceived easier access to asylum and work.",
      "Europe\u2019s increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants are also pushing many migrants north.",
      "On Monday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for international cooperation against smuggling gangs, likening the issue to a global security threat on par with terrorism.",
      "Starmer told a conference of international police organization Interpol that \u201cpeople-smuggling should be viewed as a global security threat similar to terrorism.\u201d He said intelligence and law-enforcement agencies should try to \u201cstop smuggling gangs before they act\u201d in the same way they do in counterterrorism operations.",

      "WICHITA, KANSAS -- Sobs of relief broke out in a federal courtroom in Kansas on Monday as dozens of people whose life savings had been embezzled by a bank CEO learned that federal law enforcement had recovered their money.",
      "\"I just can\u2019t describe the weight lifted off of us,\u201d said Bart Camilli, 70, who with his wife Cleo had just learned they\u2019d recover close to $450,000 \u2014 money Bart began saving at 18 when he bought his first individual retirement account. \u201cIt\u2019s life-changing.\u201d",
      "In August, former Kansas bank CEO Shan Hanes was sentenced to 24 years after stealing $47 million from customer accounts and wiring the money to cryptocurrency accounts run by scammers. Prosecutors said Hanes also stole $40,000 from his church, $10,000 from an investment club and $60,000 from his daughter\u2019s college fund and lost $1.1 million of his own in the scheme. Deposits were \u201cjettisoned into the ether,\u201d said prosecutor Aaron Smith.",
      "Hanes' Heartland Tri-State Bank, drained of cash, was shut down by federal regulators and sold to another financial institution. Customers\u2019 savings and checking accounts amounting to $47.1 million were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which paid off their losses.",
      "But there were still 30 shareholders of the community-owned rural bank Hanes helped found \u2014 including his close family friends and neighbors \u2014 who thought they lost $8.3 million in investments: well-planned retirements were upended, funds for long-term eldercare gone, education funds and bequests for children and grandchildren zeroed out.",
      "On Monday the shareholders stood to cheer federal Judge John W. Broomes in Wichita after he told them, one at a time, that they\u2019d be paid back in full. The FBI recovered the funds from a cryptocurrency account held by Tether Ltd. in the Cayman Islands.",
      "During an earlier sentencing hearing, these victims had called Hanes a \u201cdeceitful cheat and a liar,\u201d and \u201cpure evil.\u201d",
      "Margaret Grice came to court Monday figuring she\u2019d get $1,000 back. Instead, she learned she\u2019d be recovering almost $250,000, her entire 401(k).",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just really thrilled,\u201d she said. \u201cI can breathe.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes, who was the CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank in Elkhart, Kansas, lost the money in a scam referred to as \u201cpig butchering,\u201d or the way pigs are fattened before slaughter. In the scam, a third party gains a victims' trust and, over time, convinces them to invest all of their money into cryptocurrency, which immediately disappears. U.S. and U.N. officials say these schemes are proliferating, with scammers largely in Southeast Asia increasingly taking advantage of Americans.",
      "Hanes started buying what he thought was $5,000 in cryptocurrency in late 2022, communicating with someone who had reached out on WhatsApp, according to court records. A few months later he transferred over his church and investment club funds. Records show the scam accelerated in the summer of 2023, when Hanes wired $47.1 million out of customer accounts in 11 wire transfers over just eight weeks. Each transfer, he thought, was necessary to end the investment and cash out, court records said. He watched, on a fake website, as the money appeared to grow to more than $200 million.",
      "\u201cHe was to take some of the money, and the rest of the money was supposed to go back to the bank,\u201d his attorney John Stang explained. \u201cNow it's fiction, it didn't exist. We all know that now ... It failed big time.\u201d",
      "Hanes, who was not in court Monday, apologized at an earlier sentencing hearing.",
      "\u201cFrom the deepest depth of my soul, I had no intention of ever causing the harm that I did,\" he said. \u201dI\u2019ll forever struggle to understand how I was duped and how what I thought was just getting the money back was making it worse.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Hanes wasn\u2019t just the victim of a scam, he crossed a line when he began taking customers' money and violating banking regulations. He pleaded guilty to embezzlement by a bank officer in May.",
      "His prominent standing in his hometown of 2,000 made it easier for him to get away with it, a Federal Reserve System investigation found; he had been on the school board, volunteered as a swim meet official, and served on the Kansas Bankers Association.",
      "He also was a banking leader beyond his rural community. In recent years, he testified to Congressional committees about the importance of local banks in farming communities, and he served as a director for the American Bankers Association, which represents almost all banking assets in the U.S.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors said the FDIC wanted to be paid back for the insurance claims it reimbursed to bank customers. But Judge Broomes said the economic circumstances of shareholders \u201cwho became insolvent because of a fraud scheme\u201d justified paying them back first, before the FDIC recovers anything.",
      "Hanes, 53, may be in his late 70s when he is released and is unlikely to be able to pay the FDIC the $47.1 million still owed.",
      "In a court filing, Hanes and his attorney tried to explain what had happened.",
      "\u201cMr. Hanes made some very bad choices after being caught up in an extremely well-run cryptocurrency scam,\u201d they said. \u201cHe was the pig that was butchered.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 05 Nov 2024 16:42:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Factory workers at Boeing have voted to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks",
    "story": [
      "Factory workers at Boeing have voted to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks",
      "SEATTLE -- Factory workers at Boeing have voted to accept a contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks, clearing the way for the company to restart idled Pacific Northwest assembly lines.",
      "But the strike was just one of many challenges the troubled U.S. aerospace giant faces as it works to return to profitability and regain public confidence.",
      "Boeing\u2019s 33,000 striking machinists disbanded their picket lines late Monday after leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers district in Seattle said 59% of union members who cast ballots agreed to approve the company\u2019s fourth formal offer, which included a 38% wage increase over four years.",
      "Union machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing\u2019s bestselling airliner, along with the 777 or \u201ctriple-seven\u201d jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. Resuming production will allow Boeing to generate much-needed cash, which it has been bleeding.",
      "\u201cEven for a company the size of Boeing, it is a life-threatening problem,\u201d said Gautam Mukunda, lecturer at the Yale School of Management.",
      "The union said its workers can return to work as soon as Wednesday or as late as Nov. 12. Boeing CEO Kelly  Ortberg has said it might take \u201ca couple of weeks\u201d to resume production in part because some workers might need retraining.",
      "As the machinists get back to work, management will have to address a host of other problems. The company needs to get on better financial footing. But while doing so, it also needs to prioritize the quality of its workmanship and its relationships with employees and suppliers, analysts said.",
      "Boeing has been managing itself to meet short-term profit goals and \u201csqueezing every stakeholder, squeezing every employee, every supplier to the point of failure in order in order to maximize their short-term financial performance,\u201d Mukunda said. \u201cThat is bad enough if you run a clothing company. It is unacceptable when you are building the most complex mass-produced machines human beings have ever built.\u201d",
      "Above all, Boeing needs to produce more planes. When workers are back and production resumes, the company will be producing about 30 737s a month, and \u201cthey must get that number over 50. They have to do it. And the people who are going to do that are the workers on the factory floor,\u201d Mukunda said.",
      "Another challenge will be getting the company's fragile supply chain running again, said Cai von Rumohr, an aviation analyst at financial services firm TD Cowen. Suppliers that were working ahead of Boeing\u2019s schedule when the strike began may have had to lay workers off or finance operations on their own.",
      "\"There are lots of nasty questions in terms of complexities that go into revamping the supply chain,\u201d he said.",
      "One way Boeing could generate cash would be to sell companies that don\u2019t fit directly in the business, such as flight information provider Jeppesen Sanderson, which it bought in 2000 for $1.5 billion, von Rumohr said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019d lose some earnings but they\u2019d get a lot of cash to reduce their debt,\u201d he added. \u201cThey really need to get to a more stable position where they have a solid credit rating.\u201d",
      "Ortberg acknowledged the challenges ahead in a message to employees after they voted to end the walkout.",
      "\u201cThere is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company,\" he said.",
      "The average annual pay of Boeing machinists is currently $75,608 and eventually will rise to $119,309 under the new contract, according to the company. The union said the compounded value of the promised pay raise would amount to an increase of more than 43% over the life of the agreement.",
      "Reactions were mixed even among union members who voted to accept the contract.",
      "Although she voted \u201cyes,\u201d Seattle-based calibration specialist Eep Bola\u00f1o said the outcome was \u201cmost certainly not a victory.\u201d Bola\u00f1o said she and her fellow workers made a wise but infuriating choice to accept the offer.",
      "\u201cWe were threatened by a company that was crippled, dying, bleeding on the ground, and us as one of the biggest unions in the country couldn't even extract two-thirds of our demands from them. This is humiliating,\" she said.",
      "For other workers like William Gardiner, a lab lead in calibration services, the revised offer was a cause for celebration.",
      "\u201cI'm extremely pumped over this vote,\u201d said Gardiner, who has worked for Boeing for 13 years. \u201cWe didn't fix everything \u2014 that's OK. Overall, it's a very positive contract.\u201d",
      "Along with the wage increase, the new contract gives each worker a $12,000 ratification bonus and retains a performance bonus the company wanted to eliminate.",
      "President Joe Biden congratulated the machinists and Boeing for coming to an agreement that he said supports fairness in the workplace and improves workers\u2019 ability to retire with dignity. The contract, he said, is important for Boeing\u2019s future as \u201ca critical part of America\u2019s aerospace sector.\u201d",
      "A continuing strike would have plunged Boeing into further financial peril and uncertainty. Last month, Ortberg announced plans to lay off about 17,000 people and a stock sale to prevent the company\u2019s credit rating from being cut to junk status.",
      "The labor standoff \u2014 the first strike by Boeing machinists since an eight-week walkout in 2008 \u2014 was the latest setback in a volatile year for the aerospace giant.",
      "Boeing came under several federal investigations this year after a door plug blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.",
      "The door-plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737 Max. Two of the planes had crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. The CEO at the time, whose efforts to fix the company failed, announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who approved the 737 Max.",

      "State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- State police have destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of marijuana plants at greenhouses in northwestern New Mexico, marking what regulators say is the largest seizure and destruction of cannabis in New Mexico since new possession and cultivation laws took effect in 2021.",
      "Authorities announced the operation Monday, saying dozens of agents were assigned to eradicate the plants in October. The state Cannabis Control Division had started the process of revoking the license of NNK Equity LLC, having filed a noncompliance order and a default order earlier this year.",
      "The company was accused of not posting its licenses on site, failing to obtain water rights for cultivation, not having cameras that could monitor certain areas of its operation and violating sanitation and health requirements.",
      "\u201cThe organization involved showed a blatant disregard for the laws of this state and we will prove that once this investigation is over,\u201d New Mexico State Police Chief Troy Weisler said in a statement.",
      "Jacob Candelaria, an Albuquerque attorney who represents NNK Equity, disputed the state's claims and accused regulators and state police of violating his client's civil rights. He said the state failed to properly serve notice of its intent to revoke the company's license and subsequently denied a request for a hearing on the merits of the case.",
      "He said clients Irving Lin and Bao Xue speak Mandarin Chinese and have limited ability to understand the written English language. Lin asked for a Chinese translation, but the attorney said regulators did not respond to his request.",
      "The Cannabis Control Division stated in filings related to the case that it complied with notice and hearing requirements and had afforded the company its due process rights.",
      "The company plans to ask a state district judge to set aside the order revoking the license and to order state regulators to hold a hearing, Candelaria said. He added that NNK Equity also plans to sue the state for destroying what he said amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars of private property.",
      "\u201cThe idea that law enforcement officers can destroy public property based upon a temporary restraining order \u2014 which can be entered without notice to all parties and before a hearing on the evidence \u2014 which was the case here, should concern all of us who believe in the Constitution.\u201d",
      "According to state regulators, NNK Equity was issued a license in December 2023 for a marijuana growing operation at a property in Waterflow, a rural area on the edge of the Navajo Nation and just south of the Colorado border. The region also made headlines earlier this year when state regulators cracked down on two other operations and Navajo Nation authorities ended up filing their own charges against two tribal members.",
      "In the latest case, the Cannabis Control Division conducted a compliance check in June and determined that NNK Equity had exceeded its allotted plant count. The New Mexico State Police Special Investigations Unit was brought in and later found plants at a second location that was not licensed.",
      "The violations outlined by state regulators also involve transportation and tracking requirements, which include assigning identifying numbers to each plant."

      "Bernard \u201cBernie\u201d Marcus, the co-founder of The Home Depot, a billionaire philanthropist, and a big Republican donor, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Bernard \u201cBernie\u201d Marcus, the co-founder of The Home Depot, a billionaire philanthropist, and a big Republican donor, has died. He was 95.",
      "Marcus died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by family, according to a Home Depot spokesperson.",
      "Marcus was Home Depot's CEO as it grew rapidly during its first two decades, and was chairman of the board until his retirement in 2002. Home Depot is now the world\u2019s largest home improvement chain. In recent years, he became an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWe owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHe was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He\u2019s left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture. \u201d",
      "The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Marcus was born in 1929 and grew up in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey, according to a biography on the company's website. Marcus had aspirations of becoming a doctor, but his family couldn't afford medical school and he endeavored to become a pharmacist, receiving a degree from Rutgers University. Marcus used to say he'd skip classes to sell Amana freezers door-to-door, according to Home Depot.",
      "After college, Marcus worked at the manufacturing conglomerate O\u2019Dell\u2019s and the retail chain Vornado, quickly ascending the corporate ladder. By 1972, Marcus was chairman and president of Handy Dan Improvement Centers, part of the Daylin conglomerate. It was there that Marcus formed a lifelong friendship with Arthur Blank.",
      "The big moment in his career arrived after he was fired by Handy Dan in 1978, along with Blank. Marcus had dreamt of a one-stop shop for do-it-yourselfers. At age 49, Marcus, along with Blank, founded Home Depot. Investment banker Ken Langone helped to secure financing to get The Home Depot started, according to the company.",
      "The first Home Depot opened in Atlanta the following year and by 1981, the company went public and began selling stock. There are now more than 2,000 Home Depot stores and the company employs more than 500,000 people. In the past decade annual sales at Home Depot have doubled, reaching nearly $153 billion in 2023",
      "Marcus has financially supported various charities as well as Jewish and medical organizations through donations. He also built the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, one of the largest in the world. The company said that his philanthropic work will continue through The Marcus Foundation, with a focus on Jewish causes, children, medical research, free enterprise and the community.",
      "Marcus was a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, donating nearly $5 million to the Republican Party between 2016 and 2020, according to OpenSecrets, an organization that tracks political spending. Last year, Marcus penned an op-ed for Real Clear Politics, a clearinghouse of elections data and analysis, that spelled out the reasons he was endorsing Trump for a second term.",

      "The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to pull closer to its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 427 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.4%.",
      "The market got a lift from a report showing growth accelerated last month for retailers, transportation companies and other businesses in the U.S. services industries. That was despite economists\u2019 expectations for a slowdown, and the Institute for Supply Management  said it was the strongest growth in more than two years.",
      "The report offered more hope that the U.S. economy will remain solid  and avoid a long-feared recession  following the worst inflation in generations.",
      "Excitement about the artificial-intelligence boom also helped lift the stock market, as it has for much of the last year. Software company Palantir Technologies jumped 23.5% after delivering bigger profit and revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter. It\u2019s an industry known for thinking and talking big, and CEO Alexander Karp said, \u201cWe absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won\u2019t slow down.\u201d",
      "It helped offset a 5.2% drop for NXP Semiconductors. The Dutch company fell to one of the largest losses in the S&P 500 after warning that weakness it saw in the industrial and other markets during the latest quarter is spreading to Europe and the Americas.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 70.07 points to 5,782.76. The Dow gained 427.28 to 42,221.88, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 259.19 to 18,439.17.",
      "The market\u2019s main event Tuesday was the election, even if the result may not be known for days or weeks as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.",
      "Despite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, even if each party\u2019s policies can help and hurt different industries\u2019 profits.",
      "Since 1945, the S&P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation\u2019s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.",
      "The U.S. stock market has risen more in magnitude when Democrats have been president, in part because a loss under George W. Bush\u2019s term hurt the Republicans\u2019 average. Bush took over as the dot-com bubble was deflating and exited office when the 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession were devastating markets.",
      "Besides who will be president, other questions hanging over the market include whether the White House will be working with a unified Congress or one split by political parties, as well as whether the results will be contested.",
      "The general hope among investors is often for split control of the U.S. government because that\u2019s more likely to keep the status quo and avoid big changes that could drive the nation\u2019s debt much, much higher.",
      "As for a contested election, Wall Street has some precedent to look back to. In 2000, the S&P 500 dropped 5% in about five weeks after Election Day before Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush. That, though, also happened during the near-halving of the S&P 500 from March 2000 to October 2002 as the dot-com bubble deflated.",
      "Four years ago, the S&P 500 rose the day after polls closed, even though a winner wasn\u2019t yet clear. And it kept going higher after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, which created plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "The S&P 500 ended up rising 69.6% from Election Day 2020 through Monday, following President Joe Biden\u2019s win. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation.",
      "In the four years before that, the S&P 500 rose 57.5% from Election Day 2016 through Election Day 2020, in part because of cuts to tax rates signed by Trump.",
      "Investors have already made moves in anticipation of a win by either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. But Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, suggests not getting caught up in such pre-election moves, or even those immediately after the polls close, \u201cwhich we believe will face inevitable tempering, if not outright reversals, either before or after Inauguration Day.\u201d",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury initially rallied following Tuesday morning\u2019s strong report on U.S services businesses but pared the gain later in the day. It slipped to 4.28% from 4.29% late Monday.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe and Asia. The moves were mostly modest outside of jumps of 2.3% in Shanghai and 2.1% in Hong Kong.",

      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture says that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \u201cprocessing fees\u201d for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can\u2019t afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department\u2019s policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\u201cUSDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\u201d said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \u201cWhile today\u2019s action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\u201d",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just massively inconvenient,\u201d said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\u201cA dollar here and there, I expected,\u201d she said. \u201cBut $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\u201d",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child\u2019s account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \u201cmay insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\u201d Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \u201cfamilies have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\u201d the agency said, \u201cincluding those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\u201d",

There were 470 work stoppages (466 strikes and four lockouts) involving approximately 539,000 workers last year, according to Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. The nearly 500 work stoppages resulted in approximately 24,874,522 strike days.",
      "While the number of work stoppages increased by only 9% between 2022 and 2023, the number of workers involved in those work stoppages skyrocketed 141% to well over a half million workers, according to Cornell.",
      "Unions including the UAW, the Teamsters and, most recently, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, say they made the sacrifices asked of them by their companies during the pandemic and previous periods of distress for different economic sectors. Workers have stood firm on demands of late, however, saying that now is the time for companies, which have been consistently posting billions of dollars in profits every year, to catch up and pay workers what they are owed.",
      "Here's a look at some recent standoffs between corporate America and workers.",
      "Late last year the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly ratified new contracts with Ford and Stellantis, along with a similar deal with General Motors, that would raise pay across the industry and force automakers to absorb higher costs.",
      "The agreements, which run through April 2028, ended contentious talks that began in the summer of 2022 and led to six-week-long strikes at all three automakers.",
      "The new contract agreements were widely seen as a victory for the UAW. The companies agreed to dramatically raise pay for top-scale assembly plant workers, with increases and cost-of-living adjustments that would translate into 33% wage gains.",
      "Top assembly plant workers were to receive immediate 11% raises and would earn roughly $42 an hour when the contracts expire in April of 2028.",
      "Under the agreements, the automakers also ended many of the multiple tiers of wages they had used to pay different workers. They also agreed in principle to bring new electric-vehicle battery plants into the national union contract.",
      "UPS workers that are members of the Teamsters union approved a tentative contract with the package delivery company last year. The run-up to the approval was acrimonious, with labor negotiations that threatened to disrupt package deliveries for millions of businesses and households nationwide.",
      "After negotiations broke down in early July 2023, Atlanta-based UPS reached a contract agreement with the Teamsters just days before an Aug. 1 deadline.",
      "At the time the agreement was struck, full- and part-time union workers were set to get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more in total by the end of the five-year contract. Starting hourly pay for part-time employees also got bumped up to $21, but some workers said that fell short of their expectations.",
      "UPS said at the time that by the end of the new contract, the average UPS full-time driver would make about $170,000 annually in pay and benefits. It was not clear how much of that figure benefits accounted for.",
      "As part of the deal, the delivery company also agreed to make Martin Luther King Jr. Day a full holiday, end forced overtime on drivers\u2019 days off and stop using driver-facing cameras in cabs, among a host of other issues. It eliminated a two-tier wage system for drivers and agreements on safety issues were also reached, including equipping more trucks with air conditioning.",
      "In September video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers\u2019 union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.",

      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.",
      "The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around \u201cexploitative uses\u201d of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.",
      "Thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts in August, a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.",

      "The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.",
      "Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.",
      "The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser\u2019s facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.",
      "The lead up to the tentative agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.",
      "The tentative agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.",
      "Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.",

      "Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports returned to work in October after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have eventually caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.",
      "A walkout would have shut down as many as 36 ports that handle almost half of the nation\u2019s cargo from ships entering and exiting the nation. Any such strike would eventually have led to shortages that would have hurt the U.S. economy if the walkout by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on for more than a month.",
      "The dispute is not over, however. Longshoremen suspended its strike after three days, but that lasts only until Jan. 15, providing more time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.",
      "Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points."

    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",

      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 3, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 5, 2024 to correct that TV sizes are measured on the diagonal, not by width."

      "Private companies that provide both water and sewage have failed to update their often-Victorian infrastructure as populations have grown and demand swelled.

The number of discharges increased by more than 50% last year to a record 464,000 spills, according to the Environment Agency.",

      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Monday on its website that its analysis traced the problem to intake valves that can fracture inside some 2.7-liter and 3-liter turbocharged engines.",

      "The agency was looking into catastrophic engine failures caused by intake valves fracturing, dropping into the cylinder and hitting the piston.",
      "The documents say a forensic analysis of fractured valves found that when the they were made by a parts supplier, the temperature got too high, making them brittle and likely to fracture during normal engine use.",
      "An analysis of failure report data found that the faulty valves were made from May through October of 2021, the agency said. Ford contended that not all valves produced during this period were faulty and that a vast majority of the failures happened before the vehicles were driven 20,000 miles.",
      "An agency statistical analysis to predict the number of failures, and an analysis of failure reports \u201care generally consistent\u201d with Ford's determination that the valves would fail at low mileage, and the majority of vehicles with the faulty valves \u201chave already experienced a failure,\u201d the agency said.",
      "Earlier this year Ford recalled about 91,000 vehicles with valves made during the suspect period. They'll be tested and get a new engine if necessary. The company also extended the warranty on vehicles with valves made during the period to 10 years or 150,000 miles, the documents said.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Max Verstappen's come-from-behind win in the pouring rain at the Brazilian Grand Prix on Sunday didn't just put him a lot closer to a fourth straight Formula One title.",
      "After 10 races without a win, it also reminded everyone of why the Dutch driver is a three-time champion in the first place.",
      "Verstappen delivered one of the best performance of his career to move up from 17th at the start and clinch a victory that increased his lead over McLaren's Lando Norris from 44 to 62 points with just three grand prix races and a sprint race remaining.",
      "\u201cSimply lovely,\u201d Verstappen summed it up on the team radio.",
      "His fellow drivers were more effusive.",
      "\u201cAmazing,\u201d said seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes.",
      "\u201cIncredible,\u201d gushed Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.",
      "\u201cFantastic,\u201d added Aston Martin\u2019s Fernando Alonso, a two-time F1 champion.",
      "The only dissenting voice was Norris, who started on pole but finished sixth and later argued that the race was decided by luck as his team made a pit stop just before a red flag came out.",
      "\u201cHe drove well, he got a bit lucky,\u201d Norris said. \u201cYou take a gamble, and it has paid off for them. It is not talent; it is just luck.\u201d",
      "With only 86 points up for grabs until the end of the season, Verstappen only needs to finish ahead of Norris in Las Vegas to secure the title in two weeks.",
      "The Red Bull driver had expected a tough weekend at Interlagos. He received a five-place grid penalty after changing his engine for the sixth time in the season; lost one point in Saturday\u2019s sprint race because of another penalty; and got unlucky during qualifying when the session was interrupted just as he was attempting to clock a fast lap, leaving him in 12th place.",
      "But then everything went right for him in the race.",
      "He surged past rivals at the start and had passed a handful of cars before the first lap was over. In a crash-ridden race where visibility was hindered by the constant spray of water from the cars in front, Verstappen kept overtaking car after car and ended up finishing almost 20 seconds ahead of second-placed Esteban Ocon of Alpine.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely an emotional win,\u201d Verstappen said. \u201cI was really motivated and put everything into this race and I surprised myself today as I wasn\u2019t expecting to finish in P1.\u201d",
      "The manner of the victory also sent a message to some of Verstappen's critics, who had described his driving style as being too aggressive.",
      "\u201c(Verstappen) silenced a few critics today,\u201d said former F1 champion Damon Hill, who himself was one of those critics.",
      "In his post-race press conference, the Red Bull driver also took a shot at some of the British journalists who have questioned his abilities in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI have a quick question here. I appreciate all of you being here, but I don\u2019t see any British press,\u201d Verstappen said, drawing laughter. \u201cDo they have to run to the airport, or they don\u2019t know where the press conference is?\u201d",
      "Fans at Interlagos were also impressed by the Dutch driver's performance.",
      "Many of them, like Carlos Santos de Ara\u00fajo, 65, were hesitant to support Verstappen because of his ties to Nelson Piquet, the father of his girlfriend Kelly and the main rival of another Brazilian three-time F1 champion, the late local hero Ayrton Senna.",
      "Sunday'a race put Verstappen under a different light, de Ara\u00fajo said.",
      "\u201cNo one can be indifferent to what Max did today. I am sure he will think this the best race of his life, one of the best here at Interlagos,\u201d he said, wearing a Senna shirt and a Mercedes cap. \u201cHardcore F1 fans like me do like him as a driver, but today probably changed his status for us all. Anyone who thought he was just cold and sometimes arrogant will see the fighter that he was to win this. That adds to him being a champion.\u201d",

      "With their season in shambles, the Browns agreed to trade the experienced edge rusher on Tuesday to the NFC North-leading Lions, who needed to bolster their pass rush following star Aidan Hutchinson's leg injury.",
      "Cleveland sent Smith and a seventh-round pick in 2026 to the Lions in exchange for a fifth-round pick in 2025 and a sixth-round pick in 2026.",

      "\u201cI think even for me, it was a little more emotional walking out seeing the Maine across their chest,\u201d Cooper Flagg said. \u201cObviously, that\u2019s a team that I grew up watching when I was young. Seeing them gave me a lot more emotions and knowing it was the first real game. It was definitely a high-emotion game for me, but I was able to just take it in stride and handle business.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-9 forward didn\u2019t have a hot-shooting start to a career that is all but certain to be a single-year stopover on the way to the NBA as a possible No. 1 overall pick. But he turned in an all-around floor game that had him making plays on the glass, as a facilitator and bringing the ball up in transition all the same.",
      "He made 6 of 15 shots in his roughly 30 minutes of work, making all six of his free throws but missing all four of his 3-point shots \u2014 including a couple in the first half that either rolled or rattled out. But he also glided across the court to make his presence felt within the flow of the game, including a pair of waved-off finishes after the whistle that would have counted as and-1s with continuation rules at the next level.",
      "\u201cI thought he was close to having 25 tonight honestly, with some of those finishes, a couple of open shots,\" said Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who outdueled two-time reigning national champion UConn to land Flagg. \"That\u2019s going to fall. I think the thing that\u2019s exiting for me watching him is just how he makes everybody better and how he plays every possession.\u201d",
      "Indeed, beyond the assists that came either with high-low entries to 7-foot-2 freshman Khaman Maluach or by skipping the ball across the defense, Flagg also drew eight of Maine's 19 team fouls on the night as a matchup problem for the America East program. He also showed plenty of zip, at one point diving on the floor for a steal after knocking the ball loose near halfcourt \u2014 with Duke up 29 points with about four minutes left.",
      "\u201cHe just goes out and has fun and plays basketball,\u201d junior point guard Tyrese Proctor said. \u201cHe doesn't overcomplicate his game. He just makes the right play and it's really fun to play with.\u201d",
      "Flagg's first college points came on free throws, his first field goal on a stickback with 6:25 before halftime. And yes, there was an impressive move that the \u201cCameron Crazies\u201d \u2014 and anyone else ready to dissect Flagg's every move \u2014 were ready to see when Flagg dribbled around defender Quion Burns, curled into the paint and took off from just outside the charge circle to throw down a full-extension dunk with his right hand.",
      "Flagg's night ended abruptly when he landed awkwardly in traffic on the baseline and stayed down with 3:28 left due to cramps, with trainer Jose Fonseca coming over to briefly work on his left leg. But Flagg soon hobbled back to the bench to watch the final minutes while chugging from a Gatorade water battle.",
      "Afterward, Scheyer said he was glad to hear that Flagg could \u201cadmit and say he was emotional\u201d about playing against Maine with all the ties to the program. And to listen to Black Bears coach Chris Markwood, the feeling was mutual in being on hand for the next step of Flagg's \u201cstorybook\u201d journey from small-town Maine to one of college basketball's famed arenas.",
      "\u201cI think we're a little bit in awe because you just don't see it happen a lot in the state of Maine,\" Markwood said. \"He's got a whole state behind him. Everybody is just cheering him along and can't wait to watch everything he does.\u201d",

    "summary": "The College Football Playoff selection committee will release its first rankings of the season on Tuesday night",
    "story": [
      "The College Football Playoff selection committee will release its first rankings of the season on Tuesday night",
      "After two months of college football comes the first chance to see if committee members in charge of setting the new, 12-team bracket for the playoff have been watching the same season unfold as everyone else.",
      "If they have, then Oregon \u2014 undefeated and a unanimous No. 1 in the latest AP Top 25 \u2014 will get top billing when the first of six sets of weekly rankings are revealed Tuesday evening.",
      "If not, then who would they pick? Miami, BYU and Indiana are the nation's top undefeated teams alongside the Ducks, but one thing the committee has made clear is that wins and losses are only one factor in determining its top 25. That list will eventually be used to slot teams into the final bracket that will be unveiled Dec. 8.",
      "Strength of schedule will also play a big factor and would account for teams with one loss, setting the table for the likes of Ohio State and Georgia potentially being ranked higher than the unbeaten.",
      "The playoff is expanding from four to 12 teams this year, college football's latest attempt to find a perfect way to crown a champion. That the expanded playoff adds eight more games that were then sold to ESPN for $7.8 billion certainly played a big role in these calculations.",
      "A committee of 13 people will pore over the results from the first 10 weeks of the season and rank the teams from 1 through 25. This is just a starting point, because none of these rankings are solidified until Dec. 8 \u2014 the date of the last poll, at which point the teams will be slotted into the bracket based on their ranking.",
      "Well, not exactly. The five best-ranked conference champions are guaranteed spots in the playoff no matter where they're slotted in the poll. And the top four are guaranteed first-round byes.",
      "So, for instance, let's say BYU wins the Big 12 and was ranked ninth by the CFP (that is its ranking in this week's AP poll). That means BYU would automatically move up to No. 4 in the CFP bracket, since the top four conference champs get byes. And if, for instance, Boise State wins the Mountain West, is ranked lower than 12 by the CFP but no other Group of Five school is ranked ahead of the Broncos, they would make the playoff anyway.",
      "There are seven at-large selections and no limit to the number of at-large bids a conference can receive.",
      "If Oregon isn't placed atop the standings, then the committee is watching a different sport than the rest of us. The Ducks have beaten five Big Ten opponents by three touchdowns or more and also have a one-point victory over Ohio State, ranked third by AP.",
      "It will be interesting to see what the committee does with Notre Dame, an independent with no way to win a conference (and a bye) that is 7-1 but also has a home loss to Northern Illinois in Week 2 on its resume.",
      "Also, Indiana is 9-0 and not finding much resistance on its less-than-brutal Big Ten schedule. Doubters will be looking at that Nov. 23 matchup against Ohio State.",
      "Once the bracket is set Dec. 8, here is what comes next:",
      "\u2014 Seeds five through eight will host seeds nine through 12 in first-round games on campus. Those games will be played on Dec. 20 (one game) and Dec. 21 (three).",
      "\u2014 The quarterfinals will be played in traditional bowl games on Dec. 31 (Fiesta Bowl) and Jan. 1 (Peach, Rose, Sugar). Where the top four seeds will be aligned as closely as possible with current and traditional bowl tie-ins. For example, the Big Ten champion would play in the Rose Bowl and the SEC champion likely plays in the Sugar Bowl.",
      "\u2014 The semifinals will also be played in bowl games. This season, that\u2019s Jan. 9 at the Orange Bowl and Jan. 10 at the Cotton Bowl.",
      "\u2014 The championship game will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20.",

    "summary": "The PGA Tour is likely to change eligibility for how many players get full cards",
    "story": [
      "The PGA Tour is likely to change eligibility for how many players get full cards",
      "The reason behind such a big change to PGA Tour eligibility is not much different from what it was some 40 years ago. Both were about trying to make the tour more competitive and to give real value to having a card.",
      "Of course, it involved money, too. That never changes.",
      "The PGA Tour board later this month will vote on whether to reduce the number of fully exempt players from 125 to 100, along with cutting from 30 to 20 the tour cards awarded to top finishers on the Korn Ferry Tour.",
      "It sounds even more cutthroat than golf already is, especially since it was in 1983 when the PGA Tour went the other direction.",
      "It used to be only the top 60 on the money list the previous year were exempt from qualifying for PGA Tour events. That changed to the top 125 in what became known as the all-exempt tour. Anyone who had a tour card could expect to tee it up just about wherever he wanted, instead of having to qualify every Monday.",
      "Those who didn't make it through qualifying put their clubs in the trunk and headed to the next stop. Back then, getting a PGA Tour card was the easy part.",
      "So the change wasn't about the rich getting richer. It was having a reasonable chance to make a good living.",
      "\u201cReally, when you get down to it, there aren't very many of us who make any money out here,\u201d the late Tom Weiskopf said at the start of the 1982 season. Craig Stadler wound up leading the money list that year with $446,462. Only 37 players topped $100,000 in earnings.",
      "\u201cThe all-exempt tour will give more people a chance to play more tournaments,\" Weiskopf said. \"There will be more people making money and, with 150 players able to play any time they want to, you're going to see the competitive level of the game go up.\u201d",
      "That's the idea behind the proposal the PGA Tour board is considering \u2014 and is likely to approve \u2014 when it meets in two weeks.",
      "With such a bloated membership, having a tour card often meant waiting until there was room to play. The regular season is three months shorter, so there is more urgency to play. Now factor in 125 cards, plus two-year exemptions to players who win, plus 30 cards for the Korn Ferry Tour, 10 cards for leading European tour members, five cards from Q-school, career money exemptions, medical exemptions. Whew.",
      "Not to be overlooked were the eight signature events with even smaller fields.",
      "More waiting.",
      "The reduction in cards \u2014 the change would take effect in 2026 \u2014 should be beneficial, at least for those who finish in the top 100 to keep full status.",
      "There is still the concept of meritocracy. Justin Thomas went from winning a major in 2022 to failing to qualify for the postseason in 2023. Matt McCarty started this year on the Korn Ferry Tour, won three times for an instant promotion and then won the Black Desert Championship in Utah to earn a two-year exemption and a spot in three majors next year.",
      "It's not going to be easy, nor is it supposed to be.",
      "There's an advantage for players who finished in the top 50 \u2014 a perk for success is another way to look at it \u2014 because they are guaranteed spots in all the signature events with a $20 million purse and elevated FedEx Cup points.",
      "The answer, of course, is to play better. It's a phrase no one likes to hear because it's true.",
      "\u201cTrust me, players hate hearing that,\u201d said Camilo Villegas, chairman of the 16-member Player Advisory Council that put forth the proposed changes. \u201cBut go to any sport, go to the business world, you've got to perform. If we perform, there's an opportunity to make an unbelievable living. You just keep working on your dream like you did when you were a kid.\u201d",
      "J.T. Poston, who won three weeks ago in Las Vegas, put a different spin on \u201cplay better.\u201d He was curious at the start of 2023 about how the signature events were going to work.",
      "For Poston, it was all about having the ball in his hand and his name on a tee sheet.",
      "\u201cAs long as there's a way you still have to perform to stay in, and there's an avenue for guys who aren't in to play their way in, I don't think there's an issue,\u201d Poston said.",
      "Golf still remains a mess. Top names have defected to Saudi-funded LIV Golf, meaning all the stars are together only four times a year at the majors. Even as the PGA Tour and the Public Investment Fund get closer to an investment deal, getting everyone back together more often remains complicated.",
      "With golf, it's always something.",
      "Even as the PGA Tour was moving to the all-exempt tour in 1983, one of the proposals was for a \u201csuper tour\u201d of 20 or 25 events with big purses (back then it was in the $400,000 range, which sounds like chump change in today's golf economy).",
      "A group of Dallas business contemplated a rival circuit for champions 40 and older, which never got off the ground. The tour created the \u201cTournament Players Series\u201d for players who didn't have full cards and for PGA club pros who had lost access to those Monday qualifiers.",
      "For such a virtuous sport, strife is never far behind. What hasn't changed is the best players find a way. All they need is a tee time. They still have that.",

      "\u201cIn a heated moment, I decided to greet hate with hate,\u201d Kelce said before ESPN's broadcast of the Buccaneers-Chiefs game featuring his brother, Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce. \u201cI fell short this week.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce was attending the Big Ten matchup between the Buckeyes and Nittany Lions in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday when the incident occurred. Video on social media showed him walking through a crowd near Beaver Stadium and fans asking for photos and fist bumps when one fan began to heckle him and appeared to shout an anti-gay slur directed toward his brother for dating Taylor Swift.",
      "At that point, Kelce grabbed the fan's phone and threw it to the ground, then turned to confront the man dressed in Penn State attire. Kelce appeared to use the same anti-gay slur during the exchange before another fan stepped between them before the altercation could escalate.",
      "\u201cI think everybody has seen on social media what happened this week,\u201d Kelce said on the ESPN broadcast. \"Listen, I\u2019m not happy with anything that took place. I\u2019m not proud of it. In a heated moment I chose to greet hate with hate and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s a productive thing, I really don\u2019t.

      "Nothing went right in Derek Carr's return to the New Orleans Saints' lineup in Week 9",
      "Derek Carr's return to the New Orleans Saints' starting lineup couldn't have gone much worse.",
      "He lost his top target to a concussion when his pass over the middle sailed over his receiver. He lost to the worst team in the league and he became the first NFL quarterback to lose to 31 teams.",
      "A day later, he lost his head coach.",
      "These are not the Saints of Sean Payton and Drew Brees, to be sure. But Carr and Dennis Allen expeditiously raised hopes of parading another Lombardi Trophy down Bourbon Street when the Saints totaled 91 points in back-to-back blowouts of Carolina and Dallas to start the season.",
      "They scored on their first nine possessions in a 47-10 rout of the Panthers in the opener, then topped that a week later at Jerry World when they reached the end zone on their first half-dozen drives in a 44-19 jaw-dropper against the Cowboys.",
      "Those were heady times \u2014 and, as it turned out, fleeting.",
      "The Saints have lost seven straight games since Week 2 amid a flurry of injuries, including a strained oblique that sent Carr to the sideline for three weeks.",
      "Four of those losses were by double digits, among them a 33-10 Thursday night whooping from Payton and his new team, the resurgent Denver Broncos.",
      "The costliest loss was the Saints' 23-22 defeat in Charlotte on Sunday when Carr couldn't lead his team into field-goal range in the final minute and the Saints left town with the same 2-7 record as the Panthers, a team that's statistically dreadful and historically bad.",
      "So, Dennis Allen, who was previously fired by the then-Oakland Raiders in 2014, on Monday became the first coach in NFL history fired twice with the same quarterback starting both teams.",
      "In a written statement released by the team, Allen thanked team owner Gayle Benson and GM Mickey Loomis for his opportunity and said, \u201cI am sorry the results weren\u2019t better, because they were certainly deserved.\u201d",
      "Allen is the second NFL coach fired midseason in 2024. Jeff Ulbrich replaced Robert Saleh as interim coach after the Jets' 2-3 start and it took him a month to get his first victory.",
      "The caretaker in New Orleans is Darren Rizzi, who gets the Browns (2-7) at home in two weeks and the Giants (2-7) on the road in four, but he inherited a beat-up team and a quarterback who was eviscerated by former teammate Michael Thomas on social media after wide receiver Chris Olave's concussion Sunday.",
      "As he cut across the middle and reached for Carr's errant pass, Olave was sandwiched by safety Xavier Woods and cornerback Dane Jackson. While Woods was flagged for unnecessary roughness, Olave remained on the field for several minutes being attended to by trainers as the crowd went silent and players from both teams gathered around him. He was eventually placed on a backboard and taken to a hospital by ambulance.",
      "Thomas immediately castigated Carr on social media, saying Carr tends to \"just panic and throw the ball.\u201d He also reposted another message on X that suggested Carr should be fined for throwing a \u201chospital pass.\u201d",
      "Carr spoke for more than four minutes about Thomas\u2019 comments after the game.",
      "\u201cI have a pit in my stomach any time one of my teammates goes down because I love them that much,\u201d Carr said. \u201cNo matter if I like them or not, and I happen to love Chris Olave. We have a great relationship. I hate, and I don\u2019t like to use that word a lot, but I hate moments like that.\u201d",
      "Carr said Thomas, who has criticized Carr on social media before, seems to be the one teammate who hasn't gotten along with him in the NFL.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to him,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he feels that way. I\u2019m sorry for whatever he\u2019s dealing with to make him feel like he\u2019s got do that. But he\u2019s never called me during all of this. My phone number has never changed. I\u2019ve in fact called him on different occasions just to try. Sometimes, you can try as hard as you want and it doesn\u2019t work out. And that\u2019s OK. ... But I wish him the best. I hope he gets on a team and does what he wants to do and loves it.\u201d",
      "Woods said after the game he didn\u2019t think it was a malicious hit, but officials told him he was penalized for hitting Olave in the head. \u201cIt was nothing dirty on my part, I was just playing football,\u201d Woods said.",
      "Entering the weekend, Carr was one of 10 QBs to have lost to 30 different teams, a club that includes Brees, Brett Favre, Joe Flacco and Matt Ryan. Now, Carr stands alone as the only QB to lose to 31 teams.",
      "The only team he hasn\u2019t lost to is his old team, the Raiders, whom the Saints host on Dec. 29.",
      "Another mea culpa came when former Eagles center Jason Kelce began ESPN's broadcast of \u201cMonday Night Countdown\" by acknowledging he shouldn't have returned an anti-gay slur to a Penn State football fan who heckled him Saturday about his brother, Travis, dating Taylor Swift.",
      "\u201cIn a heated moment, I chose to greet hate with hate,\u201d Jason Kelce said. \u201cAnd I don't think that's a productive thing.\u201d",
      "Whatever happened to the axiom that you play for the tie at home and the win on the road?",
      "The Buccaneers lost 30-24 at Kansas City in overtime Monday night after Tampa Bay coach Todd Bowles decided to go for the tie rather than the win following Baker Mayfield's touchdown throw with 27 seconds left in regulation.",

      "It wound up being a good night for both of them.",
      "Swift was able to celebrate Kelce's big night, which included 14 catches for 100 yards in a driving rain, along with a victory for the Chiefs. They trailed by a touchdown in the fourth quarter, scored twice to take the lead, then headed to overtime, where they won the coin toss and drove for a touchdown that gave them a 30-24 win.",
      "Kelce, who had fumbled earlier in the game, had two of his catches on the decisive drive in overtime. His total receptions was a career-best for a regular-season game, matching a 14-catch performance in a 2023 playoff win over Jacksonville, while his 16 targets from Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was just one shy of his career high.",
      "\u201cHe does a great job of finding space,\u201d Mahomes said, \u201cand I think with having DeAndre (Hopkins) out there, it takes pressure off where not all the attention is on him the entire time. And whenever he gets going, man, he's hard to stop.\u201d",

      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.",
      "Swift's arrival in a black outfit and Chiefs coat Monday night came on the eve of the presidential election, in which the 14-time Grammy winner has thrown her support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. That generated a stir when Harris' rival, Donald Trump, began to reference Swift's friend and Mahomes' wife, Brittany, as a supporter of his campaign.",

      "NEW YORK -- Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid was suspended by the NBA on Tuesday for three games without pay for shoving a member of the media.",
      "Embiid\u2019s suspension will begin with the next regular-season game for which he is eligible and able to play. The 2023 NBA MVP has yet to play this season because of what the 76ers call left knee management.",
      "The Sixers begin a road trip in Los Angeles against the Clippers on Wednesday night.",
      "Embiid shouted at and eventually shoved a newspaper columnist in a locker room altercation Saturday night.",
      "\"Mutual respect is paramount to the relationship between players and media in the NBA,\u201d league executive Joe Dumars said in a statement announcing the suspension. \u201cWhile we understand Joel was offended by the personal nature of the original version of the reporter\u2019s column, interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical.\u201d",
      "Embiid took issue with Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes, who mentioned the seven-time All-Star's late brother and his son \u2014 both named Arthur \u2014 in columns questioning Embiid\u2019s professionalism and effort not being in shape after playing in the Paris Olympics.",
      "As reporters entered the locker room to talk to players following a 124-107 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, the two-time NBA scoring champion stood and confronted Hayes.",
      "\u201cThe next time you bring up my dead brother and my son again, you are going to see what I\u2019m going to do to you and I\u2019m going to have to ... live with the consequences,\u201d Embiid said to Hayes.",
      "Embiid continued, with several instances of profanity in the next few sentences. Hayes offered an apology, which Embiid did not want. \u201cThat\u2019s not the f\u2014\u2014\u2014 first time,\u201d Embiid said.",
      "Embiid later said that he doesn\u2019t care what reporters say. \u201cBut you do,\u201d Hayes answered.",
      "Embiid appeared to get louder at that point, and not long afterward pushed Hayes on the shoulder while the team\u2019s public relations chief got between them. Another PR person moved Tyrese Maxey\u2019s interview to the hallway outside the locker room, trying to clear reporters.",
      "Embiid was the No. 3 pick in the 2014 draft but missed his first two full seasons with injuries. Since his first full season in 2016, he has played in 433 of a possible 805 regular-season games and only 59 of 67 possible playoff games.",

      "Mike Williams struggled to establish a rapport with Aaron Rodgers on the New York Jets",
      "Mike Williams struggled to establish a rapport with Aaron Rodgers on the New York Jets.",
      "The Pittsburgh Steelers think the veteran wide receiver will fit in just fine with Russell Wilson and their offense.",
      "The teams announced Tuesday that the Jets agreed to trade Williams to the Steelers for a fifth-round pick in next year's draft, pending a physical.",
      "Williams struggled with production and building an on-field connection with Rodgers in his first season with New York. He became expendable when the Jets acquired Davante Adams from Las Vegas last month.",
      "Williams, who signed a one-year, $10 million contract with New York in the offseason as a free agent, had just 12 catches for 166 yards in nine games with the Jets. He had only a 6-yard reception on just two targets in his last two games.",
      "He heads from the scuffling Jets (3-6) to the first-place Steelers (6-2), who have been searching for a complement to top wideout George Pickens for months.",
      "\u201cMike's a good guy,\u201d Rodgers said during his weekly appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d just as news of the trade was being reported. \u201cHe'll be good in that locker room. ... He's had a nice career, and sometimes a change of scenery is great for certain guys. It was great for me to kind of get re-enthused and stuff.",
      "\u201cWe kind of knew with Davante coming in, there would be less targets for everybody.\u201d",
      "The addition of Williams also gives the Steelers a big red zone target for Wilson, along with Pickens and tight end Pat Freiermuth. While Van Jefferson and Calvin Austin III have seen their production tick up since Wilson returned after missing the first six games with a calf injury, both lack Williams' size and his resume.",
      "\u201cIf this gives Mike more opportunities, that's awesome,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cWe wish Mike well.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-4 Williams spent his first seven NFL seasons with the Chargers, for whom he caught 309 passes for 4,806 yards and 31 touchdowns. He tore the ACL in his right knee in Week 3 last year and missed the rest of the season. The Jets brought Williams along slowly throughout the offseason and in training camp, but he never seemed to click with Rodgers when he got onto the field.",
      "\u201cMike\u2019s a quiet guy, just kind of goes about his business,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cMike had a rough injury last year, an ACL. That's tough to come back from and he worked his (butt) off all last season. He wasn't around for a lot of training camp and was working on the side. But I felt like he was getting better throughout the early part of the season. I felt like his speed was getting better and starting to feel more comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "In New York's 23-20 loss to Buffalo on Oct. 14, Rodgers threw to Williams during the final few minutes \u2014 but was intercepted when Taron Johnson intercepted the pass that was short of Williams and sealed the loss for the Jets. Rodgers later said Williams ran the wrong route. The wide receiver said he wasn't bothered by the quarterback's criticism and said the two spoke about it.",
      "But Williams then became the subject of trade rumors, especially after he sat out the first two days of practice that week with what the Jets said were \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d",
      "Six days after New York's loss to Buffalo, Williams caught a 15-yard pass in a 37-15 loss in Pittsburgh. And now he'll be playing for those Steelers.",
      "Pittsburgh has been looking for another outside receiver to put opposite Pickens since the team traded Diontae Johnson to Carolina in the offseason. The Steelers missed out on Brandon Aiyuk \u2014 who opted to remain in San Francisco \u2014 and couldn't land Adams or DeAndre Hopkins when both became available.",
      "Steelers coach Mike Tomlin acknowledged the team was looking to upgrade its roster in general for the stretch run, but also made it a point to acknowledge the rise in the quality of play of Austin and Jefferson.",
      "\u201cI just feel like we have a group that\u2019s hardworking and capable and can\u2019t wait to show the football world those capabilities,\u201d Tomlin said Tuesday shortly before the trade. \"And every time we step into a stadium, they get an opportunity to do so. And you seen some examples of it already.\u201d",
      "Just not enough to resist the chance to bring in Williams for a relatively low cost.",
      "The move actually leaves the Jets a bit short-handed at wide receiver. New York still has starters Adams and Garrett Wilson, along with backups Xavier Gipson, special teamer Irvin Charles and rookie Malachi Corley, who had his first NFL touchdown run overturned last Thursday night against Houston when he dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line.",
      "Allen Lazard, who had 30 receptions for 412 yards and is tied with Wilson with a team-leading five touchdown catches, is on IR with a chest injury.",

As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",

      "The commission said then that the two companies didn\u2019t clearly inform users or obtain their consent to collect data about them as they used other websites or services outside their own platforms. It ordered the companies to provide an \u201ceasy and clear\u201d consent process to give people more control over whether to share information about what they do online.",

      "Conservationists and a Native American advocacy group are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014",

      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it survived a massive earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant has been shut down again due to an equipment problem",
      "TOKYO -- A Japanese nuclear reactor that restarted last week for the first time in more than 13 years after it had survived a massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that badly damaged the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant was shut down again Monday due to an equipment problem, its operator said.",
      "The No. 2 reactor at the Onagawa nuclear power plant on Japan\u2019s northern coast was put back online on Oct. 29 and had been expected to start generating power in early November.",
      "But it had to be shut down again five days after its restart due to a glitch that occurred Sunday in a device related to neutron data inside the reactor, plant operator Tohoku Electric Power Co. said.",
      "The reactor was operating normally and there was no release of radiation into the environment, Tohoku Electric said. The utility said it decided to shut it down to re-examine equipment to address residents' safety concerns. No new date for a restart was given.",
      "The reactor is one of three at the Onagawa plant, which is 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of the Fukushima Daiichi plant where three reactors melted following a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, releasing large amounts of radiation.",
      "The Onagawa plant was hit by a 13-meter (42-foot) tsunami triggered by the quake but was able to keep its crucial cooling systems functioning in all three reactors and achieve their safe shutdowns.",
      "All of Japan\u2019s 54 commercial nuclear power plants were shut down after the Fukushima disaster for safety checks and upgrades. Onagawa No. 2 was the 13th of the 33 still useable reactors to restart.",
      "Japan's government last year adopted a plan to maximize use of nuclear energy and is pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024. killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. It caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate."

      "It\u2019s one of the most under-publicized policies of some of the biggest U.S. retailers: sometimes they give customers full refunds and let them keep unwanted items too.",
      "Returnless refunds are a tool that more retailers are using to keep online shoppers happy and to reduce shipping fees, processing time and other ballooning costs from returned products.",
      "Companies such as Amazon, Walmart and Target have decided some items are not worth the cost or hassle of getting back. Think a $20 T-shirt that might cost $30 in shipping and handling to recover. There are also single-use items, such as a package of plastic straws, that might be difficult to resell or medicines that could be unsafe to market again.",
      "Analysts say the companies offering returnless refunds do it somewhat sporadically, typically reserving the option for low-cost objects or ones with limited resale value. But some online shoppers said they've also been allowed to keep more pricey products.",
      "Dalya Harel, 48, received a return-free refund recently after ordering a desk from Amazon that cost roughly $300. When the desk arrived, she noticed it was missing some key pieces and would be impossible to put together, Harel said. She couldn't request a replacement and have it within a reasonable time for the office of her New York lice detection removal service because the item was out of stock.",
      "Harel, who routinely buys towels and other products from Amazon for her business, said her team reached out to the company's customer service line. She was pleasantly surprised to hear she would get a refund without having to send back the desk.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one less headache to deal with,\u201d Harel said. \u201cIt was really nice for us to not have to make an extra trip up to the post office.\u201d",
      "She used the desk pieces to create makeshift shelves in her office in Brooklyn.",
      "While the retail practice of letting customers keep merchandise and get their money back is not exactly a trade secret, the way it works is shrouded in mystery. Companies are not keen to publicize the circumstances in which they issue returnless refunds due to concerns over the potential for return fraud.",
      "Even if brands don't provide details about such policies on their websites, returnless refunds are expanding in at least some retail corners.",
      "Amazon, which industry experts say has engaged in the practice for years, announced in August that it would extend the option to the third-party sellers who drive most of the sales on the e-commerce giant's platform. Under the program, sellers who use the company\u2019s fulfillment services in the U.S. could choose to offer customers a traditional refund for purchases under $75 along with no obligation to return what they ordered.",
      "Amazon did not immediately respond to questions about how the program works. But publicly, it has pitched returnless refunds more directly to international sellers and those who offer cheaper goods. Items sold in an upcoming section of Amazon's website, which will allow U.S. shoppers to buy low-cost goods shipped directly from China, will also be eligible for returnless refunds, according to documents seen by The Associated Press.",
      "In January, Walmart gave a similar option to merchants who sell products on its growing online marketplace, leaving it up to sellers to set price limits and determine if or how they want to participate.",
      "China-founded e-commerce companies Shein and Temu say they also offer returnless refunds on a small number of orders, as does Target, the online shopping site Overstock and pet products e-tailer Chewy, which some customer said had encouraged them to donate unwanted items to local animal shelters.",
      "Wayfair, another online retailer cited by some customers as offering returnless refunds, did not reply to a request for comment on its policies.",
      "Overall, retailers and brands tend to be careful about how often they let customers keep items for free. Many of them are deploying algorithms to determine who should be given the option and who should not.",
      "To make the decision, the algorithms assess multiple factors, including the extent to which a shopper should be trusted based on prior purchasing \u2013 and returning \u2013 patterns, shipping costs and the demand for the product in the customer\u2019s hands, according to Sender Shamiss, CEO of goTRG, a reverse logistics company that works with retailers like Walmart.",
      "Optoro, a company that helps streamline returns for Best Buy, Staples and Gap Inc., has observed retailers assessing the lifetime value of a customer and extending returnless refunds as a type of unofficial, discreet loyalty benefit, according to CEO Amena Ali.",
      "The king of online retail appeared to verify the process works that way.",
      "In a statement, Amazon said it offers returnless refunds on a \u201cvery small number\u201d of items as a \u201cconvenience to customers.\u201d",
      "The company also said it's hearing positive feedback from sellers about its new program that authorized them to tell customers they could keep some products and still be reimbursed. Amazon said it was monitoring for signs of fraud and setting eligibility criteria for sellers and customers. It didn't provide additional details on what that encompassed.",
      "Some retailers also are stiffening the liberal return policies they long employed to encourage online orders. Shoppers who enjoyed making purchases on their computers or cellphones became accustomed to loading up their digital shopping baskets with the intent of returning items they ended up not liking.",
      "Shopping online also grew significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when homebound consumers reduced their trips to stores and relied on sites like Amazon for everyday items. Retail companies have talked in recent years about returns becoming more expensive to process due to the growing volume, rising inflation and labor costs.",
      "Last year, U.S. consumers returned $743 billion worth of merchandise, or 14.5% of the products they purchased - up from 10.6% in 2020, according to the National Retail Federation. In 2019, returned merchandise was valued at $309 billion, according to loss prevention company Appriss Retail.",
      "Last year, roughly 14% of returns were fraudulent, costing retailers $101 billion in losses, according to a joint report from the National Retail federation and Appriss Retail. The problem spans from low-level forms of fraud - such as shoppers returning already worn clothing - to more complicated schemes by fraudsters who return shoplifted merchandise or items purchased on stolen credit cards.",
      "To deter excessive returns, some retailers, including H&M, Zara and J. Crew, started charging customers return fees in the past year. Others have shortened their return windows. Some shopping sites, such as the Canadian retailer Ssense, have threatened to kick frequent returners off their platforms if they suspect abuse of their policies.",
      "However, retailers don't all view frequent returners in the same way. Such customers could be seen as \u201cgood returners\u201d if they purchase \u2013 and keep \u2013 many more items than they send back, Ali said.",
      "\u201cOftentimes, your most profitable customers tend to be high returners,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
    "story": [
      "For some television viewers, size apparently does matter",
      "NEW YORK -- For some television viewers, size apparently does matter.",
      "Forget the 65-inch TVs that were considered bigger than average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 8 feet diagonally. That's wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a king-size bed.",
      "Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year, according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise tepid television market, according to analysts.",
      "The 38,100 televisions of at least 97 inches sold between January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation\u2019s largest consumer electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs \u2014 the 19 models range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 \u2014 and introduced displays in roughly 70% of its stores.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really taken off this year,\" Blake Hampton, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising, said.",
      "Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at least 97 inches was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its first 98-inch TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.",
      "Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling business, recently bought a 98-inch Sony for his 14,000-square-foot house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 85-inch TV in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home and uses some to display digital art.",
      "\u201cWe just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking for and thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony. \u201cYou get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You\u2019re sitting watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can put yourself in the scene.\u201d",
      "The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through September period, Circana said.",
      "Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski, the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a year, Kowalski said.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of two inches in both 2021 and 2022, and 85-inch TVs began gaining traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 98-inch TVs to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 110-115 inches are on the market right now, he said.",
      "\u201cYou get better resolution over time,\" Kowalski said. \"You get better picture quality. And so just over time, it\u2019s easier to produce those sets and improve the technology.\"",
      "Best Buy's Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re watching YouTube TV content or \u2018 NFL Sunday Ticket,\u2019 you can actually get four screens up, and that\u2019s four 48-inch screens on it,\u201d he said.",
      "Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed its 98-inch lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every scene.",
      "James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment division of Samsung's U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and experience content is shifting.",
      "\u201cIt's even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,\u201d Fishler said. \u201cThey want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at home. \u201d",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, its Sam\u2019s Club division, and Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.",
      "TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach on home theater projectors, which create a 100- to 120-inch image that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without windows.",
      "\u201cA dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the purview of projectors,\u201d Andrew Sivori, vice president in the entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer. \"But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.\"",
      "Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd. But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, \u201cIt\u2019s still a niche business.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t have the space to put one of those in,\u201d he added.",
      "Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make sure a 98-inch TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.",
      "But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good news is that the recommended distance for a 98-inch TV is actually just 6-12 feet from the seating area. The rule of thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine the ideal viewing distance, Samsung's Fishler said.",
      "If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?",
      "\u201cI think we'll have to wait and see,\u201d Fishler said.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov. 3, 2024. It was updated on Nov. 5, 2024 to correct that TV sizes are measured on the diagonal, not by width.",

      "The eruption at Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki around midnight spewed thick brownish ash as high as 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) into the air and hot ashes hit several villages, burning down houses including a convent of Catholic nuns, said Firman Yosef, an official at the Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki monitoring post.",
      "He said volcanic material was thrown up to 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, blanketing nearby villages and towns with tons of volcanic debris and forcing residents to flee.",
      "Rescuers were still searching for more bodies buried under collapsed houses, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Management Agency\u2019s spokesperson. Muhari said all the bodies, including a child, were found with a 4-kilometer (2.4 mile) radius of the crater.",
      "He said at least 10,000 people have been affected by the eruption in six villages of Wulanggitang District, and four villages in Ile Bura district. Some have fled to relatives\u2019 houses while the local government is readying schools to use as temporary shelters.",
      "The country\u2019s volcano monitoring agency increased the volcano\u2019s alert status to the highest level and more than doubled the exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius after midnight on Monday as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "A nun in Hokeng village died and another was missing, said Agusta Palma, the head of the Saint Gabriel Foundation that oversees convents on the majority-Catholic island.",
      "\u201cOur nuns ran out in panic under a rain of volcanic ash in the darkness,\u201d Palma said.",
      "Photos and videos circulated on social media showed tons of volcanic debris covering houses up to their rooftops in villages like Hokeng, where hot volcanic material set fire to houses.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of a pair of stratovolcanoes in the East Flores district of East Nusa Tenggara province known locally as the husband \u2014 \u201cLaki-laki\u201d means man \u2014 and wife mountains. Its mate is Lewotobi Perempuan, or woman.",
      "About 6,500 people were evacuated in January after Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki began erupting, spewing thick clouds and forcing the government to close the island's Frans Seda Airport. No casualties or major damage were reported, but the airport has remained closed since then due to seismic activity.",
      "In a video conference on Monday, Muhammad Wafid, the head of Geology Agency at the Energy and Mineral Resources ministry said there was a different character between January\u2019s eruption and Monday\u2019s eruption due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure.",
      "\u201cThe eruptions that occurred since Friday were due to the accumulation of hidden energy,\u201d Wafid said.",
      "It\u2019s Indonesia\u2019s second volcanic eruption in as many weeks. West Sumatra province\u2019s Mount Marapi, one of the country\u2019s most active volcanos, erupted on Oct. 27, spewing thick columns of ash at least three times and blanketing nearby villages with debris, but no casualties were reported.",
      "Lewotobi Laki-laki is one of the 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of 280 million people. The country is prone to earthquakes, landslides and volcanic activity because it sits along the \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. ___",

      "BEIJING -- Three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Monday after a six-month stay on the Tiangong space station, part of China\u2019s effort to be a global leader in space exploration.",
      "A parachute slowed their capsule's nighttime descent to a remote landing area in China's Inner Mongolia region. The crew emerged after touching down at 1:24 a.m. A Chinese national flag stuck in the ground near the capsule flapped in the wind.",
      "In recent years, the country's space program has brought back rocks from the moon and landed a rover on Mars. It aims to put a person on the moon by 2030, which would make China the second nation after the United States to do so.",
      "The space station astronauts returned after welcoming a replacement three-person crew last week for the latest six-month mission. The new team of one woman and two men will conduct experiments, carry out spacewalks and install equipment to protect the station from space debris.",
      "A space agency official said in April that Tiangong had maneuvered several times to avoid debris and had partially lost power when the solar wing's power cables were hit by debris, according to a report from the official Xinhua News Agency.",
      "China is among the countries that have created space debris, including the reported break-up of a rocket stage in August during the launch of the first 18 satellites for a global internet service similar to Starlink, the still-growing constellation of satellites operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Tiangong, which means Heavenly Palace, was completed two years ago and orbits the earth.",
      "Only Chinese astronauts have gone to the space station so far, but a space agency spokesperson said last week that China is in discussions to select and train astronauts from other nations to join the missions, Xinhua reported.",
      "Astronauts from several nations have traveled to the International Space Station, but China is blocked from that program mainly because of U.S. concerns over the military's involvement in China's space program.",
      "China laid out an ambitious plan last month to become a leader in space science research by 2050 in conjunction with its advances in space exploration."

      "To be a parent in the Ukrainian front-line city of Zaporizhzhia means weighing your child\u2019s life against the Russian weapons within striking distance",
      "ZAPORIZHZHIA, Ukraine -- To be a parent in the Ukrainian front-line city of Zaporizhzhia means weighing your child\u2019s life against the Russian weapons within striking distance.",
      "Most rain death in an instant: the drones, the ballistic missiles, the glide bombs, the artillery shells. But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",
      "The NPP, as it\u2019s known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other.",
      "These twin dangers \u2014 bombs and radiation \u2014 shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic more than four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022.",
      "So with missiles and bombs still striking daily, Zaporizhzhia is going on a building binge for its future, creating an underground school system.",
      "Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students. Then, officials say, they will start on the hospital system.",
      "The daily bombs are a more tangible fear than radiation, said Kateryna Ryzhko, a mother whose children are the third generation in her family to attend School No. 88. The main building, dating to the Soviet era of the children\u2019s grandmother, is immaculate but the classrooms are empty. The underground version is nearly complete, and Ryzhko said she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to send her kids to class there. Nearly four years of online learning have taken their toll on kids and parents alike.",
      "\u201cEven classmates don\u2019t recognize each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only safe way to have an education and not be on screens.\u201d",
      "Within days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia\u2019s 300,000 residents found themselves on the front lines. Unlike larger Ukrainian cities, like Kyiv or Kharkiv, there is no subway system that could do double-duty as a bomb shelter and few schools had basements where students could more safely attend classes.",
      "Many residents left \u2014 though some have returned. But the single-family homes and Soviet-style apartment blocks of Zaporizhzhia, the capital of the region that shares its name, filled nearly as quickly with Ukrainians fleeing areas seized by Russian forces, like the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Berdyansk.",
      "By the start of the school year in September 2022, which was supposed to mark the post-pandemic return to classrooms, schools were empty. Windows were boarded up to protect against bomb shockwaves, the lawns left unkempt. Fifty kilometers (31 miles) away, the nuclear reactor went into cold shutdown after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government.",
      "The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since. There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle.",
      "The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems.",
      "During a recent Associated Press trip to the Ukrainian-controlled zone closest to the nuclear plant, two airborne bombs struck electrical infrastructure in a matter of minutes as night fell. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine\u2019s grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire. It was at least the seventh time this year that the plant was down to either a single electrical line or generator power, according to the global Nuclear Energy Agency.",
      "\u201cNuclear power plants are not meant to be disconnected from the grid. It\u2019s not designed for that. It\u2019s also not designed to be operating in cold shutdown for that long,\u201d said Darya Dolzikova, a researcher on nuclear policy at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. The 1986 meltdown in Ukraine\u2019s Chornobyl, on the northern border nearly 900 kilometers (550 miles) from Zaporizhzhia, increased the country\u2019s rates of thyroid disease among Ukrainian children far from the accident site and radiation contaminated the immediate surroundings before drifting over much of the Northern Hemisphere. To this day, the area around the plant, known in Russian as Chernobyl, is an \u201cexclusion zone\u201d off-limits except to the technical staff needed to keep the decommissioned site safe.",
      "Russian forces seized control of Chornobyl in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces.",
      "The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl and there\u2019s not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn\u2019t reduce the risk to zero, and Russia will remain a threatening neighbor even after the war ends.",
      "An investment that might seem extreme elsewhere is more understandable in Ukraine, said Sam Lair, a researcher at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies.",
      "\u201cThey are there under a conventional air and missile attack from the Russians, and they have experience with the fact that those attacks aren\u2019t being targeted only at military targets,\u201d Lair said. \u201cIf I were in their position, I would be building them too.\u201d",
      "In addition, the Zaporizhzhia region received a European Union donation of 5.5 million iodine pills, which help block the thyroid\u2019s absorption of some radiation.",
      "Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a \u201ccritical threat to our sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine\u2019s electricity.",
      "\u201cIf, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, radiation won\u2019t respect state borders,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous \u2014 the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army.",
      "\u201cEverybody understands that fortification and aid for the army, it\u2019s priority No. 1,\u201d said Ivan Fedorov, head of the Zaporizhzhia region. \u201cBut if we lose the new generation of our Ukrainians, for whom (do) we fight?\u201d",
      "Daria Oncheva, a 15-year-old student at Gymnasium 71, looks forward to the underground classes, and not just because she\u2019ll finally be in the same place as her schoolmates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s safer than sitting at home remotely,\u201d she said.",
      "School No. 88, across town, is further along, with rooms carved out and fully lined with concrete thick enough to block an initial onslaught of radiation. The contractor leading the project is also digging trenches for Ukraine\u2019s military. When done, it will also be the primary bomb shelter for the neighborhood, whose single-family homes tend to have small orchards and trellised gardens \u2014 but no basements.",
      "An optimistic timeline has the school ready for children by December. It has three layers of rebar totaling 400 tons of metal, plus 3,100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. The building will be topped by nearly a meter (yard) of earth, concealed by a soccer field and playground.",
      "The school will have an air filtration system, two distinct electrical lines and the ability to operate autonomously for three days, including with extra food and water supplies.",
      "Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who studies how people can survive nuclear fallout, said being underground improves survival by a factor of 10.",
      "But Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said ultimately people can do more \u2014 \u201cwhich is eliminating these weapons instead of \u2026 building, really not even a Band-Aid, for the actual problem.\u201d",
      "Lyudmila Zlatova, who has been the principal at School No. 88 for 30 years, hopes it will be a structure designed for the dangers Zaporizhzhia will face in the future. But she and the parents who gathered on a recent day were most concerned with the present, speaking at the edge of the construction pit as air raid sirens sounded.",
      "It takes 10 seconds for a bomb to reach the neighborhood from the front line, far too short a time to evacuate, and they land with unnerving frequency. The subterranean school\u2019s sunless rooms and concrete corridors will only make children more comfortable, given what they\u2019re already enduring, she said.",
      "\u201cThey will feel better studying without windows,\u201d Zlatova said, peering across at the construction site.",
      "Zlatova believes it will bring back at least some of the families who\u2019ve left Zaporizhzhia for other cities in Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe. The city remains fully functional, with public transit operating and grocery stores, markets and restaurants operating, and repairs ongoing for structures damaged by shelling \u2014 albeit in limited fashion. Around 150 of the school\u2019s 650 prewar students have left the city, but she said she\u2019s in touch with absent families and many promise to return home once there is a safe place to study.",
      "Gymnasium No. 6, which runs from first grade through high school, already has one. Its main building sits on the city\u2019s easternmost edge, closer than any other school to the front 40 kilometers (25 miles) away.",
      "Little wonder that its principal, Kostyantyn Lypskyi, seems a little frayed at the beginning of the academic year. But at least his students can attend because parents chipped in money last year to renovate the basement shelter about 50 meters from the main school building into a series of classrooms.",
      "His underground school, whose concrete walls and relatively thin metal doors are not radiation proof but protect against explosions, hold around 500 people \u2014 the same number as the new designs. The school has double that number, so students will alternate weeks. The youngest children study full-time just upstairs from the shelter, and the older ones are in the main building.",
      "\u201cOf course it will work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe prepared everything for the start of the new school year.\u201d",
      "In the earliest days of the school year, an air raid alarm meant he could test that confidence. It took five minutes from the moment the sirens sounded until the last children took their seats and spread out their books, awaiting instruction.",
      "It was morning, and they were ready for the day ahead.",

      "Online video production company MrBeast says it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire\u2019s workplace culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Online video production company MrBeast said Friday it has fired somewhere between 5 to 10 employees following an investigation into the YouTube empire's workplace culture.",
      "A company spokesman declined to put a precise number on the firings, say which employees were let go or for what reasons. But the shakeup comes as Jimmy Donaldson, who draws millions of views under the MrBeast alias with highly produced stunts and giveaways, deals with accusations of impropriety against himself, his collaborators and others within his multimillion-dollar production company that have threatened his family-friendly image.",
      "Investigators only identified \u201cseveral isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct,\" according to a two-page letter sent Friday by Alex Spiro, a trial lawyer who led the investigation by white-shoe law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and whose clients have included Jay-Z and Elon Musk.",
      "The nearly three-month probe concluded that there was no basis behind allegations that MrBeast team members committed sexual misconduct or \u201cknowingly\u201d employed people with \u201cproclivities or histories towards illegal or questionable legal conduct.\"",
      "Spiro said the team interviewed 39 current and former employees. Millions of documents from phones, emails, and messaging platforms including Discord and Slack were also reviewed, according to the letter.",
      "The controversies surrounding the so-called King of YouTube began snowballing this summer. Ava Tyson, a Donaldson friend and fellow creator accused of sharing inappropriate sexual messages with minors over multiple years, left the channel in July. Also circulated online by YouTuber Rosanna Pansino was a 2017 recording of Donaldson making racist comments and using homophobic slurs.",
      "A preliminary July shoot for his ambitious \u201cBeast Games\u201d Amazon Prime Video show was quickly hit with safety complaints from some contestants who said they faced \u201climited sustenance\u201d and \u201cinsufficient medical staffing\u201d while competing for a $5 million grand prize.",
      "MrBeast in turn has hired new executives, including a head of personnel and a general counsel, according to Spiro, and additional employees are getting \u201ctargeted training and executive coaching\u201d for undisclosed violations of company policy.",
      "The company \u201chas grown exceedingly quickly from a YouTube start-up comprised of a group of talented young individuals to a much larger entity,\u201d Spiro wrote to MrBeast's Board of Directors. \u201cIt is not uncommon that policies and practices essential in a mature company would lag behind commercial success.\u201d",
      "Donaldson has largely remained silent on the matters. He recently launched a prepacked lunch brand alongside internet personalities Logan Paul and KSI \u2014 marking his latest entrance into the food market after his chocolate bar and burger chain were met with mixed reviews. His 325 million YouTube subscribers have continued to see their feeds filled with outlandish, high-energy videos like the recently titled \u201c100 Identical Twins Fight For $250,000.\u201d",
      "In a Friday post on X sharing Spiro's letter, Donaldson wrote that he \u201cwas asked to refrain from making public statements to enable a detailed and unbiased investigation.\u201d",
      "Pansino, one of Donaldson\u2019s most vocal critics, responded on X that the findings of \u201cworkplace harassment and misconduct\u201d and \u201cmultiple firings\u201d mean \"it might be time for a bigger investigation.\u201d",
      "Donaldson's level of fame and growth place him in \u201cpretty rare company,\u201d said advertising lawyer Robert Freund, whose practice helps creators resolve disputes. He said he suspects the letter was released in attempt to assure stakeholders \u201cthat he's running a professional operation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anything fishy or suspicious about what we\u2019ve been presented with here as the public,\u201d Freund told The Associated Press.",

      "The amount of funding for the project is not yet set. But it's seen as one key way to help the country cope with soaring deliveries.",
      "A computer graphics video made by the government shows big, wheeled boxes moving along a three-lane corridor, also called an \u201cauto flow road,\u201d in the middle of a big highway. A trial system is due to start test runs in 2027 or early 2028, aiming for full operations by the mid-2030s.",
      "\u201cWe need to be innovative with the way we approach roads,\u201d said Yuri Endo, a senior deputy director overseeing the effort at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.",
      "Apart from making up for a shrinking labor force and the need to reduce workloads for drivers, the system also will help cut carbon emissions, she said.",
      "\u201cThe key concept of the auto flow-road is to create dedicated spaces within the road network for logistics, utilizing a 24-hour automated and unmanned transportation system,\u201d Endo said.",
      "The plan may sound like a solution that would only work in relatively low-crime, densely populated societies like Japan, not sprawling nations like the U.S. But similar ideas are being considered in Switzerland and Great Britain. The plan in Switzerland involves an underground pathway, while the one being planned in London will be a fully automated system running on low-cost linear motors.",
      "In Japan, loading will be automated, using forklifts, and coordinated with airports, railways and ports.",

      "Japan's shortage of truck drivers is worsening due to laws that took effect earlier this year that limit the amount of overtime drivers can log. That's seen as necessary to avoid overwork and accidents and to make the jobs tolerable, but in Japanese logistics, government and transportation circles, it\u2019s known as the \u201c2024 problem.\u201d",
      "Under current conditions, Japan's overall transport capacity will plunge by 34% by 2030, according to government estimates. The domestic transport capacity stands at about 4.3 billion metric tons, almost all, or more than 91%, by trucks, according to the Japan Trucking Association.",
      "That's a fraction of what's moving in a massive country like the U.S. About 5.2 trillion ton-miles of freight are transported in the United States each year, and that's projected to reach more than 8 trillion ton-miles of freight by 2050. A ton-mile measures the amount of freight shipped and how far it\u2019s moved, with the standard unit being one ton being moved one mile.",
      "Demand for deliveries from online shopping surged during the pandemic, with users jumping from about 40% of Japanese households to more than 60%, according to government data, even as the overall population keeps declining as the birth rate falls.",
      "As is true in most places, truck drivers have tough jobs requiring them to be on the road for days at a time, work that most jobseekers find unappealing.",
      "In recent years, annual fatalities from delivery trucks crashing on roads have hovered at about 1,000 deaths. That's improved from nearly 2,000 deaths in 2010, but the Trucking Association, which groups some 400 trucking businesses and organizations in the nation, would like to make deliveries even safer.",
      "The association is also urging consumers to hold back on delivery orders or at least bundle their orders. Some industry experts are urging businesses to limit free delivery offers.",
      "Trucks carry about 90% of Japan\u2019s cargo, and about 60% of Japan\u2019s fresh produce, like fruits and vegetables, come from distant places requiring trucking, according to Yuji Yano, a professor at the Ryutsu Keizai University, which is funded? by deliveries giant Nippon Express Co., now called NX Holdings, and focuses on economics and liberal arts studies, including trucking problems.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to clarify remarks he made at a New York campaign rally where he suggested that Republicans may try to repeal legislation that has spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Republicans \u201cprobably will\u201d try to repeal legislation that spurred U.S. production of semiconductor chips, a statement he quickly tried to walk back by saying he would like to instead \u201cstreamline\u201d it.",
      "Johnson made the initial comment while campaigning for a vulnerable New York GOP congressman in a district that is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant.",
      "A reporter asked Johnson whether he would try to repeal the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had disparaged last week. \u201cI expect that we probably will, but we haven\u2019t developed that part of the agenda yet,\" Johnson replied.",
      "Democrats quickly jumped on the Republican speaker\u2019s comments, warning that it showed how Johnson and Trump are pursuing an aggressive conservative agenda bent on dismantling even popular government programs. The White House has credited the CHIPS Act for spurring hundreds of billions of dollars of investments as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs. Vice President Kamala Harris has pointed to the legislation on the campaign trail as proof that Democrats can be entrusted with the U.S. economy.",
      "Johnson, who voted against the legislation, later said in a statement that the CHIPS Act, which poured $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, \u201cis not on the agenda for repeal.\"",
      "\u201cTo the contrary, there could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill\u2014to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements,\u201d the speaker's statement said.",
      "It wasn't the first recent comment Johnson has had to walk back. Earlier this week he had to clean up comments he made saying he wanted to \u201ctake a blow torch to the regulatory state\u201d and make \u201cmassive\u201d changes to the Affordable Care Act. After facing political blowback, he said that repealing the health care law was \u201cnot on the table.\u201d",
      "The incident was emblematic of Johnson's struggle working closely with Trump and at the same time campaigning for his House colleagues, especially those locked in tough reelection battles that are crucial to Republicans holding a narrow majority. The speaker was campaigning for Rep. Brandon Williams, a New York Republican who worked in the tech industry before running for Congress and supported the CHIPS Act.",
      "Williams said in a statement that he spoke privately with Johnson after he suggested that the act could be repealed.",
      "\u201cHe apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Williams' district is anticipating a large new Micron semiconductor manufacturing plant. The company has said it received grants of $6.1 billion from the CHIPS Act to support its plans.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday, \u201cAnyone threatening to repeal the CHIPS & Science Act is threatening more than 50,000 good-paying jobs in Upstate New York and $231 billion worth of economic growth nationwide.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hoping that the comments give them a late boost as they try to court working class voters in regions that depend on factory jobs. Harris, during a campaign stop in Saginaw, Michigan earlier this week, toured another semiconductor factory to bring attention to the 2022 law.",
      "In response to Johnson's comments Friday, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign, Ammar Moussa, said, \"Harris is running to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and make us competitive globally. The only way to guarantee these Republicans never get a chance to repeal these laws that are creating jobs and saving Americans money is to elect her president.\u201d",
      "As of August, the CHIPS and Science Act had provided $30 billion in support for 23 projects in 15 states that would add 115,000 manufacturing and construction jobs, according to the Commerce Department. That funding helped to draw in private capital and would enable the United States to produce 30% of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips, up from 0% when the Biden-Harris administration succeeded Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "Viet Shelton, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said, \u201cMost politicians usually go to a community promising to create jobs in the town they\u2019re visiting\u2026 Mike Johnson, ever the trendsetter, decided to visit a town and promise to kill jobs in that town.\u201d"

But Russian soldiers control another weapon they have never deployed, with the potential to be just as deadly: The nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.",
      "The NPP, as it\u2019s known, once produced more electricity than any other nuclear power plant in Europe. It fell to Russian forces in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion, and Russia has held its six reactors ever since. The plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides blame on the other.",
      "These twin dangers \u2013 bombs and radiation \u2013 shadow families in Zaporizhzhia. An Associated Press team spent nearly a week in the city to learn about its building binge for its future: an underground school system.",
      "Here's what AP found:",
      "About 50 kilometers (31 miles) away, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been in in cold shutdown for two years after intense negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Russian government. The IAEA has rotated a handful of staff on site ever since.",
      "There are risks even in cold shutdown, when the reactor is operating but not generating power. The main danger is that its external electrical supply, which comes from Ukrainian-controlled territory under constant Russian bombardment, will be cut off for a longer period than generators can handle.",
      "The nuclear plant needs electricity to keep crucial backups functioning, including water pumps that prevent meltdowns, radiation monitors and other essential safety systems. Russia has repeatedly struck at Ukraine\u2019s grid, attacks that have intensified this year. Highlighting the constant danger, electricity to the NPP was cut yet again for three days as emergency workers struggled to put out the fire.",
      "The Zaporizhzhia plant has a safer, more modern design than Chornobyl, known in Russian as Chernobyl, and there\u2019s not the same danger of a large-scale meltdown, experts say. But that doesn\u2019t reduce the risk to zero.",
      "Most of the youngest residents of the city have never seen the inside of a classroom. Schools that had suspended in-person classes during the COVID-19 pandemic nearly four years ago continued online classes after the war started in February 2022.",
      "Construction has begun on a dozen subterranean schools designed to be radiation- and bomb-proof and capable of educating 12,000 students.",
      "The cost to build a subterranean school system is enormous \u2014 the budget for the underground version of Gymnasium No. 71 alone stands at more than 112 million hryvnias ($2.7 million). International donors are covering most of it, and the national and local governments have made it a priority on par with funding the army.",
      "But most parents say bombs, which strike the city daily, are a far more tangible fear than radiation.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accuses Russia of targeting nuclear plants deliberately. Russian forces seized control of the Chornobyl area in the first days of the invasion, only to be driven back by Ukrainian forces.",
      "Since the start of the war, Russia has repeatedly alluded to its nuclear weapons stockpile without leveling direct threats. In September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider any attack by a country supported by a nuclear-armed nation to be a joint attack and stressed that Russia could respond with nuclear weapons to any attack that posed a \u201ccritical threat to our sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian officials fear that the Russian attacks on Chornobyl and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants may be just a start. During his speech in late September to the U.N. General Assembly, Zelenskyy warned that Russia was preparing strikes on more nuclear plants, which generate a large portion of Ukraine\u2019s electricity.",

      "The National Semiconductor Technology Center Extreme Ultraviolet Accelerator is scheduled to begin operating next year. The contract for it stems from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which was designed to create more high-tech jobs and help the United States compete with international rivals like China. The Biden administration has set a goal for the U.S. to make 20% of the world\u2019s advanced chips.",

With the introduction of Google\u2019s AI-powered Gemini technology, the maps are now being set up to become entertainment guides in addition to navigational tools.",
      "Starting this week in the U.S. only, users will be able to converse with Google Maps to ask for tips on things to do around specific spots in a neighborhood or city and receive lists of restaurants, bars and other nearby attractions that include reviews that have been compiled through the years. The new features will also provide more detailed information about parking options near a designated destination along with walking directions for a user to check after departing the car.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era of maps,\u201d Miriam Daniel, general manager of Google Maps, told reporters Wednesday during a preview of the features presented in Palo Alto, California. \u201cWe are transforming how you navigate and explore the world.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple snapped out of a recent iPhone sales slump during its summer quarter, an early sign that its recent efforts to revive demand for its marquee product with an infusion of artificial intelligence are paying off.",
      "Sales of the iPhone totaled $46.22 billion for the July-September period, a 6% increase from the same time last year, according to Apple\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter report released Thursday. That improvement reversed two consecutive year-over-year declines in the iPhone\u2019s quarterly sales.",
      "The iPhone boost helped Apple deliver total quarterly revenue and profit that exceeded the analyst projections that sway investors, excluding a one-time charge of $10.2 billion to account for a recent European Union court decision that lumped the Cupertino, California, company with a huge bill for back taxes.",
      "Apple earned $14.74 billion, or 97 cents per share, a 36% decrease from the same time last year. If not for the one-time tax hit, Apple said it would have earned $1.64 per share \u2014 topping the $1.60 per share predicted by analysts, according to FactSet Research. Revenue rose 6% from last year to $94.93 billion, about $400 million more than analysts forecast.",
      "But investors evidently were hoping for an even better quarter and appeared disappointed by an Apple forecast that implied its revenue for the October-December quarter covering the holiday shopping season might not grow as robustly as analysts envisioned. Apple's stock price shed about 2% in Thursday's extended trading, leaving the shares hovering around $221 \u2014 well below their peak of about $237 reached in mid-October.",

And those improvements are only available in the U.S. for now.",

The December expansion will include an option to connect with OpenAI's ChatGPT to take advantage of technology that Apple isn't making on its own. More languages",
      "Investors are betting that as Apple\u2019s AI becomes more broadly available, it will prompt the hundreds of millions of consumers who are using older iPhones to upgrade to newer models in order to get their hands on the latest technology.",
      "\u201cWe believe it's a compelling upgrade reason,\u201d Cook asserted. But Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro believes iPhone sales would already be accelerating at a faster pace if consumers were blown away by Apple's AI technology, increasing the pressure on the company \u201cto do an overall better job to impress the public.\u201d"

      "Will Trump have a (truly) unified government this time around?",
      "While control of the House is still up in the air, should it fall into the GOP column, Trump would begin his second presidency once again with a unified government behind him, and we'd get an immediate sense of how his approach to governance may have changed and how closely Republicans fall in line behind him. I think it's worth reminding ourselves that another Trump candidacy, let alone presidency, was far from a given at the end of his last term.",
      "Trump's first presidency was marked by some growing pains between his outsider, populist style and more establishment Republicans in Congress, particularly in the Senate. That caused some fits and starts in implementing an agenda \u2014 with Republicans sometimes seeming to govern in spite of Trump as much as with him or under his leadership. Even the end of his presidency was marked by Congress scrambling back into session to override his veto of a bipartisan defense policy bill on New Year's Day 2021.",
      "Check that date \u2014 it was just a few days before the Jan. 6 insurrection. After the events of Jan. 6, seven GOP senators voted to impeach the former president, and others \u2014 like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 at least flirted with it. While it wasn't a full-throated rebuke from the party on paper, it did feel like many Republicans in Congress were eager to close the door on Trump's chapter of the GOP. That was still the narrative after the party's underwhelming 2022 midterms, when Trump's endorsed candidates seemed to flounder. The party at that time seemed to be facing a choice about its future.",
      "Still, as soon as the 2024 Republican primaries started, it seemed that Republicans resigned themselves to making Trump their standard-bearer once again. Even as a presidential candidate, he held significant sway over the GOP agenda, like when he tanked a bipartisan border deal early this year. And as we heard hints of in his speech tonight, Trump is almost certainly going to take full credit for what looks to be a great election cycle for Republicans. His standing as party leader may translate better to Congress this time around, between his experience in the job and what looks to be a larger Senate GOP majority. After tonight, it feels like it's Trump's GOP, and we're all just living in it.",
      "Baldwin takes the lead in Wisconsin's Senate race",
      "Milwaukee County reported much of its remaining votes, most of which were absentee votes, and they went heavily enough for Democrats that Sen. Tammy Baldwin has taken a slender lead over Eric Hovde in the Senate race.

He also could use his familiarity with the federal bureaucracy to help install civil servants who are loyal to him.",
      "He will at least have a friendly, GOP-controlled Senate, though the House majority remains up in the air.",
      "Among the chief policy areas where Trump could leave his imprint are on the world stage, where he has forecasted less support for Ukraine; on trade, where he has boasted of tariffs of as high as 100% on some imports, and on immigration, where he supports a mass deportation force and eliminating the Temporary Protected Status program.",
      "He's also vowed to \"drill, baby, drill\" and lower costs, though his tariffs would likely raise the price of many goods, economists say, and he promised to eliminate tax on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits for seniors.",
      "Perhaps more than anything, though, Democrats will be on the lookout for any form of retribution from a candidate who repeatedly dubbed his detractors the \"enemy from within,\" though he never went after Hillary Clinton after leading chants of \"lock her up\" in 2016.",
      "Trump's victory this year was far from assured.",
      "Republicans across the spectrum panned Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol to stop certification of the 2020 election, with even allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., suggesting the party should move on from the former president and his brand. That nascent push was largely abandoned weeks later when then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., ventured down to Mar-a-Lago to make amends and discuss House strategy.",
      "Republicans' disappointing 2022 election results tore open those divides once again. After an anticipated red wave instead gave way to the loss of a Senate seat and only marginal House gains, GOP leaders wondered if the time had come to elevate other lawmakers as the party's future.",
      "Buzz mounted around Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as a younger Republican and culture warrior who could synthesize Trump's brawler style into more widespread appeal, with Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis calling him the party \"leader.\" Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence offered more traditional conservative credentials in a snapback of sorts to a pre-Trump party.",
      "Millions of dollars flooded a crowded 2024 GOP primary field, with DeSantis in particular leaning on a historically well-heeled and involved super PAC to proselytize his fighter credentials.",
      "None of it mattered.",
      "Pence dropped out before the calendar even turned to 2024. DeSantis ended his campaign before the New Hampshire primary after falling far short of expectations in Iowa. And while Haley stuck around for months, even drawing thousands of votes in primaries after she ended her own campaign in March, no candidate ever held a candle to Trump's share of the primary electorate.",
      "All of the 2024 contenders endorsed Trump except for Pence and former Govs. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and Chris Christie of New Jsersy, none of whom made close to a dent in the nominating contest.",
      "Even though he dominated he clinched the nomination as the GOP's dominant figure and former president, Trump's campaign was ultimately anything but conventional.",
      "Trump was dogged by a slate of investigations into his handling of classified documents upon leaving office, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016. He was able to fend off or delay many of the federal investigations he faced, and while he was convicted in a New York trial of 34 felony counts over the Daniels payments, his sentencing was delayed until after the election.",
      "Compounding on the history of the election were two assassination attempts against Trump, the first of which, in July, saw him grazed in the ear by a bullet.

      "Trump ended up with at least 279 electoral votes after clinching wins in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. Harris has won at least 219 votes. The race was marked by literal history, including two assassination attempts and 34 felony convictions against Trump, already having been impeached twice and faulted for mismanaging the COVID-19 pandemic response.",
      "Maybe even more memorable was President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the race after a ruinous June debate in which he struggled at times to form sentences.",
      "Trump's victory underscores just how deep voters' frustrations were surrounding inflation and immigration, Republicans' two top issues this election cycle as polls consistently showed Americans' unhappiness with how Biden handled them.",

      "For Trump personally, the win offers both political vindication and legal protection. Since his win, he and his brand were soundly rejected in 2018, 2020 and 2022.

    "summary": "How Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election.",
    "story": [
      "We'll have to wait for fuller data, but here are 3 possible reasons.",
      "Former President Donald Trump is projected to be the next president of the United States, according to an ABC News projection issued at 5:31 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday, Nov. 6. As of 6 a.m. Eastern, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had been projected for Trump, and the once-and-future president leads in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada as well. At this point, the most likely final outcome appears to be a 312-226 Trump victory. Plus, while it will take some time to count all the ballots, Trump looks likely to win the national popular vote for president, too.",
      "Over the next few months, we at 538 will do a lot of analysis to figure out how exactly Trump won. He may be, after all, only the second Republican presidential candidate since 1992 to win the national popular vote. That warrants not only introspection among Democrats, but a lot of quality analysis, too. And Trump's sweep of the swing states \u2014 while not surprising \u2014 also represents a new high-water mark for his electoral success.",
      "For now, though, here are three quick possible explanations for Trump's victory tonight. These insights draw primarily on the exit poll, which for various reasons is imperfect but for now remains the best source of available data on why and how different types of people voted. (We reserve the right to revisit these conclusions when more data is available.)",
      "Inflation",
      "For all the hubbub about various issues, statements, rallies and rhetoric during this election, the economy is unique as providing the most obvious gravitational pull toward Trump. Voters rank the cost of living in America as one of their top concerns \u2014 and no doubt it is one of the most pressing, salient and visible problems in their lives. It is not a stretch of the imagination to imagine they would punish the incumbent party for this regardless of how unfavorably they viewed Trump; in fact that is what voters have been doing all around the world over the past three years.",
      "According to the exit poll, 35 percent of voters nationally rated the \"state of democracy\" as the most important factor to their vote. Eighty-one percent of these people voted for Harris and just 17 percent for Trump. But the economy was the next-most-influential issue. Among these voters, Trump led 79 percent to 20 percent. In the end, abortion did not rate as highly as Democrats might have hoped; only 14 percent rated it as their biggest concern.",
      "It's possible that inflation contributed to the growing divide between high-income voters and low-income voters. According to the exit poll, Democrats increased their vote share by 9 points among voters living in households that make more than $100,000 dollars a year. Among households making less, which account for about 60 percent of voters, Republicans gained 12 points on margin.",
      "Racial polarization",
      "Initial exit poll estimates also suggest Democratic support declined among non-white voters and rose among white voters (especially college-educated ones). The exit poll indicates Trump won white voters by 12 percentage points, 55 percent to Harris's 43 percent. Compared to the 2020 exit poll, that is a 5-point improvement for Democrats.",
      "Democrats performed best relative to 2020 among white college-educated voters. They moved 7 points to the left, voting 54 percent to 44 percent for Harris. Non-white non-college-educated voters, meanwhile, moved 13 points toward Trump.",
      "The Republican's gains with nonwhites was particularly acute among Hispanic and Latino voters. Democrats' vote margin with the group fell by 26 points, according to the exit poll, to just a 53-percent-to-45-percent margin. Trump's vote share with Latinos looks like it could be the best since George W. Bush's 44 percent in 2004. Latino men moved 33 points toward Trump, one of his biggest swings.",
      "Democratic turnout was poor",
      "In addition to economic headwinds and deteriorating margins with their base, it looks like Democrats also simply had bad turnout. So far, around 137 million ballots have been counted for the 2024 presidential race. Predictions of final turnout are hovering somewhere in the neighborhood 152 million votes. That would be a decrease from the 158 million who voted in 2020 and would be equivalent to about 61 percent of eligible voters. That would be a decline from 66 percent in 2020.",
      "It is also likely that the drop in turnout disproportionately affected Democrats. While we can't be sure until we can review records of who actually voted (states will release those over the next few months), the drop-off in turnout is currently greater in the most Democratic counties across the battleground states. That is something that would uniquely hurt Harris; if you're a Democrat, then lower turnout in the suburbs is bad, of course, but not so bad as missing the mark in Philadelphia or Milwaukee, where you're relying on a lot of votes to carry you to victory.",
      "Over the next few months, we'll be able to pore over even more data about why Trump won (again). The basic explanation is that this was always going to be a hard election for Harris to win. She both failed to persuade swing voters and to get out her base where it mattered most. Democrats will have to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out how to recover.",

      "Here's what Trump has said he would do on Day 1:",
      "Be a dictator for the day",
      "Trump raised new alarms last year when he referred to himself as a \"dictator\" but only on \"Day 1\" during a town hall in Iowa.",
      "When asked by Fox News host Sean Hannity if he was promising that he \"would never abuse power as retribution against anybody,\" Trump responded, \"Except for Day 1.\"",
      "When asked what he meant by that, Trump said, \"I want to close the border and I want to drill, drill, drill.\"",
      "\"We're closing the border and we're drilling, drilling, drilling,\" Trump said. \"After that, I'm not a dictator.\"",
      "Fire the special counsel who indicted him",
      "If he returns to the White House, Trump has vowed to fire Jack Smith, the special counsel who has brought two federal cases against him, \"within two seconds.\"",
      "\"We got immunity at the Supreme Court. It's so easy. I would fire him within two seconds. He'll be one of the first things addressed,\" Trump said on a call into the \"Hugh Hewitt Show\" on Oct. 24.",
      "Trump has also said he would punish the prosecutors and judges overseeing his multiple criminal cases, as he's focused his third presidential campaign on retribution.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris has honed in on this during her campaign for president, saying at a rally this week that if elected, \"Trump on Day 1 would walk into that office with an enemies list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list, on behalf of you.\"",
      "Free some convicted Jan. 6 rioters",
      "Trump has said one of his first acts if elected to a second term would be to \"free\" some people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, whom he continues to claim are \"wrongfully imprisoned.\"",
      "\"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control,\" he said on his social media platform in March when announcing the promise.",
      "Trump has repeatedly downplayed the violence that ensued that day, referring to the defendants as \"J6 hostages,\" calling for their release.",
      "As of early October, more than 1,530 individuals have been charged criminally in federal court in connection with Jan. 6, with more than half pleading guilty, according to the Department of Justice. There were \"approximately 1,000\" assaults on police officers during the Jan. 6 riot, according to the DOJ.",
      "End 'Green New Deal atrocities'",
      "Trump said in a campaign video last year he would end the \"Green New Deal atrocities on Day 1\" if reelected.",
      "The Green New Deal -- a public policy initiative to address climate change pitched by Democrats Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey -- was never signed into law, though Trump has used the term to generally refer to the Biden administration's climate and energy policies, like the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"To further defeat inflation, my plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam. Greatest scam in history, probably,\" Trump said during remarks at the Economic Club of New York in September. \"[We will] rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.\"",
      "During a New Jersey rally in May, Trump promised to halt offshore wind energy projects \"on Day 1\" if elected.",
      "\"I'm going to write it out in an executive order. It's going to end on Day 1,\" Trump said, claiming that wind turbines \"kill\" whales, which was later denied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "He has also revived his \"drill, baby, drill\" slogan during this campaign.",
      "Trump has said his motivation behind withdrawing from climate initiatives and pushing for continued reliance on oil and gas is driven by economic needs.",
      "While taking steps toward a clean-energy future during President Joe Biden's tenure, the U.S. has continued to produce and export the most crude oil out of any country, at any time, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Mass deportations",
      "With immigration a top issue for voters, Trump has said he's determined to round up and deport millions of migrants living in the U.S. without legal permission. He reiterated a campaign promise to enact mass deportations on \"Day 1\" during his rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City last weekend.",
      "\"On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out,\" he said. \"I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, then kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible.\"",
      "To do so, the former president said he would use local law enforcement and the National Guard to find migrants living across the U.S.",
      "Trump has railed against the Biden administration's immigration policies, in part claiming they have made America less safe, though statistics show that U.S.-born citizens are more than twice as likely to be arrested for violent crimes than undocumented immigrants.",
      "An estimated 11 million people are living in this country without legal immigration status.",
      "If feasible, the cost to deport even 1 million undocumented immigrants a year would cost over $88 billion, for a total of $967.9 billion over more than 10 years, according to a new report from the American Immigration Council.",
      "Green cards for college graduates",
      "Trump deviated from his usual anti-immigrant rhetoric when he advocated for \"automatically\" giving noncitizens in the U.S. green cards when they graduate from college -- not just people who go through the vetting process -- during an episode of the \"All In\" podcast released in June.",
      "\"[What] I want to do, and what I will do, is you graduate from a college, I think you should get, automatically as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country. That includes junior colleges, too,\" Trump said in the episode, which was taped on Wednesday.",
      "\"Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years, if you graduate, or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country,\" he continued.",
      "Asked on the podcast if he would expand H-1B work visas for tech workers after fixing the border, Trump said \"yes.\"",
      "\"Somebody graduates at the top of the class, they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country. That is going to end on Day 1,\" Trump said.",
      "\"It's so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools,\" he added.",

      "LONDON -- More than 4,000 miles from home, small groups of Democratic and Republican voters in the British capital gathered within 2 miles of each other to witness what both sides have framed as one of -- if not the -- most important elections in American history.",
      "There are some 306,000 American voters in the U.K., according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, making them the second largest foreign voting block behind their 660,000 compatriots in Canada.",
      "Those who gathered in London on Tuesday were pitching vastly different visions crafted by wildly different directors.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris had vowed to give opponents \"a seat at my table,\" promising to bridge the widening divides fracturing American political culture. She decried former President Donald Trump as a \"fascist\" seeking \"unchecked power.\"",
      "Trump had threatened to set the military on what he called the \"enemy within,\" telling supporters they \"won't have a country anymore\" if he does not win back the White House. The former president still baselessly claims he won the 2020 election, and was hesitant to commit to accepting the results of Tuesday's vote if he lost again.",
      "The Democrats Abroad event in central London kicked off just before polls closed, when confidence was high among Democratic voters in the U.K. and elsewhere. The group booked its event location through until Wednesday morning, prepared for a long wait for a clear result.",
      "By the early hours of Wednesday morning, though, Trump had claimed victory as he neared the all-important 270 electoral college vote mark. Harris cancelled her planned address at Howard University in Washington, D.C., as supporters trickled away.",
      "Democrats Abroad U.K. Chair Kristin Wolfe was among those who were supremely confident in the final hours of voting.",
      "\"I feel like this is really going to be the night,\" she told ABC News. \"Not only are we going to turn a page on this old, stale rhetoric that has been coming out of the Trump camp for nine years, but we also get to look forward to something so optimistic.\"",
      "The ornamentation was assured. The event location -- the details of which were not published due to security concerns -- was decked out with red, white and blue bunting, hung around countless posters bearing Harris' campaign refrain, \"When we fight, we win.\"",
      "\"I'm trying not to get too excited,\" Harris supporter PK Whalen said. \"We've been disappointed before.\"",
      "One volunteer told ABC News they felt like \"a joyful warrior,\" and that they were \"completely and utterly convinced\" that Harris would win.",
      "Others were less sure, but still positive. \"I can either be worried or I can hope for the best,\" attendee Kshitij Kumar said.",
      "The organized Republican footprint in the U.K. is smaller. Unlike the Democrats Abroad UK group which is organized and funded by the Democratic Party, Republicans Overseas is not an official part of the GOP.",
      "Republican organizers like Greg Swenson always expect their team to place second within the U.K., given that Americans living in the country skew towards the demographic, educational and economic groups with which Democrats generally perform better. Some groups, though -- particularly the 10,000 or so military personnel in the U.K. -- do somewhat lean right.",
      "Swenson and a handful of colleagues planned to gather at a bar in central London on Tuesday to follow the results while juggling media appearances. A larger event was planned for Wednesday night. \"Hopefully it's a victory party,\" Swenson told ABC News.",
      "If not, Swenson said he hoped for a clear result and a graceful response from Trump. \"If Trump doesn't accept the results of the election, I don't think that's good news,\" he said, adding that the former president's baseless claims of electoral theft in 2020 were \"foolish\" from a campaign perspective.",
      "\"I would love it if Trump won by several points,\" Swenson said. \"And if Kamala wins, good for her. I hope it's by five points.\"",
      "Foreign policy generally does not move the needle significantly in U.S. presidential contests, though its importance may be somewhat elevated in 2024 with ongoing wars in eastern Europe in the Middle East in which U.S. forces are deeply involved -- and in some cases, directly threatened.",
      "Foreign policy will likely be a more pressing concern for Americans living outside of the country, as might be the thought that this week's election will cast the country in one of two very different international roles.",
      "Trump's message to the world, Swenson said, is that America remains \"the land of opportunity, and there's a reason people want to move here.\"",
      "\"We can be prosperous again -- that's better for the world and we can bring peace back,\" he added, though acknowledged Trump \"might exaggerate a little bit there.\"",
      "\"People might not miss Trump, but they miss peace and prosperity. And I think Americans living abroad are a little closer to it.\"",
      "The former president's embrace of controversial figures like Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Swenson said, suggests that the new Republican movement is one of \"future- and forward- looking people that aren't yesterday's news.\"",
      "For Trump's opponents, his election would mean a return to provocative nationalism, naked transactionalism and fawning praise of authoritarians.",
      "If Trump wins, \"It means we cannot give up,\" Wolfe said.",
      "\"But I don't think it's going to happen. I think that the American people know exactly what Donald Trump stands for, and they don't like it.\"",

      "Republicans unseated Democrats in West Virginia and Ohio.",
      "Republicans are projected to clinch control of the Senate after flipping at least two key states and successfully protecting their incumbents.",
      "Republican Gov. Jim Justice took the seat vacated by Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats. And businessman Bernie Moreno, the Ohio GOP Senate nominee, unseated three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, and Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz two lawmakers in red-leaning states who were Democrats' best pickoff opportunities, are also projected to win reelection, while Nebraska GOP Sen. Deb Fischer was projected to beat an independent challenger.",
      "With Democrats currently holding a 51-49 majority in the Senate, these wins will now at least deliver a 51-seat majority for Republicans, barring any upsets. Republicans also have a prime opportunity to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in deep-red Montana, though the results of that race have not yet been projected by ABC News.",
      "Maintaining control of the Senate was always going to be a daunting task for Democrats, who entered the 2024 election cycle with a brutal map.",
      "Democrats were defending seats in Montana and Ohio, two red states, as well as a slate of purple states, including Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The GOP-held seats in Florida and Texas were their best flip opportunities, though Democratic nominees there faced headwinds due to the lean of the states and former President Donald Trump's strength there.",
      "It remains to be seen precisely how big Republicans' margin will be -- none of the purple state races have yet been called. But Republicans were feeling bullish heading into the early morning hours Wednesday.",
      "\"Look, today starts a new wave. You know, we talked about wanting a red wave. I think what we have tonight is a red, white and blue wave in this country,\" Moreno proclaimed in his victory speech.",
      "While widely expected in Washington, Republicans' success marks a vindication of the GOP's strategy heading into the 2024 election cycle.",
      "Still smarting from a disappointing 2022 midterm cycle that saw Democrats defy the odds and expand their Senate majority by one seat, Republicans this time around were heavily involved in several Senate primaries, trying to elevate candidates they viewed as the most electable (they did not, notably, play in Ohio).",
      "On the other hand, the results are a severe disappointment for Democrats, who had appeared optimistic in the race's home stretch.",
      "Texas was online, they had insisted, and Florida remained attainable, if a reach. And independent Dan Osborn in Nebraska was giving Fischer a run for her money.",
      "Cruz and Scott ultimately coasted, and while Osborn did end up running a competitive race, he couldn't withstand the national headwinds in a state where Trump romped.",
      "The wins mark a return to power for a GOP that was locked out of Senate control for four years.",
      "Republicans lost the majority in early 2021 as a result of two painful Georgia Senate runoffs, losses that Republicans in Washington largely blamed Trump for after his repeated claims of election fraud in the state that caused distrust of the election system among Republicans in the state. And though the party was projected to perform well in the 2022 midterms, they instead lost a seat in Pennsylvania, taking Democrats' majority from 50-50 to 51-49.",
      "Republicans will seize the chamber at a time when longtime GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is stepping down from his role leading the conference (he'll still serve in the Senate). Republicans will take a vote next week to name a replacement, with the fight largely centered around South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Scott is also running, though he is viewed as a longshot.",
      "Should Trump win another term in the Oval Office, a Republican Senate will be key to approving judicial and administration nominees, though the 60-vote filibuster remains a potential obstacle in passing legislation, possibly forcing cooperation with Democrats on must-pass bills like on government funding and elevating the voices of Republican moderates like Sens. Susan Collins, Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, Alaska.",
      "\"Tonight Republicans retook the Senate Majority and held every single incumbent, which is great news for the American people. A Republican majority will work to secure the border, bring down prices, and help confirm President Trump\u2019s nominees. We still have a number of competitive races we are watching across the country that remain to be called,\" said Sen. Steve Daines, Mont., the chair of Senate Republicans' campaign arm.",
      "Democrats are likely to swiftly go on offense heading into the 2026 midterms, targeting seats in Maine and North Carolina, though they'll also have to play defense in Georgia and Michigan.",

      "Republicans are projected to have won control of the U.S. Senate after flipping several Democratic seats, and as the battle for the White House and the House of Representatives rages on, the GOP appears to be in a position to take control of not only Congress but also the presidency -- potentially putting former President Donald Trump on a glide path for policy approvals and Cabinet appointees should he win.",
      "With Senate control flipping from Democrats to Republicans, it could help boost the agenda of a possible Trump White House -- or block the priorities of a Kamala Harris presidency. Some of those priorities could be Cabinet appointees or potential Supreme Court justice confirmations. Federal judge confirmations could be either hampered or cleared depending on control, too.",
      "All 425 House seats are up for election -- and all eyes are on the key races that could potentially determine which party has control. Republicans currently control the lower chamber, but maintain a slim majority.",
      "Should the Senate, House and White House all go for the GOP, it will be the second time Trump has enjoyed such unity. Trump began his presidency in 2017 with a GOP-controlled House and Senate. Both former presidents Barack Obama in 2009 and Bill Clinton in 1993 also began their White House stints with Democratic control in both the House and Senate.",
      "Still, in the Trump, Obama and Clinton presidencies, at least one of the chambers flipped in the next election.",
      "While it may seem rare to have single-party control of the executive and legislative branches, it's not all that uncommon at the beginning of a president's first term, according to an analysis by Pew Research Center. It has been the case for 16 of 21 presidents dating back to Theodore Roosevelt -- though a few exceptions exist: Republicans George W. and George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon, Pew Research Center found in its analysis of data going back to the 56th Congress from 1899-1901.",

I look forward to working with President Trump and our new conservative majority to make America great again by making the Senate work again,\" Texas Sen. John Cornyn said in a statement.",

That is what we will set out to do on Day One. Our new Republican Senators will be instrumental in the success of this agenda.\"",

      "Broad economic discontent, sharp divisions about the nation's future and polarized views of the major-party candidates mark voter attitudes nationally in ABC News preliminary exit poll results of the 2024 election.",
      "Nationally, the share of people saying they've gotten worse off under the current administration (45%) is the highest in presidential exit polls that have asked the question -- even surpassing the 42% \"worse off\" in 2008, in the teeth of the Great Recession.",
      "The state of democracy narrowly prevailed as the most important issue to voters out of five tested in the exit poll.",
      "Preliminary results may change as exit polls are updated throughout election night and beyond.",
      "Voters broadly express more negative than positive views about the country's direction: Just 26% are enthusiastic or satisfied with the way things are going, versus 72% dissatisfied or angry.",
      "More voters see American democracy as threatened (73%) than secure (25%). Still, about 6 in 10 in these preliminary exit poll results say the country's best days are ahead of it, versus about a third who say the country's best days are in the past.",
      "Across the seven swing states, anywhere from 68% to 73% of voters think democracy in this country is threatened.",
      "Fifty-five percent call Trump's views \"too extreme,\" and he's underwater in personal favorability, 44%-55%. Fewer call Harris' views too extreme (46%), though she's also underwater in personal favorability, albeit slightly, 48%-50%.",
      "Trump, in the preliminary results, is slightly less apt in the seven swing states to be seen as \"too extreme\" than he is nationally, but still more so than Harris.",
      "Favorability isn't determinative: Just 40% saw Trump favorably in 2016, when he won the Electoral College (albeit not the popular vote). One reason is that almost as few, 43%, had a favorable view of his opponent that year, Hillary Clinton. (In 2020, Trump's favorability rating was 46%; Joe Biden's was 52%.)",
      "Underscoring the emotion associated with the contest, preliminarily 36% of voters say they'd be \"scared\" if Trump were elected, while 29% would be scared by a Harris win.",
      "In terms of personal attributes, voters in preliminary results pick having the ability to lead as tops among four that were tested in the exit poll.",
      "The economy remains a key irritant. Voters say it's in bad shape by 67%-32%. And 45% say their own financial situation is worse now than four years ago, versus 30% the same, with just 24% doing better. The \"worse off\" number exceeds its 2008 level, then 42%, and far outpaces its shares in 2020 (20%) and 2016 (28%).",
      "President Joe Biden takes the heat, with just a 41% job approval rating (58% disapprove). It's been a challenge for Harris to persuade voters she's taking a new direction from Biden's. (Biden's approval rating is the lowest for an incumbent president in exit polls since George W. Bush's 27% as he left office in 2008. Trump managed 50% job approval in 2020, yet Biden beat him anyway.)",

      "The state of democracy prevails narrowly as the most important issue to voters out of five tested in the exit polls. Thirty-five percent of voters ranked it as their top issue, followed by 31% who said the economy, 14% who said abortion, 11% who said immigration and 4% who said foreign policy.",
      "Abortion stands out in importance to women, at 19% in preliminary results, versus 8% among men, and rises to 42% among women younger than 30. (Women account for 53% of all voters, preliminarily; men, 47%.)",
      "Trump is more trusted than Harris on immigration and the economy in the preliminary exit polls while Harris leads Trump in trust on abortion.",
      "Sixty-six percent overall say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a central focus of Harris's campaign. (Support for legal abortion hit a low in exit polls, 51%, in 2020; its previous peak was 63% in 1992.)",
      "Legal abortion wins majority backing in all seven swing states from 60% to 69%.",
      "On immigration, a central focus for Trump, 39% say most undocumented immigrants should be deported, up from 26% in 2016 and 28% in 2012. Fifty-seven percent say undocumented immigrants instead should be offered a chance to apply for legal status.",
      "Georgia",
      "President Biden's 11,779-vote victory four years ago made him the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992. Post-election, a recorded call of Trump pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to \"find\" the votes Trump needed focused the nation on Georgia's election integrity.",
      "In preliminary exit poll results, 81% of Georgia voters say they're very or somewhat confident the state's elections are being conducted fairly and accurately, more than say so nationally (68%). These views are bipartisan, ranging from 94% of Democrats to 78% of independents and 72% of Republicans.",
      "Regardless, 68% of Georgia voters overall see U.S. democracy as somewhat or very threatened.",
      "Moreover, 42% of Trump voters in these preliminary results say that if he loses Georgia's official vote count, he should challenge the results rather than accept them. Half as many supporters of Kamala Harris say she should challenge a losing result, 21%.",
      "Forty percent of Georgia voters rate the economy as the most important issue in their vote, tops among five issues tested and more than the 31% who say so nationally. That's driven in part by the 52% who say they're worse off financially than four years ago, up considerably from just 16% in 2020 and surpassing a previous high of 33% in available exit polls since 1992. About three-quarters (73%) say the national economy is in not so good or poor shape, surpassing the 67% who say so nationally.",
      "Thirty percent of Georgia voters in these preliminary results are Black, on par with the share in 2020 (29%) and the most of any swing state. Georgia voters overall divide evenly between Harris and Trump in trust to handle racial issues, 50%-48%; 32% of white voters pick Harris on this question, rising to 89% of Black voters.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, voters are split on whether federal hurricane aid is going to the people who need it: 47% think it is, while 50% say it's not.",

      "North Carolina has voted Republican in all but two presidential elections since 1968 (2008 and 1976), including by 1.3 percentage points for Trump in 2020 (his narrowest victory that year). Biden improved on Hillary Clinton\u2019s results among college-educated white voters, moderates and men, making it a closer contest than in 2016, but Trump was bolstered by strong support from conservatives, evangelical white Christians and white voters without college degrees.",
      "Forty-seven percent in the state say they're worse off now than when Biden became president, the most in available North Carolina exit polls since 1992. Four years ago, fewer than half as many, 20%, said they'd gotten worse off under Trump.",
      "It follows that the economy is cited by 36% as the most important issue in their vote, although about as many, 32%, cite the state of democracy as their top issue. Among attributes, 32% cite \"the ability to lead\" as most important; 27% pick \"can bring needed change.\"",
      "Nearly 4 in 10 voters are conservative and 31% are white evangelical Christians, 9 points more than their share nationally, At the same time, 60% of North Carolina voters say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "Pennsylvania may be this year\u2019s tipping-point state. After voting for Trump by less than 1 percentage point in 2016, the aptly nicknamed Keystone State flipped to Biden in 2020, when he edged out Trump by just over 1 point -- or roughly 80,500 votes.",
      "Trump is underwater in personal favorability in preliminary exit poll results, with 47% expressing a favorable opinion of him overall, 51% unfavorable. (Still, that\u2019s slightly better than his ratings nationally, 44%-54% favorable-unfavorable.) Trump did even worse in favorability when he won the state in 2016 -- but benefited that year from an equally unpopular opponent in Hillary Clinton. In this year\u2019s preliminary results, Kamala Harris is equally as unpopular as Trump, 46%-53%, favorable-unfavorable.",
      "Issues can matter as much or more than personal ratings -- and 33% say the state of democracy is the most important issue in their vote for president, about even with the 35% who say so nationally. Thirty percent in Pennsylvania pick the economy as their top issue, again similar to the share who say so nationally (31 percent).",
      "In a liability for Harris, 50% of voters say their family\u2019s financial situation is worse today compared with four years ago, more than 45% who say so nationally and a high in available exit polls since 1992. Just 22% say their financial situation has gotten better.",
      "More voters favor than oppose the use of fracking in Pennsylvania, 55%-36%. Harris has said she won\u2019t ban fracking if elected; she\u2019s been criticized for reversing her position on the issue since her first presidential run.",
      "Michigan",
      "Trump\u2019s narrow victory in Michigan in 2016 marked the only time a Republican presidential candidate carried the state since 1988. Biden won it back by 3 points in 2020, improving on Hillary Clinton\u2019s results among independents, voters from union households and suburban voters. All three groups may be key again this year.",
      "Again, the democracy was the top issue for most voters, according to preliminary results: 35% of Michigan voters said the state of democracy mattered in deciding their votes. Fewer, 25%, said the economy.",
      "A plurality of Michigan voters (38%) say U.S. support for Israel is about right; the rest divide between saying it's too strong (29%) or not strong enough (27%). Michigan has the country\u2019s highest proportion of Arab Americans, a small but potentially important group from which Harris and Trump have vied for support.",
      "Arizona",
      "Arizona has voted for the Democratic candidate for president just twice since 1952: in 1996 and in 2020, when Biden won the state by 10,457 votes, his narrowest victory. One initiative is on the ballot that may draw voters especially concerned about abortion, as is another that may attract those favoring a crackdown on undocumented immigrants.",
      "Fifty-one percent of Arizona voters say they've gotten worse off financially under the Biden administration, more than the 45% who say so nationally and up dramatically from 15% in Arizona in 2020.",
      "Sixty-seven percent of Arizona voters in preliminary exit poll results say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from 53% in 2020 (and a slight increase from 62% in 2022). On the ballot this year is Proposition 139, which would add the right to an abortion to the Arizona state constitution.",
      "Fifty-five percent say most undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should be offered a chance to apply for legal status, while 41% say they should be deported to the countries they came from. This is similar to a 57%-39% result nationally. (This year\u2019s proposition would give state and local law enforcement the right to question, arrest, detain and prosecute anyone suspected of having crossed the border outside a legal port of entry.)",
      "Wisconsin",
      "Thirty-five percent of Wisconsin voters in preliminary exit poll results say the economy mattered most in their choice for president, slightly more than 31% nationally. Fifty-two percent say their family\u2019s financial situation has worsened in the past four years, surpassing the previous high of 35% in 2012 and more than 45% who say so nationally. Just 21% say their financial situation has improved.",
      "The state of the democracy virtually matches the economy as the top issue, with 33% saying it mattered most in their vote for president. A broad 72% of Wisconsin voters say democracy in the U.S. is threatened. At the same time, 80% are confident that elections in their state are being conducted fairly and accurately -- more than say so nationally, 68%.",
      "With the legality of abortion under dispute in the state, 17% of voters say abortion was the most important issue in their choice for president, ranking behind the economy and democracy as most important issues. Sixty-eight percent of Wisconsin voters think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up sharply from 54% in 2020.",

      "NEW YORK -- Bernard \u201cBernie\u201d Marcus, the co-founder of The Home Depot, a billionaire philanthropist, and a big Republican donor, has died. He was 95.",
      "Marcus died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by family, according to a Home Depot spokesperson.",
      "Marcus was Home Depot's CEO as it grew rapidly during its first two decades, and was chairman of the board until his retirement in 2002. Home Depot is now the world\u2019s largest home improvement chain. In recent years, he became an outspoken supporter of former President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWe owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHe was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He\u2019s left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture. \u201d",
      "The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Marcus was born in 1929 and grew up in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey, according to a biography on the company's website. Marcus had aspirations of becoming a doctor, but his family couldn't afford medical school and he endeavored to become a pharmacist, receiving a degree from Rutgers University. Marcus used to say he'd skip classes to sell Amana freezers door-to-door, according to Home Depot.",
      "After college, Marcus worked at the manufacturing conglomerate O\u2019Dell\u2019s and the retail chain Vornado, quickly ascending the corporate ladder. By 1972, Marcus was chairman and president of Handy Dan Improvement Centers, part of the Daylin conglomerate. It was there that Marcus formed a lifelong friendship with Arthur Blank.",
      "The big moment in his career arrived after he was fired by Handy Dan in 1978, along with Blank. Marcus had dreamt of a one-stop shop for do-it-yourselfers. At age 49, Marcus, along with Blank, founded Home Depot. Investment banker Ken Langone helped to secure financing to get The Home Depot started, according to the company.",
      "The first Home Depot opened in Atlanta the following year and by 1981, the company went public and began selling stock. There are now more than 2,000 Home Depot stores and the company employs more than 500,000 people. In the past decade annual sales at Home Depot have doubled, reaching nearly $153 billion in 2023",
      "Marcus has financially supported various charities as well as Jewish and medical organizations through donations. He also built the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, one of the largest in the world. The company said that his philanthropic work will continue through The Marcus Foundation, with a focus on Jewish causes, children, medical research, free enterprise and the community.",
      "Marcus was a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, donating nearly $5 million to the Republican Party between 2016 and 2020, according to OpenSecrets, an organization that tracks political spending. Last year, Marcus penned an op-ed for Real Clear Politics, a clearinghouse of elections data and analysis, that spelled out the reasons he was endorsing Trump for a second term."

      "A jury has found an Alabama man not guilty of killing an 11-year New Hampshire girl more than 35 years ago",
      "BOSTON -- A jury on Tuesday found an Alabama man not guilty of killing an 11-year New Hampshire girl more than 35 years ago.",
      "The case came down to whether the jury believed DNA found under Melissa Ann Tremblay\u2019s fingernails was from Marvin \u201cSkip\u201d McClendon Jr. After telling a judge Monday they were deadlocked, the jury returned Tuesday and found McClendon not guilty on the sixth day of deliberations.",
      "\u201cMr. McClendon was greatly relieved by the verdict,\u201d McClendon\u2019s lawyer, Henry Fasoldt, told The Associated Press, adding that he would return home to Alabama after being held for two-and-a-half years. \"We appreciate the jury\u2019s careful and thoughtful deliberations.\"",
      "Essex County District Attorney Paul F. Tucker said he \u201cdisappointed with the verdict\u201d but praised the efforts of prosecutors and law enforcement officers in the case.",
      "\u201cI recognize the work and dedication of the jury during their long deliberations in this case,\" Tucker said. \"My thoughts are with the family of Melissa Ann Tremblay, who have suffered greatly due to the crime that took her life.\u201d",
      "Last year, a judge declared a mistrial in McClendon\u2019s prosecution after a jury deadlock. The body of the Salem, New Hampshire, girl was found in a Lawrence, Massachusetts, trainyard on Sept. 12, 1988, a day after she was reported missing.",
      "The victim had accompanied her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend to a Lawrence social club not far from the railyard and went outside to play while the adults stayed inside, authorities said last year. She was reported missing later that night.",
      "The girl\u2019s mother, Janet Tremblay, died in 2015 at age 70, according to her obituary. But surviving relatives have been attending court to observe the latest trial.",
      "After initially ruling out several suspects, including two drug addicts, early on, authorities turned their attention to McClendon.",
      "He was arrested at his Alabama home in 2022 based in part on DNA evidence.",
      "Essex County Assistant District Attorney Jessica Strasnick told the jury that comments McClendon made during his arrest showed he knew details of the crime and that he was \u201cfixated on the fact that she was beaten, ladies and gentlemen, because he knew that she wasn\u2019t just stabbed that day, that was she was beaten.\u201d",
      "A left-handed person like McClendon stabbed Tremblay, Strasnick said. She told jurors that the carpenter and former Massachusetts corrections officer was familiar with Lawrence, having frequented bars and strip clubs in the city. He also lived less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) away at the time of the killing.",
      "Strasnick told the jury that the DNA evidence taken from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails excludes 99.8% of the male population.",
      "But Fasoldt said there was no proof the DNA came from under Tremblay\u2019s fingernails or was from McClendon.",
      "Fasoldt also said evidence shows that a right-handed person, rather than a left-handed person, could have stabbed Tremblay.",
      "He also argued that McClendon had \u201cno meaningful connection\u201d to Lawrence \u2014 other than that he lived 16 miles (25 kilometers) away in Chelmsford. He moved to Alabama in 2002 to a plot of land his family owned."

      "National Guard officials say more than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send Guard troops to Washington if requested in the weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration",
      "WASHINGTON -- More than two dozen states have indicated they would be willing to send National Guard troops to Washington if requested in the weeks following the presidential election and in the runup to the inauguration, Guard officials said Monday.",
      "The District of Columbia has not yet made any formal requests for Guard troops, but officials across the government have been preparing for the possibility that the U.S. Capitol could once again be rocked by violence around the certification of the election by Congress on Jan. 6 and the inauguration two weeks later.",
      "About 25,000 Guard troops from around the country flooded into Washington in the days after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot, when thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's win.",
      "The troops, along with local and federal law enforcement, locked down the city for the inauguration, securing the Capitol, monuments, Metro entrances and the perimeter of the central part of the city.",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Col. Jean Paul Laurenceau, chief of future operations for the National Guard Bureau, said it is not yet clear how many Guard troops will be needed or requested this year. He said it will depend on what the District of Columbia wants, but he noted that the National Guard Bureau and the states are leaning forward in anticipation of a request for assistance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to support D.C. with sustainment, lodging, transportation \u2014 anything they need to prepare for this mission,\u201d he said.",
      "Other officials have said it also will depend on intelligence reports assessing the potential threats to the city and the transition of power.",
      "Fueling concerns about possible violence are Trump's claims \u2014 without proof \u2014 that cheating is already underway in the election. At rally after rally, he has told supporters that the only way he can lose is if Democrats cheat, and he has repeatedly refused to say whether he will accept the results regardless of the outcome.",
      "Guard members have historically provided support for presidential inaugurations, going back to the one for President George Washington.",
      "But the 2021 event involved an enormous response due to the riot on Jan. 6, which forced lawmakers to flee the Capitol, delaying the certification of the presidential vote for hours. In the days afterward, Guard forces poured into the city by the busload.",
      "In 2021, a few states declined to send troops, also worried about violence within their own borders and capitals.",
      "Defense officials said Monday that 10 states have activated state Guard members to assist for the election \u2014 primarily doing cybersecurity missions. The total number of troops is about 125.",
      "In addition, nine states and the District of Columbia have put a total of about 120 Guard troops on standby, ready to deploy if needed on Tuesday or in the following days \u2014 also mostly for cyber missions and some security.",
      "Those states are Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. Officials said those numbers could change on Election Day as states reassess their needs."

      "Voters were deciding whether to send Republican Donald Trump back to the White House or elevate Vice President Kamala Harris to the Oval Office. With just hours until polls closed, tens of millions of Americans added their ballots to the 84 million cast early as they chose between two candidates with drastically different temperaments and visions for the country.",
      "Those casting Election Day ballots mostly encountered a smooth process, with isolated reports of hiccups that regularly happen, including long lines, technical issues and ballot printing errors.",
      "Harris stands to be the first female president if elected and has promised to work across the aisle to tackle economic worries and other issues without radically departing from the course set by President Joe Biden. Trump has vowed to replace thousands of federal workers with loyalists, impose sweeping tariffs on allies and foes alike, and stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Harris and Trump entered Election Day focused on seven swing states, five of them carried by Trump in 2016 before they flipped to Biden in 2020: the \u201cblue wall\u201d of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Arizona and Georgia. Nevada and North Carolina, which Democrats and Republicans respectively carried in the last two elections, also were closely contested.",
      "Trump voted in Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago club, and said afterward that he was feeling \u201cvery confident.\u201d",

      "After her DNC stop, Harris planned to attend a party at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington.",
      "Federal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation\u2019s election systems. They nonetheless were braced to contend with what they say is an unprecedented level of foreign disinformation \u2014 particularly from Russia and Iran \u2014 as well as the possibility of physical violence or cyberattacks.",
      "Both sides have armies of lawyers in anticipation of legal challenges on and after Election Day. And law enforcement agencies nationwide are on high alert for potential violence.",
      "Harris, 60, would be the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to serve as president. She also would be the first sitting vice president to win the White House in 36 years.",
      "A victory would cap a whirlwind campaign unlike any other in American history. Harris ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket less than four months ago after Biden, facing massive pressure from his party after a disastrous debate performance, ended his reelection bid.",

      "He survived one assassination attempt by millimeters at a July rally. Secret Service agents foiled a second attempt in September.",
      "A Trump victory would affirm that enough voters put aside warnings from many of Trump's former aides or instead prioritized concerns about Biden and Harris' stewardship of the economy or the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "It would all but ensure he avoids going to prison after being found guilty of his role in hiding hush-money payments to an adult film actress during his first run for president in 2016. His sentencing in that case could occur later this month. And upon taking office, Trump could end the federal investigation into his effort to overturn the 2020 election results.",

      "In September video game performers reached agreements with 80 individual games that have signed interim or tiered budget agreements with the performers\u2019 union and accepted the artificial intelligence provisions they have been seeking.",
      "The performers had been striking for over a month.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began striking in July after negotiations with game industry giants that began more than a year and a half ago came to a halt over AI protections.",
      "The interim agreement secures wage improvements, protections around \u201cexploitative uses\u201d of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances, as well as vocal stress. The tiered budget agreement aims to make working with union talent more feasible for independent game developers or smaller-budget projects while also providing performers the protections under the interim agreement.",
      "Thousands of hospitality union workers on the Las Vegas Strip reached a tentative deal with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts in August, a first for employees at the sprawling Italian-inspired complex that opened 25 years ago.",
      "The Culinary Workers Union announced on the social platform X that the deal came together after a year of negotiations. It covers over 4,000 hotel and casino workers, from housekeepers and cocktail servers to bartenders and porters.",
      "Bethany Khan, a union spokesperson, said the deal mirrors the major wins secured in recent contracts awarded to 40,000 hospitality workers at 18 Strip properties owned or operated by casino giants MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and Wynn Resorts.",
      "Those wins included a 32% pay increase over five years, housekeeping workload reductions and improved job security amid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence.",
      "The bump in pay under those contracts will amount to an average $35 hourly wage by the end of the contracts, according to the union. Workers at these properties were making about $26 hourly with benefits before winning their latest contracts in November.",
      "Unions representing 85,000 health care workers reached a tentative agreement with industry giant Kaiser Permanente in October 2023 following a strike over wages and staffing levels.",
      "The deal included setting minimum hourly wages at $25 in California, where most of Kaiser\u2019s facilities are located, and $23 in other states. Workers would also see a 21% wage increase over four years.",
      "The lead up to the tentative agreement included a three-day strike involving 75,000 workers in multiple states.",
      "The tentative agreement also included protective terms around subcontracting and outsourcing, as well as initiatives to invest in the current workforce and address a staffing crisis.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s actors voted to ratify a deal with studios in December 2023 that ended their strike after nearly four months, bringing an official finish to a labor strife that shook the entertainment industry for most of last year.",
      "Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists approved a three-year contract.",
      "Control over the use of artificial intelligence was the most hard-fought issue in the long, methodical negotiations. The contract called for a 7% general pay increase with further hikes coming in the second and third years of the deal.",
      "The agreement also included a hard-won provision that temporarily derailed talks: the creation of a fund to pay performers for future viewings of their work on streaming services, in addition to traditional residuals paid for the showing of movies or series.",
      "Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports returned to work in October after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have eventually caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.",
      "A walkout would have shut down as many as 36 ports that handle almost half of the nation\u2019s cargo from ships entering and exiting the nation. Any such strike would eventually have led to shortages that would have hurt the U.S. economy if the walkout by the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association went on for more than a month.",
      "The dispute is not over, however. Longshoremen suspended its strike after three days, but that lasts only until Jan. 15, providing more time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.",
      "Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points."

      "The Department of Justice says federal agents have arrested a Tennessee man who they say was trying to destroy a Nashville electrical substation",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Department of Justice said Monday that federal agents have arrested a Tennessee man with ties to white nationalist groups who they say attempted to use what he believed to be an explosive-laden drone to destroy a Nashville energy facility.",
      "According to court documents, Skyler Philippi, 24, is accused of planning to attach several pounds of C-4 explosives to an aerial drone with the intent of destroying an electric substation in Nashville.",
      "The newly unsealed court records reveal that Philippi in July allegedly told a confidential source who was working with the FBI that he wanted to attack several substations to \u201cshock the system.\u201d That confidential source later introduced Philippi to an undercover FBI employee, who began to collect information about Philippi's plan with other undercover agents.",
      "\u201cPhilippi researched previous attacks on electric substations and concluded that attacking with firearms would not be sufficient,\u201d wrote Angelo DeFeo, an FBI special agent, in the court records released Monday. \u201cPhilippi, therefore, planned to use a drone with explosives attached to it and to fly the drone into the substation.\u201d",
      "Philippi allegedly told undercover law enforcement officials that he was affiliated with several white nationalist and extremist groups, including the National Alliance, which calls for eradicating the Jewish people and other races. Such extremist groups increasingly have viewed attacking the United States' power grid as a means of disrupting the country.",
      "The U.S. grid includes more than 6,400 power plants and 450,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines that span the country.",
      "In September, Philippi provided the undercover officials with excerpts of his so-called manifesto, which focused heavily on preserving the white race.",
      "On Saturday, Philippi and undercover employees drove to his intended Nashville launch site and prepared to fly a drone that authorities say Philippi believed had 3 pounds of C-4 attached to it. The material had been provided by the undercover employees, according to court documents.",
      "Law enforcement agents arrested Philippi shortly after arriving at the site.",
      "\u201cAs charged, Skyler Philippi believed he was moments away from launching an attack on a Nashville energy facility to further his violent white supremacist ideology \u2013 but the FBI had already compromised his plot,\u201d Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement.",
      "A federal public defender was appointed to represent Philippi and a request for comment was sent to the attorney on Monday. Philippi is expected to appear in court on Nov. 13."

      "Court races are nonpartisan but candidates are nominated at party conventions. Democratic-backed justices currently hold a 4-3 edge, and Republicans have sought to flip it to regain a margin of control in a state dominated by Democrats for the past two years. They need to win both seats up for election to do so.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday as voters headed to the polls on the last day of the presidential election and as more data piled up showing the economy remains solid.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to pull closer to its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 427 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.4%.",
      "The market got a lift from a report showing growth accelerated last month for retailers, transportation companies and other businesses in the U.S. services industries. That was despite economists\u2019 expectations for a slowdown, and the Institute for Supply Management  said it was the strongest growth in more than two years.",
      "The report offered more hope that the U.S. economy will remain solid  and avoid a long-feared recession  following the worst inflation in generations.",
      "Excitement about the artificial-intelligence boom also helped lift the stock market, as it has for much of the last year. Software company Palantir Technologies jumped 23.5% after delivering bigger profit and revenue than analysts expected for the latest quarter. It\u2019s an industry known for thinking and talking big, and CEO Alexander Karp said, \u201cWe absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won\u2019t slow down.\u201d",
      "It helped offset a 5.2% drop for NXP Semiconductors. The Dutch company fell to one of the largest losses in the S&P 500 after warning that weakness it saw in the industrial and other markets during the latest quarter is spreading to Europe and the Americas.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 70.07 points to 5,782.76. The Dow gained 427.28 to 42,221.88, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 259.19 to 18,439.17.",
      "The market\u2019s main event Tuesday was the election, even if the result may not be known for days or weeks as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time.",
      "Despite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins  the White House, even if each party\u2019s policies can help and hurt different industries\u2019 profits.",
      "Since 1945, the S&P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation\u2019s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.",
      "The U.S. stock market has risen more in magnitude when Democrats have been president, in part because a loss under George W. Bush\u2019s term hurt the Republicans\u2019 average. Bush took over as the dot-com bubble was deflating and exited office when the 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession were devastating markets.",
      "Besides who will be president, other questions hanging over the market include whether the White House will be working with a unified Congress or one split by political parties, as well as whether the results will be contested.",
      "The general hope among investors is often for split control of the U.S. government because that\u2019s more likely to keep the status quo and avoid big changes that could drive the nation\u2019s debt much, much higher.",
      "As for a contested election, Wall Street has some precedent to look back to. In 2000, the S&P 500 dropped 5% in about five weeks after Election Day before Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush. That, though, also happened during the near-halving of the S&P 500 from March 2000 to October 2002 as the dot-com bubble deflated.",
      "Four years ago, the S&P 500 rose the day after polls closed, even though a winner wasn\u2019t yet clear. And it kept going higher after former President Donald Trump refused to concede  and challenged the results, which created plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.",
      "The S&P 500 ended up rising 69.6% from Election Day 2020 through Monday, following President Joe Biden\u2019s win. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation.",
      "In the four years before that, the S&P 500 rose 57.5% from Election Day 2016 through Election Day 2020, in part because of cuts to tax rates signed by Trump.",
      "Investors have already made moves in anticipation of a win by either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. But Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, suggests not getting caught up in such pre-election moves, or even those immediately after the polls close, \u201cwhich we believe will face inevitable tempering, if not outright reversals, either before or after Inauguration Day.\u201d",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury initially rallied following Tuesday morning\u2019s strong report on U.S services businesses but pared the gain later in the day. It slipped to 4.28% from 4.29% late Monday.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe and Asia. The moves were mostly modest outside of jumps of 2.3% in Shanghai and 2.1% in Hong Kong.",

      "Two other House races in the state\u2019s 4th and 6th districts, though less competitive, will also be closely watched as Democrats and Republicans battle for control of Congress. And in each contest, freshman female lawmakers are seeking reelection.",
      "Here are the tightest House races in the state:",
      "Republicans are looking to maintain a seat they flipped red during the 2022 midterms for the first time in roughly 25 years. But freshman U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer is facing a different Democratic opponent this November: Janelle Bynum, a state representative who has previously beat her in legislative elections in the district and is backed and funded by national Democrats.",
      "The seat is seen as a toss up by the Cook Political Report, meaning either party has a good chance of winning. Outside groups have poured millions of dollars into the race.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer narrowly won her seat in 2022 in the first election held in the district after its boundaries were significantly redrawn following the 2020 census. It now encompasses disparate regions spanning metro Portland and its wealthy and working-class suburbs, as well as rural agricultural and mountain communities and the fast-growing central Oregon city of Bend on the other side of the Cascade Range.",
      "Unaffiliated voters represent the largest constituency, although registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by about 25,000. Both parties are hoping that the higher voter turnout typically seen during presidential election years, compared to midterm elections, will energize their base.",
      "A small part of the district is in Multnomah County, where a ballot box just outside the county elections office in Portland was set on fire by an incendiary device about a week before the election, damaging three ballots. Authorities said that enough material from the incendiary device was recovered to show that the Portland fire was also connected to two other ballot drop box fires in neighboring Vancouver, Washington, one of which occurred on the same day and damaged hundreds of ballots.",
      "Oregon\u2019s newest congressional district, the 6th, is seen as a likely win for Democrats compared to the 5th, according to the Cook Political Report. This gives a slight advantage to incumbent U.S. Rep. Andrea Salinas, a Democrat who is running once again against Mike Erickson, a Republican she defeated in the 2022 midterms by roughly 2.5 percentage points.",
      "Salinas has far outraised Erickson, with over $5 million in campaign contributions compared to his roughly $545,000, the most recent federal campaign finance records show.",
      "Salinas and Chavez-DeRemer became the first Latina members of Congress to represent Oregon when they were elected in the 2022 midterms.",
      "Erickson is the founder and CEO of a shipping and logistics consulting company. It's his fourth time running for Congress.",
      "The boundaries of the 6th District were created during redistricting after the 2020 census. The district includes the state capital Salem and parts of Portland\u2019s affluent southwestern suburbs. And while it also spans rural areas across a broad swath of the Willamette Valley, President Joe Biden would have carried it by about 13 points in 2020.",
      "Democratic freshman U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle is seeking reelection in the 4th District, which spans the southern half of the state\u2019s coast and includes rural, mountainous communities and the more populous, liberal college towns of Eugene and Corvallis.",

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New Yorkers could play an outsized role Tuesday in determining control of the U.S. House as Republicans cling to suburban seats they won two years ago by seizing on fears of crime, and Democrats try to claw them back by warning that a right-wing Congress might ban abortion.",
      "If everything goes their way, Democrats hope to pick off a handful of Republican incumbents in congressional races on Long Island and in the Hudson River Valley, as well as a central New York district that state leaders recently reconfigured to make more favorable to Democrats.",
      "But the GOP could wind up holding all of that ground and has a chance of unseating one or two incumbent Democrats.",
      "Most of the tightest contests are happening in places where voters favored President Joe Biden over former President Donald Trump in 2020, but then sent a crop of Republicans to Congress two years later.",
      "The slew of competitive races underscore the hidden political complexity of New York, which is associated with Democrats like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez but has also given rise to Republican stars like U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, the chair of the House Republican Conference. All three were heavily favored to win reelection Tuesday.",
      "On Long Island, Republican U.S. Rep. Anthony D\u2019Esposito is in a tough rematch with Democrat Laura Gillen, a former town supervisor he defeated in 2022, but who might do better with Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket.",
      "In central New York, Republican Rep. Brandon Williams is trying to hold off a challenge from Democratic state Sen. John Mannion. Williams won his seat two years ago by a margin of only around 2,600 votes and this year his district was redrawn to exclude some rural areas where he had garnered support.",
      "In a trio of districts that include parts of the Hudson Valley, three incumbents \u2014 two freshman Republicans and a Democrat \u2014 are trying to hold on to seats they won by thin margins in the last election.",
      "On both sides, the strategy has been to play to moderate suburban voters while casting opponents as extremists.",
      "In 2022, Republicans in New York City's suburbs thrived with campaigns that portrayed the nearby city as having become lawless during the pandemic.",
      "Crime rates have dropped significantly since then, but Republicans have continued to press crime as an issue while also trying to capitalize on suburban unease about immigration policy and an influx of international migrants.",
      "Democrats have moved to mount a stronger defense to voters\u2019 concerns about crime and immigration. They have also hammered Republicans on abortion \u2014 a tactic that didn't produce anticipated wins for the party two years ago in a state where abortion rights are not generally seen as under threat.",
      "Republican gains on Long Island were eroded last year when former U.S. Rep. George Santos was expelled from Congress after he was revealed to have fabricated his life story and defrauded campaign donors.",
      "Santos was replaced in a special election by Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi, who is now running for reelection against Republican Mike LiPetri, a former state lawmaker.",
      "Further out on Long Island, Democrats have turned to former CNN anchor and author John Avlon in an effort to deny Republican U.S. Rep. Nick LaLota a second term.",
      "Three close contests are in districts that include parts of the Hudson Valley.",
      "In the suburbs north of New York City, Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler faces former U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones, a Democrat who previously represented part of the district before its boundaries were redrawn for the 2022 election.",
      "Jones, one of the first two openly gay Black men to serve in the House, portrayed Lawler as someone who \u201cmasquerades as a moderate on television but votes just like an extreme MAGA Republican.\u201d",
      "Lawler says Jones is the one masquerading as a centrist, when he is actually liberal.",
      "\u201cPeople want reasonableness,\u201d Lawler said in an interview before the election. \u201cThey want folks who are willing to work across the aisle to get things done.\u201d",
      "The race got extra attention in early October when The New York Times obtained a photo showing Lawler wearing blackface in 2006 at a college Halloween party where he dressed as Michael Jackson. Lawler said the outfit was intended to be an homage to a childhood idol.",
      "Elsewhere in the Hudson Valley, Democratic U.S. Rep. Pat Ryan is locked in a tight race with Republican Alison Esposito, who has served in the New York Police Department and is running on a law-and-order platform. Esposito, if victorious, would be the first openly gay Republican woman to serve in Congress.",
      "Further north, Republican U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro is trying to hold off Democrat Josh Riley in a district that sprawls from New York\u2019s border with Massachusetts across the Catskill Mountains and all the way to the Finger Lakes.",
      "The election is a rematch of 2022, when Molinaro narrowly defeated Riley. Molinaro has perhaps tacked harder to the right than his Republican colleagues in the state, most notably when he recently shared a social media post falsely claiming that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating house pets.",
      "In the one New York congressional race not involving an incumbent, Democrat George Latimer is heavily favored in a race against Republican Dr. Miriam Levitt Flisser. Latimer defeated U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman in a Democratic primary in June, the first member of the progressive band of liberals known as the \u201cSquad\u201d to lose a reelection bid."

      "Three-term incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana is facing perhaps his toughest reelection challenge yet",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- Three-term incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana faces perhaps his toughest reelection challenge yet on Tuesday, with control of the Senate on the line in a state that has veered sharply rightward since the 68-year-old grain farmer's first election.",
      "Republicans have pinned their hopes on Tim Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and founder of an aerial firefighting company. Sheehy, 38, had early backing from party leaders including former President Donald Trump, clearing the political newcomer's path to win the June primary.",
      "It is the first time Tester is sharing the same ballot as Trump, who twice won in Montana by wide margins.",
      "Long lines were seen at Montana polling places as a winter storm brought snow to some parts of the state.",
      "A Sheehy victory would seal Republican Party dominance across the five-state Northern Plains region: Tester entered office as one of six Democratic senators in the largely rural swath of American heartland that also includes Wyoming, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. He is now the only one.",
      "The lawmaker also is the sole remaining Democrat to hold statewide office in Montana.",
      "The candidates and their allies shattered political spending records and barraged voters with almost $300 million in ads on TV, radio, their phones and in their mailboxes. Total spending is expected to reach about $500 for each active registered voter in Montana.",
      "\u201cThis is the toughest race since Tester got in,\u201d said political analyst Jeremy Johnson, \u201cand Tim Sheehy is a real formidable candidate.\u201d",
      "In the race\u2019s final days, Tester\u2019s campaign plastered Montana newspapers and airwaves with advertisements amplifying claims from a former park ranger that Sheehy lied about a bullet wound in his arm.",
      "Sheehy said during an interview with conservative pundit Megyn Kelly that the wound came from combat in Afghanistan and wasn\u2019t accidentally self-inflicted as he told the ranger in 2015. The Republican said Tester was trying to smear him and other SEALs vouched for Sheehy\u2019s integrity, but he hasn't released any corroborating medical records.",
      "Montana's political profile has shifted dramatically since Tester's first election in 2006. It went from a \u201cpurple\u201d state that traditionally sent a mix of Democrats and Republicans to higher offices, to one where partisan divisions rule and the GOP enjoys a supermajority in the state Legislature.",
      "Tester warned throughout the campaign about \u201coutsiders\u201d such as Sheehy \u2014 who came to Montana in 2014 and bought a ranch \u2014 driving up housing prices and restricting hunting and fishing access for the general public.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of folks come into our state, rich folk, who want to try to buy our state, to try to change it into something that it\u2019s not,\u201d Tester said.",
      "Tester, the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, has built a record as a moderate over his 18 years in office. He has delivered legislation such as expanding health care for veterans and bringing broadband to rural areas, while sometimes opposing Democratic proposals to tighten rules for the energy industry.",
      "But Tester also consistently voted with Democrats on major legislation, putting him out of step with Montana's hardening conservatism.",
      "In the small city of Columbus, Montana, John Hungerford, 71, said after casting his ballot for Sheehy that Tester hadn't done enough to address his top issues \u2014 immigration and inflation \u2014 and too often followed the Democratic party line.",
      "\u201cHis voting record is not indicative of the values in Montana,\u201d Hungerford said.",
      "Sheehy sought to dent Tester's reputation for authenticity by highlighting more than $500,000 that lobbyists and their families donated to Tester this election cycle. Republicans alleged a pattern of campaign donations flowing to the Democrat from industries that needed his vote, after the lawmaker faced scrutiny over donations from bank executives affected by a 2018 regulatory roll back and from Lockheed Martin employees who benefited from a 2021 defense bill.",
      "There was no indication of wrongdoing by Tester. But Sheehy's tactic mirrored Tester\u2019s 2006 upset of a three-term Republican incumbent who was ensnared in a lobbying scandal.",
      "Sheehy also linked Tester to the perceived failures of the Biden-Harris administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got an economy that\u2019s on its knees. We\u2019ve got foreign policy crises all over the world that we can\u2019t even hope to begin to address right now. It\u2019s time for a change in leadership,\u201d Sheehy said.",
      "The Tester campaign's response was to remind voters of his longtime advocacy in Congress for Montana's economically vital agriculture industry.",
      "Tester also paired his campaign with efforts to pass a ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. It was part of an effort to court the independents and moderate Republicans whose support has kept Tester in office even as the state shifted rightward.",
      "Sandra Troy, 68, said abortion was at the top of her mind as she voted for Tester, believing the Democrat would help protect access to the procedure.",
      "\u201cThe government shouldn't be bossing into our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cTester, he votes for the people.\u201d",
      "Sheehy touted his military service and business experience, and drew parallels between his recent arrival in Montana and settlers in the early 1900s who were resented by those who arrived even earlier.",
      "Sheehy pushed past questions raised over his record as a lobbyist and derogatory comments he made to supporters about Native Americans.",
      "His campaign was buoyed over the summer by a rally with Trump in Bozeman, Montana. The fast-growing college city could be crucial in determining which side wins.",
      "Trump \u2014 who carries a personal grudge over Tester's 2018 derailing of Trump's veteran affairs nominee \u2014 mocked Tester's physical appearance during the event."

      "Election Day voting is unfolding largely smoothly across the nation _ with only scattered reports of delays from extreme weather, ballot printing errors and technical problems",
      "WASHINGTON -- After an election season marked by concerns over disinformation, foreign influence and worrisome threats to election workers and voting systems, Election Day unfolded relatively smoothly nationwide with only scattered disruptions and delays.",
      "Leading into Tuesday, more than 82 million Americans had already cast their ballots in a largely successful early voting period with high turnout despite some hiccups and frustrations in the presidential battleground of Pennsylvania.",
      "And when the final day of voting came, the problems that cropped up were \u201clargely expected routine and planned-for events,\u201d said Cait Conley, senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. She said the agency was not currently tracking any national, significant incidents impacting election security.",
      "Issues affecting voters on Tuesday included typical election mishaps, from a worker forgetting a key in Arizona's largest county to an election judge failing to show up at the polls in Pennsylvania's Allegheny County. Some precincts around the country faced issues with voter check-in processes and e-pollbooks, causing some delays for voters trying to cast ballots. Some areas had ballot printing mistakes and were printing new ballots and extending voting hours accordingly. Extreme weather across the midsection of the country also caused flooding and some other isolated problems, including knocking out power for at least one Missouri polling place that resorted to a generator to keep voting up and running.",
      "Still, in various states affected by rain, voters enthusiastically huddled under umbrellas as they lined up to cast their ballots, not deterred in a presidential election that many U.S. voters view as crucially important to the future of U.S. democracy.",
      "In the western part of the key swing state of Pennsylvania, a few counties saw reports of issues with tabulator machines that scan and count paper ballots filled out by voters. A Pennsylvania state judge ordered polls to remain open for two extra hours in Cambria County, which voted 68% for former President Donald Trump in 2020. The county sought the extension after a software malfunction affected the ballot-scanning machines, though county officials said no one was turned away from the polls and all ballots would be counted. It was yet to be seen how the extension might affect vote-counting timelines in the tight battleground.",
      "In Georgia, another presidential swing state, fewer than a dozen precincts were set to stay open late because of delayed openings or evacuations due to alleged bomb threats that were found to be non-credible, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. That included two precincts in Cobb County, which is northwest of Atlanta. They were staying open until 7:20 p.m. because they opened late due to equipment issues.",
      "The FBI on Tuesday afternoon said it was aware of multiple non-credible bomb threats to polling locations in several states and said many of them appeared to originate from Russian email domains.",
      "The massive early voting turnout before Tuesday \u2014 slightly more than half the total number of votes in the presidential election four years earlier \u2014 was driven partly by Republican voters, who cast early ballots at a higher rate than in recent previous elections after a campaign by Trump and the Republican National Committee to counter the Democrats' longstanding advantage in the early vote.",
      "The early voting period faced minimal problems, even in western North Carolina, which was hammered last month by Hurricane Helene. State and local election officials, benefiting from changes made by the Republican-controlled legislature, pulled off a herculean effort to ensure residents could cast their ballots as they dealt with power outages, lack of water and washed out roads. That appeared to continue on Tuesday, with the North Carolina Board of Elections reporting no voting issues.",
      "Besides the hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida, the most worrisome disruptions to the election season so far were arson attacks that damaged ballots in two drop boxes near the Oregon-Washington border. Authorities there were still searching for the person responsible.",
      "The absence of any significant, widespread problems has not stopped Trump, the Republican nominee, or the RNC, which is now under his sway, from making numerous claims of fraud or election interference during the early voting period, a possible prelude to challenges after Election Day.",
      "Trump on Tuesday suggested he wouldn't challenge the results of the election \u2014 as long as it's fair.",
      "\u201cIf it's a fair elections, I'd be the first one to acknowledge\u201d the results, Trump said, though what meets that definition wasn't clear.",
      "A late effort by Republicans to challenge Atlanta-area election offices' collection of mail ballots last weekend after early voting had ended was rejected as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d with Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge R. Stan Baker saying the GOP argument \u201cdoes not withstand even the most basic level of statutory review and reading comprehension.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, has urged voters not to fall for Trump's tactic of casting doubt on elections. She was spending Tuesday afternoon turning out her own vote at a phone bank hosted by the Democratic National Committee, and said phone banking represents \u201cthe best of who we are.\u201d",
      "This is the first presidential vote since Trump lost to Joe Biden four years ago and began various attempts to circumvent the outcome and remain in power. That climaxed with the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol to halt certification of the results after Trump told his supporters to \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Even now, a solid majority of Republicans believe Trump's lie that Biden was not legitimately elected, despite reviews, audits and recounts in the battleground states that all affirmed Biden's win.",
      "Through four years of election lies and voting-related conspiracy theories, local election officials have faced harassment and even death threats. That has prompted high turnover and led to heightened security for election offices and polling sites that includes panic buttons and bullet-proof glass.",
      "While there have been no major reports of any malicious cyberactivity affecting election offices, foreign actors have been active in using fake social media profiles and websites to drum up partisan vitriol and disinformation. In the final weeks, U.S. intelligence officials have attributed to Russia multiple fake videos alleging election fraud in presidential swing states.",
      "On the eve of Election Day, officials issued a joint statement with federal law enforcement agencies warning that Russia in particular was ramping up its influence operations, including in ways that could incite violence, and likely would continue those efforts well after the votes had been cast.",
      "Jen Easterly, the nation\u2019s top election security official, urged Americans to rely on state and local election officials for information about elections.",
      "\u201cThis is especially important as we are in an election cycle with an unprecedented amount of disinformation, including disinformation being aggressively peddled and amplified by our foreign adversaries at a greater scale than ever before,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot allow our foreign adversaries to have a vote in our democracy.\u201d",

      "Virginia Chau, a lawyer who worked as a polling center supervisor during elections, spoke in 2022 about threats made against election workers and the lack of training for them during a panel discussion on the short-lived streaming show \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart.\u201d",
      "Nationally, election officials have increased security in the lead-up to Election Day both to protect their workers and to protect voting procedures and ballots. Election offices and workers have been the target of harassment and threats since the 2020 presidential election, mainly by people supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen from him because of fraud.",
      "According to Chau's lawsuit, the Denver elections division director R. Todd Davidson told her she was being removed as a supervisor because of her comments on the show and said she could be a hotline representative instead because no one from the public would recognize her in that job. The move would have been a demotion, the lawsuit said, and Chau refused to accept the new position.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez did not respond to Chau's request to reconsider her termination.",
      "\u201cInstead of heeding Ms. Chau\u2019s call for more resources and training for election officials facing threats to their personal safety, Defendants decided instead to retaliate against one of their best, and most passionate, election workers,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit was filed against the city, its elections director and clerk and recorder. It asks for Chau to be reinstated and for unspecified damages.",
      "A spokesperson for Lopez's office, Mikayla Ortega, and a representative of the city attorney's office, Melissa Sisneros, said their offices do not comment on pending litigation."

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",
      "The first time he was asked, Trump avoided answering. He said instead of the issue that he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d That was a reference to the former president having appointed three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped overturn the landmark Roe v.

      "Former military defense contractor Leonard \u201cFat Leonard\u201d Francis has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Former military defense contractor Leonard \u201cFat Leonard\u201d Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers, federal prosecutors said.",
      "U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay $20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office. He was also ordered to forfeit $35 million in \u201cill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Prosecutors said the sentence resulted from Francis' first guilty plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation with the government since then and another guilty plea Tuesday for failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022.",
      "Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Francis cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled the country. He was later arrested in Venezuela and brought back to the U.S. in December 2023.",
      "Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 1/2 years for the bribery and fraud charges, plus 16 months for failing to appear. The sentences are to be served consecutively.",
      "\u201cLeonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,\" U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201dThe impact of his deceit and manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.\u201d",
      "Email and phone messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for William Douglas Sprague, an attorney for Francis.",
      "Sprague, who sought a sentence of just under nine years, argued that his client\u2019s cooperation should warrant a lesser sentence, 10 News San Diego reported.",
      "Sprague also said Francis' company provided the Navy with exemplary services for many years.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, as Leonard acknowledged in his early guilty plea and immediate cooperation, his greed drove him to commit bribery and to commit fraud,\u201d Sprague said.",
      "Prosecutors said Francis\u2019 actions led to one of the biggest bribery investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges.",
      "An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one time, Francis owned and operated his family\u2019s ship servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines.",
      "In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him classified information and even went so far as redirecting military vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship servicing company.",
      "In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015, admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He faced up to 25 years in prison.",
      "While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards.",
      "But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.",
      "He was arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance \u2014 caught before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia.",
      "The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in an effort to be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under scrutiny.",
      "The felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine each.",
      "Last year, Sammartino ruled that the lead federal prosecutor in the officers' case committed \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d by withholding information from defense lawyers, but that it was not enough to dismiss the case."

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"
