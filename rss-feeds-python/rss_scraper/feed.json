      "Top House Republicans are seeking documents and internal communications regarding President Joe Biden\u2019s statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Top House Republicans called on the White House to produce all documents and internal communications regarding President Joe Biden's statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump.",
      "White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden's statement, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.",
      "The lawmakers said they question whether the decision to create \u201ca false transcript and manipulate or alter the accurate transcript\u201d produced for the National Archives and Records Administration was a violation of federal law.",
      "Rep. James Comer, the Republican chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik demanded the White House produce the records. They're also calling for the White House to make available for a briefing the top supervisor of the White House Stenography's Office.",
      "\u201cThe White House cannot simply rewrite President Biden\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d Comer and Stefanik wrote. \u201c...We are concerned with the latest reporting of the White House\u2019s apparent political decision to protect the Biden-Harris Administration, instead of following longstanding and proper protocols.\u201d",
      "Biden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters \u2014 his \u2014 his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d",
      "The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading \u201csupporter\u2019s\u201d rather than \u201csupporters,\u201d which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president."

      "The debate over abortion rights is leading to expensive campaigns for state Supreme Courts in several states this year",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Abortion and reproductive rights have been central to the races for president and governor in North Carolina, a battleground state that has more moderate abortion restrictions than elsewhere across the South.",
      "That's been even truer in the fight for a seat on the state Supreme Court that abortion rights supporters say will play an important role in determining whether Republicans can enact even more restrictions. Registered Republicans currently hold five of seven seats and could expand that majority even further in Tuesday's election.",
      "Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat who is running for reelection, is focusing heavily on the issue and touts her support for reproductive rights. Her first television ad featured images of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, who prefers to restrict abortions earlier than the current 12 weeks. She says her GOP rival for the court could be a deciding vote on the bench for such restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that is landing in front of state Supreme Courts, and it is one that is very salient to voters now,\u201d Riggs said in an interview.",
      "Her Republican opponent, Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, said Riggs is saying too much about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an inappropriate manner, a clear violation of our judicial standards, our code of conduct,\u201d he said.",
      "The North Carolina race emphasizes how much abortion is fueling expensive campaigns for Supreme Courts in several states this year. Groups on the right and left are spending heavily to reshape courts that could play deciding roles in legal fights over abortion, reproductive rights, voting rights, redistricting and other hot-button issues for years to come.",
      "Experts say the campaigns show how the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning constitutional abortion protections that had been in place for half a century has transformed races for state high courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Dobbs did was made clear to both political stakeholders and the public that these state courts that hadn't got a lot of attention are actually going to be really important and they're going to be deciding some of the biggest cases that people might have expected to go to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",
      "Thirty-three states are holding elections for 82 Supreme Court seats this year. The 2024 election cycle follows record-breaking spending for judicial races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last year.",
      "Groups on the left have ramped up their spending on state courts considerably this year. The American Civil Liberties Union has spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "\u201cWe have never invested this heavily in state Supreme Courts before,\u201d said Katie Rodihan, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThis is really a groundbreaking move for us, and I expect this will be the norm for us moving forward.\u201d",
      "The targets include Ohio, where Republicans hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Democrats are defending two seats on the court, while a third is open, and Democratic victories in all three races are considered a longshot in the Republican-leaning state.",
      "Control of the court could be key if the state appeals a judge's ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's abortion restrictions. The ruling said the law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters last year that protected reproductive rights.",
      "Two seats are up for election on Michigan's court, where Democratic-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority. Court races are technically nonpartisan, but candidates are nominated at party conventions. Republicans would need to win both seats to flip the court in their favor.",
      "Justice Kyra Harris Bolden is defending the seat she was appointed to two years ago by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Bolden was the first Black woman to sit on Michigan\u2019s bench. She faces Republican-backed circuit court Judge Patrick O\u2019Grady for the remaining four years of the eight-year term.",
      "Republican state Rep. Andrew Fink is competing against University of Michigan law professor Kimberly Anne Thomas, who was nominated by Democrats, for the other open seat that is being vacated by a Republican-backed justice.",
      "Michigan voters already have locked abortion rights in the state constitution, though groups backing Bolden and Thomas are framing the races as crucial to defending those rights, with one group\u2019s ad warning that \u201cthe Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away.\u201d",
      "The most heated races are for two seats on the Montana Supreme Court, which has come under fire from GOP lawmakers over rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote.",
      "Former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch is running against county attorney Cory Swanson for chief justice, while state judge Katherine Bidegaray is running against state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups have been backing Lynch and Bidegaray. Both said in an ACLU questionnaire that they agreed with the reasoning and holding of a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to obtain a pre-viability abortion.",
      "Groups on the right have been painting them both as too liberal and echoing national Republicans' rhetoric, with text messages invoking the debate over transgender athletes on women's sports teams.",
      "The Republican State Leadership Committee, a longtime player in state court races, said its Judicial Fairness Initiative planned to spend seven figures in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "The group's ads are focusing on issues other than abortion. In one touting three Republicans running for Ohio's court, the group shows images of President Donald Trump along with images related to immigration.",
      "A super PAC backed by conservative donor and shipping executive Richard Uihlein also has given to groups involved in state Supreme Court races in Montana and Ohio.",
      "Progressive groups are even focusing attention on longshot states such as Texas, where Republicans hold all the seats on the Supreme Court. They're trying to unseat three GOP justices who were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state's abortion ban.",
      "One group, Find Out PAC, has been running digital ads in San Antonio, Dallas and Houston criticizing justices Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland. In its ad, the group accuses the three of \u201cplaying doctor from the bench.\u201d",
      "In North Carolina, Riggs' campaigning on abortion rights has prompted complaints from Republicans who say she's stepping outside the bounds of judicial ethics. But Riggs said she's not saying how she would rule in any case and is merely sharing her values with voters.",
      "\u201cI'm going to keep talking about my values because, at the core, our democracy works best when people cast informed votes,\u201d she said.",

      "Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d"

      "About a dozen cars await servicing in the shop as a dog Hooks adopted the day before barks in its new cage. Exercise equipment, motorcycles and power tools abut the kitchen on the side of the renovated building where his wife cooks a meal. At 6 feet, 2 inches, and with a sturdy build, Hooks has a graying beard and a head of curls he says could be laced with snow flurries by this time of year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to be one of the only Black businesses on this street,\u201d he says, noting that his repair shop stands on Peach Street, one of the city's main traffic arteries. He appreciates the greetings from passersby. But he says many people who know him from the neighborhoods where he grew up will never step foot in the shop. Almost all his customers are white.",
      "Hooks, 58, is a member of a coveted demographic in this year's election \u2014 a Black man and a business owner in a swing state. Both presidential campaigns have targeted Black entrepreneurs with their messaging, offering a range of economic policies and legislation that each side says will boost the careers and lives of African Americans.",
      "How Erie business owners and voters such as Hooks view each candidate's economic vision could determine control of the White House. Erie County has gone for the candidate who won Pennsylvania in every presidential election since 1992. Both Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris have visited the city of 94,000 in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cErie is a pivot point,\u201d said Rhonda Matthews, co-founder of Erie Black Wall Street, a business group that supports local Black entrepreneurs. From population rates to business startups, the future of Erie's economy and politics have shown where the country may be heading. \u201cI think if you want to know about what's happening economically writ large in the country, you can look and see what's happening in Erie.\"",
      "Harris has rolled out a series of economic proposals meant to tackle affordability and boost small businesses. Trump has stressed his promise of sweeping tariffs, new corporate tax cuts and an unprecedented crackdown on illegal and legal immigration to the country.",
      "Local leaders are weighing the impact of each agenda on their plans to renew the Rust Belt.",
      "\u201cA lack of predictability would be the worst possible thing,\u201d said Drew Whiting, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation, which is directing more than $100 million in private investment to the downtown area.",
      "Whiting praised federal policies such as Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are meant to spur economic development in low-income communities and were created as part of the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul, as well as the investments in Erie enabled by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law spearheaded by Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "But Whiting added that \u201cbroad brush\u201d policies such as Trump\u2019s proposed 20% tariffs on all foreign goods threatened to be \u201can inflation bomb that would crush small businesses\u201d like those he works with. Whiting viewed Harris\u2019 proposed investments for small businesses to be a potential boon. A no tax on tips policy, which both Harris and Trump favor, would be a welcome innovation for workers, he said.",
      "The Harris campaign has zeroed in on affordability as a key concern of voters amid rising inflation. Her proposals to punish companies that gouge prices and her promises to expand support for health care and child care are issues where the campaign believes they can lower costs for working families. Trump, by contrast, would lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, extend his tax cuts and further cut other individual and family taxes, including by eliminating taxes on Social Security.",
      "Most mainstream economists agree that Trump\u2019s proposals would worsen inflation.",
      "Local business owners who spoke with The Associated Press expressed cautious optimism about Harris\u2019 proposals to support small businesses, though most were largely skeptical about the impact that federal policy could have on their lives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so many factors, things to consider from right here and global factors,\u201d said Gus Paliouras, owner of New York Lunch, a local diner. Paliouras\u2019 family immigrated to the United States from Greece and bought the diner in 1970, when it was one of dozens of bustling businesses on top of a post office, school and church. Now Paliouras\u2019 diner is the only storefront left on the block.",
      "\u201cI try to keep it like Geneva in here,\u201d he said, referring to the city in famously neutral Switzerland. \u201cIn this town, we could have Trump, Kamala and Kennedy supporters sitting right next to each other at the bar.\u201d Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was in the race until August, when he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.",
      "Hooks considers himself a survivor.",
      "Born and raised in Erie, Hooks grew up in poverty and with few options, support or direction for his life. At 23, he was sentenced to 30 years for dealing marijuana. He served eight years in prison, an experience he described as \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d",
      "Prison was the first place Hooks was exposed to scripture \u2014 the Bible and Quran \u2014 as well as stories about travel, business and history.",
      "While he has transformed his circumstances and overcome \u201ctrials and tribulations that made me a better man,\u201d he finds the distinctions that some draw between poor, working and middle-class people to be meaningless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because we have people in this country that want to be better than someone else,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cYou drive a Toyota Camry, I drive the Lexus. It\u2019s the same ... car. It\u2019s just a different name, but it\u2019s a higher status.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor example, (Harris) says she wants to give us a $50,000 tax break or whatever,\u201d he added, referring to the vice president\u2019s proposed tax credit for new small businesses. \u201cBut that could never come into fruition with people that think they better than somebody, but you live next door to me, and your sign says Trump.\u201d",
      "In addition to his car care company, Hooks now runs a food catering business. On the weekends he goes back to the neighborhoods where he grew up to feed, clothe and cut hair for kids for free. His charity efforts are focused on making sure children never have the experiences he once faced.",
      "Hooks is skeptical of the ability of politicians to change fundamental problems facing everyday Americans, but says he\u2019ll be voting for Harris.",
      "\u201cTrump had the opportunity to be great,\u201d Hooks said, but called Trump's first term a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Hooks said he preferred \u201cgoing with someone who may at least try and help the little guy.\u201d"

      "Ameen Hurst, 20, shackled to a wooden chair, entered the plea Friday to 28 counts \u2014 including four counts of third-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder as well as escape, conspiracy and firearms crimes, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.",

      "The 2024 presidential contest speeds into its final weekend with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a razor-thin contest",
      "NEW YORK -- The 2024 presidential contest speeds into its final weekend with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a razor-thin contest.",
      "At this late stage in the campaign, every day matters. And while few voters might change their minds this late in a typical election, there is a sense that what happens in these final days could shift votes.",
      "Harris and Trump are crisscrossing the country to rally voters in the states that matter most. They're trying \u2014 with varying degrees of success \u2014 to stay focused on a clear and concise closing message. At the same time, each side is investing massive resources to drive up turnout for the final early voting period. And in these critical days, the flow of misinformation is intensifying.",
      "Here's what we're watching on the final weekend before Election Day, which is Tuesday:",
      "You only need to look at the candidates' schedules this weekend to know where this election will likely be decided.",
      "Note that schedules can and likely will change without warning. But on Saturday, Trump began with an appearance in North Carolina, with one eyebrow-raising stop in Virginia next, and planned to return to the Tar Heel state in the evening.",
      "No Democratic presidential candidate has carried North Carolina since Barack Obama in 2008, although it has been decided by less than 3 points in every election since. Trump's decision to spend Saturday there suggests Harris has a real opportunity in the state. But Trump is also trying to convey confidence by stopping in Virginia, a state that has been safely in the Democratic column since 2008.",
      "There is perhaps no more important swing state than Pennsylvania, where Trump is expected to campaign Sunday. But he also has another appearance scheduled for North Carolina in addition to Georgia, another Southern state that has leaned Republican for almost three decades \u2014 that is, until Joe Biden carried it by less than a half percentage point four years ago.",
      "Harris campaigned in Atlanta on Saturday before a rally in North Carolina's capital \u2014 signs that her team is sensing genuine opportunity in the South. She\u2019s planning to make multiple stops in Michigan on Sunday, shifting to a Democratic-leaning state in the \u201cblue wall\u201d where her allies believe she is vulnerable.",
      "Trump's campaign leadership wants voters to be focused on one key question as they prepare to cast ballots, and it's the same question he opens every rally with: Are you better off today than you were four years ago?",
      "Harris' team wants voters to be thinking about another: Do they trust Trump or Harris to put the nation's interests over their own?",
      "Whichever candidate can more effectively keep voters focused on their closing arguments in the coming days may ultimately win the presidency. Yet both candidates are off to a challenging start.",
      "Trump opens the weekend still facing the fallout from his recent New York City rally in which a comedian described Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating pile of garbage.\u201d Things got harder for Trump late Thursday after he raised the prospect of Republican rival Liz Cheney's death by gunfire.",
      "It was exactly the kind of inflammatory comment his allies want him to avoid at this critical moment.",
      "Harris' campaign, meanwhile, is still working to shift the conversation away from President Biden's comments earlier in the week that described Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage.\u201d The Associated Press reported late Thursday that White House press officials altered the official transcript of the call in question, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity.",
      "The spotlight of presidential politics always burns brightly. But it will burn brightest, perhaps, this final weekend, leaving the campaigns virtually no margin for error. In what both sides believe is a true tossup election, any final-hours missteps could prove decisive.",
      "Trump's graphic attack against Cheney was especially troublesome given his allies' heightened concerns about women voters.",
      "Polling shows a significant gender gap in the contest with Harris generally having a much better rating among women than Trump has. Part of that may be the result of the GOP's fight to restrict abortion rights, which has been disastrous for Trump's party. But Trump's divisive leadership has also pushed women away.",
      "Going into the weekend, Trump allies, including conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk, are warning that far more women than men appear to be casting early ballots. While it's impossible to know whom they're voting for, Kirk clearly believes that's bad news for Trump.",
      "Trump isn't helping his cause. A day before his violent rhetoric about Cheney, the former president made waves by insisting that he would protect women whether they \u201clike it or not.\u201d",
      "Harris, who would be the nation's first female president, said Trump doesn't understand women\u2019s rights \u201cto make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether the Democrat's argument can break through on this packed weekend. But Harris\u2019 team believes there's still a significant chunk of persuadable voters out there. And they say the undecideds are disproportionately Republican-leaning suburban women.",
      "More than 66 million people have already cast ballots in the 2024 election, which is more than one-third the total number who voted in 2020.",
      "They include significantly more Republicans compared with four years ago, largely because Trump has backed off his insistence that his supporters must cast ballots in person on Election Day.",
      "And while early in-person voting has ended in many states, there will be a huge push for final-hours early voting in at least three key states as the campaigns work to bank as many votes as possible before Election Day.",
      "That includes Michigan, where in-person early voting runs through Monday. Voters in Wisconsin can vote early in-person through Sunday, although it varies by location. And in North Carolina, voters have until 3 p.m. Saturday to cast early ballots in-person.",
      "The early voting period officially ended Friday in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.",
      "Meanwhile, questions remain about the Trump campaign\u2019s get-out-the-vote operation, which is relying heavily on well-funded outside groups with little experience \u2014 including one group funded largely by billionaire Elon Musk that\u2019s facing new questions about its practices.",
      "Harris\u2019 campaign, by contrast, is running a more traditional get-out-the-vote operation that features more than 2,500 paid staffers and 357 offices in battleground states alone.",
      "Trump's allies appear to be intensifying baseless claims about voter fraud, and some are being amplified by Trump himself. He has spent months sowing doubts about the integrity of the 2024 election in the event he loses \u2014 just as he did four years ago.",
      "His unfounded accusations are becoming more specific, in some cases, as wild claims begin to show up on social media.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump claimed on social media that York County, Pennsylvania had \u201creceived THOUSANDS of potentially FRAUDULENT Voter Registration Forms and Mail-In Ballot Applications from a third party group.\u201d He has also pointed to Lancaster County, which he claimed had been \u201ccaught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person. Really bad \u201cstuff.\u201d\u201d",
      "Trump was referring to investigations into potential fraud related to voter registration applications. The discovery and investigation into the applications provide evidence the system is working as it should.",
      "The Republican nominee has also raised baseless claims about overseas ballots and noncitizens voting, and suggested without evidence that Harris might have access to some kind of secret inside information about election results.",
      "Expect such claims to surge, especially on social media, in the coming days. And remember that a broad coalition of top government and industry officials, many of them Republicans, found that the 2020 election was the \u201cmost secure\u201d in American history.\"",

      "Even as Trump looks to expand the electoral map and project strength with trips to New Mexico and Virginia, two Democratic states not widely viewed as competitive, he is putting considerable time into North Carolina, which last backed a Democrat for president in 2008.",
      "The former president's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency gets significantly more complicated if he loses North Carolina. The fast-growing Southern state gave Trump his smallest margin of victory \u2014 1.3 percentage points \u2014 over Democrat Joe Biden four years ago.",
      "Trump campaigned in Gastonia, west of Charlotte, and Greensboro on Saturday, with a stop in Salem, Virginia, in between. He will be in the eastern city of Kinston on Sunday and in Raleigh on Monday. Those four rallies will bring his total events in North Carolina since Oct. 1 to nine. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been in the state six times during the same period, most recently on Friday.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, also was in North Carolina on Saturday for a concert and rally in Charlotte. Her campaign has not announced any other travel to the state before Election Day, though she's sending her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, to Greenville on Monday.",
      "The extensive damage from Hurricane Helene across western North Carolina has created a dose of uncertainty about the state of play here. Flooding destroyed homes and displaced residents in several counties, including the liberal city of Asheville and the conservative rural areas surrounding it.",
      "Trump's team has said it is confident about his chances in North Carolina. Democrats see Trump's attention on the state as a signal of optimism for Harris.",
      "\u201cThe repeat appearances may signal Trump\u2019s campaign is in trouble,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham. \u201cIf Trump continues with his dangerous, violent rhetoric these last few days, it may backfire. A campaign of personal retribution does not win votes from people.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump's late-campaign travels are not a signal of alarm.",
      "\u201cI'm not worried about anything,\" Miller told reporters Friday. \"We have a smart strategy that's going to get President Trump across 270, maybe even a couple of states that surprise you, that slide in there. But we\u2019re going to follow our strategy. Our strategy comes from our data and our targeting.\u201d",
      "As he does at most of his events in North Carolina, Trump said in Gastonia that his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he installed as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, is from the state, and that Lara and Eric Trump named their daughter Carolina.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing place. You\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d Trump said, alluding to the hurricane before repeating a debunked claim that the Federal Emergency Management Agency prioritized people living in the country illegally over hurricane victims. \u201cYour government has not helped you too much, I can tell you. Your government, FEMA, has let you down because they wanted to spend the money on illegal migrants instead.\u201d",
      "Later in Greensboro, only about half of the seats were filled in a massive 22,000-seat arena when Trump started speaking after 9 p.m. Trump spoke at another arena that\u2019s part of the same complex just 11 days earlier, though Harris filled the larger venue when she spoke there recently.",
      "Roughly half of North Carolina's 7.8 million registered voters had already voted as of Friday, buoyed by early in-person voting, which ended on Saturday afternoon.",
      "North Carolina Republicans have been encouraged by early voter turnout among their supporters after national and state GOP leaders switched this year to a \u201cbank your vote\u201d strategy, rather than focusing on Election Day turnout.",
      "Entering the final days of the campaign, over 50,000 more GOP registered voters than Democrats had voted early or by absentee ballot, even though there are over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans statewide, according to state elections data. It is unclear whether the Republicans' early vote surge will result in a higher overall turnout for Trump supporters.",
      "Independent voters now make up the largest group of registered voters in North Carolina. Trump lost ground with independents between 2016 and 2020.",
      "Harris took the stage in Charlotte after rocker Jon Bon Jovi warmed up the crowd, sticking closely to the speech she's been delivering in her final tour of the battleground states.",
      "Harris supporter Gwen Garnett, 66, said Trump barnstorming North Carolina is \u201cjust part of the process. It does not worry me at all.\u201d She gave Harris\u2019 candidacy a spiritual dimension.",
      "\u201cThis is an anointed time for her to be in this role,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cI just believe it\u2019s God\u2019s timing.\u201d",
      "The state\u2019s voters have shown a propensity to split their ticket over the years. That's why while Republicans have controlled the state legislature since 2011, Democrats have held the governor\u2019s mansion for all but four years since 1993.",
      "The GOP's hopes to break that hold on Tuesday appeared to dwindle in recent weeks after the party\u2019s nominee for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, received unwanted publicity from a CNN report that alleged he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website\u2019s message board more than a decade ago.",
      "While Robinson denied writing the messages and sued CNN for defamation last month, his campaign nearly imploded, raising fears that a large victory by Democrat Josh Stein, the state's attorney general, could harm GOP candidates in other races.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than $325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions.",
      "Berkshire said it sold off about 100 million more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The remaining stake of roughly 300 million shares was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth $174.3 billion.",
      "Investors will also be disappointed to learn that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares in the quarter.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said shareholders will wonder why Buffett is continuing to accumulate so much cash. \u201cAre they more pessimistic about the future economic and market picture than perhaps others are?\u201d she said.",
      "Buffett said at the annual meeting in May that part of why he started selling some of his Apple shares is that he expects tax rates to go higher in the future. But Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he wonders if part of the reason Buffett started selling Apple is tied to last year's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger because the sales started shortly after Munger's death. Shanahan said Buffett has never been as comfortable with technology businesses as his longtime partner was.",
      "\u201cIf Charlie Munger were still alive, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have sold down the position quite as aggressively \u2014 maybe at all,\u201d Shanahan said.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealized paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per Class A share.",
      "Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire\u2019s bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's $10.8 billion, or $7,437.15 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of $7,335.11 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at $92.995 billion. A year ago, it reported $93.21 billion revenue. That number was ahead of the $92.231 billion revenue that three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.",
      "Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses, including Geico, along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candy.",
      "One of Berkshire's insurers, Guard, reported some additional losses on previous years after managers reassessed its policies.",
      "Berkshire did resolve one mystery from the quarter by spelling out how much it paid to acquire the rest of the shares in its utility business from the estate of former Berkshire board member Walter Scott.",
      "Berkshire said it paid $2.4 billion cash, issued $600 million in debt and gave the Scott family Class B Berkshire shares worth a little over $1 billion. So the total compensation was about $4 billion. That means the Scott family didn\u2019t get nearly as good of a price for their 8% stake in the utilities as when Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel sold his 1% stake in the utility business two years ago for $870 million.",

      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a slimmed-down version earlier this year",
      "OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a sharply slimmed-down version earlier this year.",
      "Inslee urged permitting officials to work quickly to allow the construction of as many Horse Heaven Wind Farm turbines as possible, The Seattle Times reported. Washington state won't meet its \u201curgent clean energy needs\u201d if officials take years to authorize the turbines, he said.",
      "The original $1.7 billion project included up to 222 wind turbines across 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) of hillsides in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Washington and three solar arrays covering up to 8.5 square miles (22 square kilometers).",
      "But then Washington\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, a clearinghouse for permits required by large projects, recommended slashing the proposal in half because nests of the endangered ferruginous hawk were found in the area. It wanted a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) buffer around each nest.",
      "Most nests were empty, but the hawks can return to them years later.",
      "In May, Inslee rejected the council's recommendation to shrink the project, prompting the panel to suggest a compromise that would examine turbines and nests on a case-by-case basis. Under this plan, which Inslee formally approved Oct. 18, a technical advisory group would recommend whether to reduce individual nest setbacks to 1 kilometer (0.6 mile.)",
      "This could allow the developer, Boulder, Colorado-based Scout Clean Energy, to build all but 30 of the turbines originally proposed.",
      "Inslee, a Democrat, has sought to make climate initiatives key to his legacy. He is not seeking reelection after three terms in office.",
      "The wind farm project has pitted local opponents against the state\u2019s ever-growing need for renewable energy since it was first proposed in 2021. In a letter to the site evaluation council, Inslee noted that Washington\u2019s energy demands could nearly double by 2050."

      "Allen was the person seen on cellphone video German recorded on the day the girls disappeared and an unspent bullet found between their bodies came from Allen's gun, McLeland said.",
      "Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin told jurors Allen is innocent. Baldwin said the jury would hear witness statements and forensic evidence that would raise \u201creasonable doubt\u201d that Allen is not the killer and said the state's timeline does not match the evidence in the case.",
      "Someone else may have kidnapped the teens and returned them early the next day to the scene where they were found dead, Baldwin said.",
      "In the first full week of the trial, jurors were shown photographs of the area where the teens' bodies were found in a wooded area off the hiking trail. The girls, known as Abby and Libby, had crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge during their hike.",
      "Some jurors and others in the courtroom gasped or turned away when gruesome images of their bloody bodies were shown, and the girls' mothers wept.",
      "Jurors also viewed cellphone video that German recorded just before the youths vanished showing a man wearing a blue jacket and jeans following Williams as she crosses the Monon High Bridge.",
      "In an enhanced version of the video shown to jurors, one of the girls says, \u201cThere\u2019s no path so we have to go down here.\u201d Just before the video ends, prosecutors said, the man seen in the video tells the teens, \u201c Down the hill.\u201d",
      "Investigators said in an affidavit released about a month after Allen's October 2022 arrest that he became a suspect after they went back and reviewed \u201cprior tips\u201d and found that he had been interviewed by an officer in 2017.",
      "Trial testimony has revealed more details about how they zeroed in on the former pharmacy worker.",
      "A retired state government worker who volunteered in March 2017 to help police with the investigation told jurors that in September 2022 she found paperwork that caught her eye.",
      "Kathy Shank testified she found a \u201clead sheet\u201d saying that two days after German and Williams\u2019 bodies were found, a man contacted authorities and said he had been on the trail the afternoon the girls went missing. His name was listed incorrectly as Richard Allen Whiteman and marked \u201ccleared,\u201d Shank said.",
      "She determined the man\u2019s name was actually Richard Allen and recalled that a young girl had been on the trail at the same location and time and had seen a man.",
      "\u201cI thought there could be a correlation,\u201d Shank testified, adding that she notified officers of her find.",
      "The girls' bodies were found Feb. 14, 2017, the day after they went missing.",
      "Two days later, Allen contacted authorities and told them he was on the hiking trail the afternoon of Feb. 13, during the time period when the girls disappeared, according to testimony.",
      "Dan Dulin, an Indiana Department of Natural Resources captain, told the court he spoke to Allen, who said he was on the hiking trail between 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and remembered seeing three girls.",
      "After Shank brought Allen to investigators\u2019 attention, they interviewed him in October 2022. Allen told investigators he arrived at the trail around noon and left no later than 2 p.m., not 3:30 p.m. as he told Dulin in 2017.",
      "Steve Mullin, who was Delphi's police chief when the girls were killed and later became an investigator at the county prosecutor\u2019s office, said Allen told him and another officer that he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie on the day the teens vanished.",
      "Mullin said he asked Allen if he was the similarly dressed person seen in German\u2019s cellphone video.",
      "\u201cHis response was if the picture was taken with the girls\u2019 camera, there was no way it was him,\u201d Mullin testified.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors police interviews with Allen videotaped before his arrest in which he repeatedly professed his innocence.",
      "On Thursday the jury heard several recorded phone calls of Allen speaking with his wife from prison in which he told her that he killed German and Williams. In one of the calls, he said, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "The jury heard testimony earlier from the former warden of the Westville Correctional Facility, where Allen was previously held, who said Allen claimed to have killed the girls with a box cutter that he later discarded.",
      "Dr. Monica Wala, Allen\u2019s prison psychologist during his time at Westville, testified Allen began confessing to killing the girls in early 2023 during his sessions with her. She said he provided details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies.",
      "A report written by Wala and presented to the jury as an exhibit states Allen also told her he had planned to rape the teens but did not do so after he saw a van traveling nearby.",
      "A state trooper testified Thursday that Allen's remark corroborated a statement by a man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge and who said he was driving home in his van around that time.",
      "Allen's attorneys have said their client made the incriminating statements while under the pressure and mental stress of being locked up and watched 24 hours a day and being taunted by people incarcerated with him.",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged she followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while she was treating him and that she was a fan of the true crime genre.",
      "Court documents released weeks after Allen\u2019s arrest state that testing determined an unspent bullet found between the girls' bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d a pistol Allen owned.",
      "Melissa Oberg, an Indiana State Police firearms expert, told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s Sig Sauer, a .40-caliber handgun.",
      "Allen\u2019s attorney tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of firearms testing during cross-examination. Oberg said she is not aware of making any identification mistakes in her more than 17 years of analyzing firearms."

    "story": [
      "The FBI is investigating the death of a Black man in Alabama who was found hanging in an abandoned house",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The FBI is investigating the death of a Black man in Alabama, who was found hanging in an abandoned house, following a request from a local sheriff amid fears among community members who accuse local law enforcement of longstanding, unchecked misconduct.",
      "Sheriff's deputies found Dennoriss Richardson, 39, in September in a rural part of Colbert County, miles away from his home in Sheffield, a city of approximately 10,000 people near the Tennessee River.",
      "The Colbert County Sheriff's Office ruled Richardson\u2019s death a suicide. But Richardson\u2019s wife, Leigh Richardson, has said that is not true, explaining her husband did not leave a note and had no connection to the house where he was found.",
      "Instead, the 40-year-old fears her husband\u2019s death was related to a lawsuit he filed against the local police department in February. Dennoriss Richardson, who coached kids in baseball and football, had alleged he was assaulted, denied medical attention, sprayed with tear gas and shocked with a Taser while in jail.",
      "Leigh Richardson said she is not accusing a specific person but is adamant her husband didn't kill himself.",
      "She is not alone in her belief. Widespread skepticism about Richardson\u2019s death underscores deep-seated distrust of local law enforcement in Colbert County. In a region where hanging invokes a long history of state-sanctioned lynchings for Black people, residents in the county allege a pattern of excessive force among local law enforcement.",
      "Sheriff Eric Balentine, who confirmed the FBI accepted his request to investigate, said his department \u201cexhausted all resources\u201d in its investigation.",
      "\u201cWe feel confident in what our findings were, but we feel like by doing this we can give the family more peace of mind,\u201d Balentine said.",
      "A spokesperson for the FBI's field office in Birmingham confirmed the FBI is aware of Dennoriss Richardson's death and is reviewing the allegations of criminal misconduct.",
      "Tori Bailey, the president of the local NAACP chapter and the only Black member of the six-person county commission in Colbert County, said the community\u2019s reaction to Richardson's death was partially informed by the region\u2019s harrowing history with lynchings.",
      "In Alabama, there were 359 reported lynchings between 1877 and 1943, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform nonprofit. In Colbert County alone, there were 11.",
      "Bailey said, although there may be nothing to these accusations, it makes sense the community would have a \u201cvisceral\u201d reaction to a Black man hanging and want a more thorough investigation. She said while some officers are trying to do the right thing, in her 12 years as NAACP president she has documented and investigated many cases of excessive force in the county.",
      "\u201cThere has long been a kind of disconnect between communities of color and law enforcement. Unfortunately, many of us do not feel that law enforcement is actually there to serve and protect,\u201d Bailey said.",
      "Marvin Long, a 57-year-old Black man and lifelong Colbert County resident, knew Dennoriss Richardson\u2019s family well growing up. He shares the skepticism about the suicide ruling and said Richardson\u2019s death has intensified his fear of retaliation.",
      "\u201cTo this day I hate seeing a police car,\u201d Long said. \u201cI\u2019m still more afraid now than ever.\u201d",
      "Long sued the Sheffield Police department last year. After he inquired about an unrelated arrest taking place just outside his property in 2021, body camera footage appears to show officers following Long to his house, dragging him down his porch steps and siccing the police K9 on him as he screams for help. Long was unarmed, according to the complaint.",
      "Richardson and Long are among five Black and Latino men represented by civil rights attorney Roderick Van Daniel who have filed lawsuits against the department in recent years.",
      "\u201cCitizens are living in fear of retaliation,\u201d Van Daniel said.",
      "In one case, an off-duty Sheffield police officer was caught on surveillance footage punching and pulling a gun on a Black man at a liquor store. The officer was later convicted of assault and menacing and reckless endangerment. He was fired from the department.",
      "In a separate lawsuit, a 57-year-old chiropractor claims he was shocked with a Taser 18 times while in handcuffs after he asked an officer to help him find his wife\u2019s iPhone. Photos included in the suit show several large burn marks allegedly from the assault.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not respond to numerous phone calls and emails seeking comment. Lawyers for the officers named in pending lawsuits did not respond to emails.",
      "Balentine, the sheriff since 2023, declined to comment on specific cases. But he said that based on his almost 30 years as an officer in the area, he thought residents in Colbert County generally trusted law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s proven that it was excessive, then I\u2019m sure that there will be accountability,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Balentine said he hoped the FBI investigation would help assuage concerns.",
      "\u201cTransparency is always a good way to mend some fences with the community,\u201d he said.",
      "Leigh Richardson had known her husband since he was 17. She remembers Dennoriss, known affectionately as \u201cNa-Na,\u201d as a warm father to their five children. But she also said his fear of the police was not new.",
      "\u201cHe was scared at that young age,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "Richardson said that after filing the lawsuit her husband was frequently stopped by police. In those months, he was \u201ctrying to stay out of the way,\u201d she said.",
      "Sheffield Mayor Steve Stanley said Dennoriss Richardson had come to his office at least once to express concerns that he was being profiled. Stanley said he assured Richardson that any officers reported through official channels would be investigated.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not confirm whether or how frequently the department pulled over Richardson.",
      "Court records show Dennoriss Richardson had a long history of run-ins with local law enforcement, but the majority of the charges in federal and state courts did not stick.",
      "Dennoriss Richardson pleaded guilty to drug possession in 2006 and was sentenced to five years in prison. In more than 15 years since then, court records show Richardson was arrested at least six additional times by the Sheffield Police Department, for charges ranging from disorderly conduct to robbery to assault.",
      "None of those charges, except for a traffic violation for expired tags, resulted in a conviction, according to available court records.",
      "In the same week that Richardson filed his lawsuit against the department, he was charged with trafficking meth. He had been arrested in a house where drugs allegedly were found. Richardson was out on bond when he died.",
      "Stanley said he firmly supports holding officers accountable for misconduct but emphasized his overwhelming confidence in them.",
      "\u201cI have preached and believe that the majority of officers, at least, recognize that everybody deserves respect,\u201d Stanley said.",
      "Still, amid the looming investigation, uncertainty in the community prevails.",
      "In early October, Richardson\u2019s friends and family filled the pews of the small Trinity Memorial Funeral Home to commemorate his life. The singing and sermons were punctuated by calls for justice.",
      "At the pulpit, Van Daniel, Richardson\u2019s attorney, said Richardson \u201cbelieved in transparency and accountability. He stood up against police misconduct.\u201d",
      "There was a steady chorus of \u201camens\u201d from the crowd as Van Daniel spoke.",
      "\u201cHis family and the Sheffield community deserve answers,\" he said. \"We deserve answers.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- In 1989, Americans were riveted by the shotgun murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion by their own children. Lyle and Erik Menendez were sentenced to life in prison and lost all subsequent appeals. But today, more than three decades later, they unexpectedly have a chance of getting out.",
      "Not because of the workings of the legal system. Because of entertainment.",
      "After two recent documentaries and a scripted drama on the pair brought new attention to the 35-year-old case, the Los Angeles district attorney has recommended they be resentenced.",
      "The popularity and proliferation of true crime entertainment like Netflix\u2019s docudrama \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story\u201d is effecting real life changes for their subjects and in society more broadly. At their best, true crime podcasts, streaming series and social media content can help expose injustices and right wrongs.",
      "But because many of these products prioritize entertainment and profit, they also can have serious negative consequences.",
      "The use of true crime stories to sell a product has a long history in America, from the tabloid \u201cpenny press\u201d papers of the mid-1800s to television movies like 1984's \u201cThe Burning Bed.\" These days it's podcasts, bingeable Netflix series and even true crime TikToks. The fascination with the genre may be considered morbid by some, but it can be partially explained by the human desire to make sense of the world through stories.",
      "In the case of the Menendez brothers, Lyle, who was then 21, and Erik, then 18, have said they feared their parents were about to kill them to prevent the disclosure of the father\u2019s long-term sexual molestation of Erik. But at their trial, many of the sex abuse allegations were not allowed to be presented to the jury, and prosecutors contended they committed murder simply to get at their parents\u2019 money.",
      "For years, that's the story that many people who watched the saga from a distance accepted and talked about.",
      "The new dramas delve into the brothers' childhood, helping the public better understand the context of the crime and thus see the world as a less frightening place, says Adam Banner, a criminal defense attorney who writes a column on pop culture and the law for the American Bar Association\u2019s ABA Journal.",
      "\u201cNot only does that make us feel better intrinsically,\" Banner says, \u201cbut it also objectively gives us the ability to think, \u2018Well, now I can take this case and put it in a different bucket than another situation where I have no explanation and the only thing I can say is, \u2018This child just must be evil.'\u201d",
      "Much true crime of the past takes particularly shocking crimes and explores them in depth, generally with the assumption that those convicted of the crime were actually guilty and deserved to be punished.",
      "The success of the podcast \u201c Serial,\u201d which cast doubt on the murder conviction of Adnan Syed, has given birth to a newer genre that often assumes (and intends to prove) the opposite. The protagonists are innocent, or \u2014 as in the case of the Menendez brothers \u2014 guilty but sympathetic, and thus not deserving of their harsh sentences.",
      "\u201cThere is an old tradition of journalists picking apart criminal cases and showing that people are potentially innocent,\u201d says Maurice Chammah, a staff writer at The Marshall Project and author of \u201cLet the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think that the curve kind of goes up exponentially in the wake of \u2018Serial,\u2019 which was 2014 and obviously changed the entire landscape economically and culturally of podcasts,\" Chammah says. \"And then you have \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 come along a few years later and become a kind of behemoth example of that in docuseries.\u201d",
      "Roughly during the same time period, the innocence movement gained traction along with the Black Lives Matter movement and greater attention on police custody deaths. And in popular culture, both fiction and nonfiction, the trend is to mine a villainous character's backstory.",
      "\u201cAll these superheroes, supervillains, the movie \u2018Joker' \u2014 you\u2019re just inundated with this idea that people\u2019s bad behavior is shaped by trauma when they were younger,\u201d Chammah said.",
      "Banner often represents some of the least sympathetic defendants imaginable, including those accused of child sexual abuse. He says the effects of these cultural trends are real. Juries today are more likely to give his clients the benefit of the doubt and are more skeptical of police and prosecutors. But he also worries about the intense focus in current true crime on cases where things went wrong, which he says are the outliers.",
      "While the puzzle aspect of \u201cDid they get it right?\u201d might feed our curiosity, he says, we run the risk of sowing distrust in the entire criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take away the positive ramifications that putting that spotlight on a case can bring. But you also don\u2019t want to give off the impression that this is how our justice system works. That if we can get enough cameras and microphones on a case, then that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to save somebody off of death row or that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get a life sentence overturned.\u201d",
      "Adds Chammah: \"If you open up sentencing decisions and second looks and criminal justice policy to pop culture \u2014 in the sense of who gets a podcast made about them, who gets Kim Kardashian talking about them \u2014 the risk of extreme arbitrariness is really great. ... It feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before the wealthy family of some defendant basically funds a podcast that tries to make a viral case for their innocence.\u201d",
      "Whitney Phillips, who teaches a class on true crime and media ethics at the University of Oregon, says the popularity of the genre on social media adds another layer of complications, often encouraging active participation of viewer and listeners.",
      "\u201cBecause these are not trained detectives or people who have any actual subject area expertise in forensics or even criminal law, then there\u2019s this really common outcome of the wrong people being implicated or floated as suspects,\" she says. \"Also, the victims' families now are part of the discourse. They might be accused of this, that, or the other, or at the very least, you have your loved one's murder, violent death, being entertainment for millions of strangers.\u201d",
      "This sensibility has been both chronicled and lampooned in the streaming comedy-drama series \u201cOnly Murders in the Building,\u201d which follows three unlikely collaborators who live in a New York apartment building where a murder has taken place. The trio decide to make a true crime podcast while simultaneously trying to solve the case.",
      "Nothing about true crime is fundamentally unethical, Phillips says. \u201cIt\u2019s that the social media system \u2014 the attention economy \u2014 is not calibrated for ethics. It\u2019s calibrated for views, it\u2019s calibrated for engagement and it\u2019s calibrated for sensationalism.\"",
      "Many influencers are now vying for the \u201cmurder audience,\u201d Phillips says, with social media and more traditional media feeding off each other. True crime is now creeping into lifestyle content and even makeup tutorials.",
      "\u201cIt was sort of inevitable that you would see the collision of these two things and having these influencers literally just put on a face of makeup and then tell a very kind of \u2014 it\u2019s very informal, it\u2019s very dishy, it\u2019s often not particularly well researched,\" she says. \u201cThis is not investigative journalism.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- New York's mayor urged residents to take shorter showers, fix dripping faucets and otherwise conserve water, issuing a drought watch Saturday after a parched October here and in much of the United States.",
      "A drought watch is the first of three potential levels of water-saving directives, and Adams pitched it in a social media video as a step to try to ward off the possibility of a worse shortage in the United States' most populous city.",
      "\u201cMother Nature is in charge, and so we must make sure we adjust,\u201d said Adams, a Democrat.",
      "He ordered all city agencies to get ready to implement their water conservation plans. He asked the public to do its part by, for example, turning off taps while brushing teeth and sweeping sidewalks instead of hosing them down.",
      "The mayor also exhorted residents to report opened-up fire hydrants and other street leaks. The recommendation comes days after the city fixed a leaky Brooklyn hydrant that fed a homespun goldfish pond on the sidewalk.",

City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala said it was the driest October in over 150 years of records.",
      "Complicating the water squeeze, the city is repairing a big, leaky aqueduct that carries water from the Catskill region, so residents are relying more on reservoirs in the city's northern suburbs. That area got 0.81 inches (2 cm) of rain last month, about one-fifth the October average, the mayor's office said in a release Saturday.",
      "New York City uses an average of 1.1 billion gallons (4.2 billion liters) of water a day. That is about 35% below a 1979 peak. The city attributes the decrease to such factors as improvements in spotting leaks.",
      "Last month, nearly half the country was in a flash drought, which means a rapid dry-out from a combination of little precipitation and abnormally high temperatures. The Northeast capped the month with an unusually \u2014 one might even say weirdly \u2014 warm Halloween, with temperatures hitting the high 70s and low 80s (24 to 28 Celsius) from New York to Maine.",
      "Experts attributed the flash drought to a weather pattern that kept moisture from moving north from the Gulf of Mexico.",
      "The dry weather constrained shipping on the Mississippi River and contributed to wildfires in the Midwest and the East.",
      "The National Weather Service continued Saturday to warn of elevated fire risk in places including Connecticut, where a firefighter was killed last month while battling a dayslong brush blaze apparently sparked by a poorly doused campfire."

      "SCRANTON, Pa. -- President Joe Biden returned to his birthplace in Pennsylvania, making a final campaign stop Saturday for Vice President Kamala Harris and again let loose \u2014 offering the kind of unfiltered political sentiments that have become fairly common in recent weeks.",
      "Biden slammed Harris' rival, former Republican President Donald Trump, and his supporters on policy issues during a speech in Scranton, but then suggested that he'd hit back \u2014 literally \u2014 on faux \u201cmacho guys.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing Trump and his Republican friends want to do. They want to have a giant tax cut for the wealthy,\u201d Biden told the local chapter of the carpenters union. Then, apparently referencing people backing Trump, he added, \u201cNow, I know some of you guys are tempted to think it\u2019s macho guys.\u201d",
      "\u201cI tell you what, man, when I was in Scranton, we used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while,\" Biden continued. \u201cThese are the kind of guys you\u2019d like to smack in the ass.\u201d",
      "During a rally later Saturday night in North Carolina, Trump poked fun at Biden, asking the crowd, \u201cI don't even know, is he still around?\u201d",
      "Biden's comment in Scranton drew laughs from the crowd. But it was another moment of his veering off political script, something that's now happening frequently with the president \u2014 even though he has played a decidedly limited role in promoting Harris, making few campaign stops for his onetime running mate.",
      "Earlier this week, Biden sparked an uproar by responding to racist comments at a recent Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",

      "And the reference to \u201cgarbage\u201d followed Biden \u2014 during a recent stop at a campaign office in New Hampshire \u2014 saying of Trump, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to lock him up\u201d before quickly amending his comments to note he meant that Democrats need to \u201cpolitically lock him up.\u201d",
      "Biden\u2019s Saturday remarks come at a moment when gender issues and diverging partisan loyalties between men and women have emerged as a top feature of the campaign.",
      "Trump has pushed masculine tropes in a bid to garner more male voters throughout his campaign. He\u2019s supported a return to traditional gender roles and leaned into themes like \u201c protecting women \u201d whether they \u201clike it or not\u201d in the campaign\u2019s closing days.",
      "Harris has taken a far different approach, pledging to protect access to abortion and increase government spending to help families cover the costs of housing and childcare.",
      "Though he spent decades as a senator from Delaware, Biden spent his early childhood in Scranton and Saturday's event was a homecoming for the sidelined president in several ways. He spoke at the same union hall he visited on Election Day in 2020",
      "\u201cLet them know how important this election is,\u201d Biden told the crowd of about 200 enthusiastic supporters. When he noted, \u201cI\u2019m nothing special,\" one audience member shouted back, \"Sure you are,\u201d sparking chants of \u201cThank you, Joe.\u201d",
      "The president exhorted attendees to vote \u201cfor yourself and your families, people you grew up with, the people you come from.\u201d",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t forget where you come from,\u201d Biden thundered to shouts and applause. \u201cDon\u2019t leave behind the people you grew up with.\u201d",

They knew his mental health was fragile after more than one suicide attempt. But the best officers could do in a state with some of the most expansive gun rights is suggest Harris keep the weapon in a storage unit.",

And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college.

      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",

      "To interrupt transmission, at least 90% of all children need to be given a minimum of two doses.",

    "summary": "She dealt with grisly murder cases and then became the state attorney general - the Democratic candidate's California career offers clues about how she might govern.",
    "story": [
      "Just over three months ago, Vice-President Kamala Harris walked up to a microphone to make a speech that would define both her past and her future.",
      "A day before, President Joe Biden had dropped out of the election race and endorsed her to succeed him as Democratic candidate. With only a short period of campaigning ahead of her, Harris had no time to waste.",
      "There is a saying in politics: define yourself or be defined by your opponent. And in that moment, when Harris made her first pitch to the American people, she defined herself not just in terms of her record in the White House or as a US senator, but the years she spent as a California prosecutor.",
      "\u201cI took on perpetrators of all kinds - predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type,\u201d she said of her Republican challenger.",
      "The line has been repeated often at her campaign rallies and stump speeches, as the 60-year-old has sought to frame this election as a contest between a hard-bitten prosecutor and a convicted felon, constantly reminding voters of Trump\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "But a look back at Harris\u2019s time in and out of California's courtrooms reveals her enduring struggle to define herself, what her opponents say is a history of pivoting on issues depending on the political weather, as well as her uncanny ability to seize the moment when others have counted her out.",
      "Street murders and rough San Francisco politics",
      "Harris\u2019s time in law enforcement began just out of law school in Alameda County, California - which includes the cities of Berkeley and her hometown of Oakland.",
      "During the 1990s, in the midst of the government's \"war on drugs\", Oakland struggled with violent crime.",
      "For a junior prosecutor, the job was daunting. But the severity of the cases you had to deal with meant it was considered a top job for a young and ambitious attorney, said Teresa Drenick, who worked with Harris at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was like a potboiler of an atmosphere. The amount of grief and agony you ingested every day was hard to process. For us, it was intense. The stakes being high, the crimes being so serious,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "\"It was near the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic. There were gang murders, street corner murders taking place. There was a lot going on in Oakland that enabled you as a prosecutor to handle some of the most serious cases that a prosecutor is ever going to handle.\"",
      "Ms Drenick and Harris were on the same trial team together. She admired Harris\u2019s confidence in front of a jury, and her respect for her colleague only grew when Harris was transferred to a different team in the same courthouse focused on child sexual assault.",
      "\"She was very, very caring of victims of child abuse. She was able to speak to them in a way that allowed them to open up to her,\u201d she said.",
      "It was at this time that Harris dated Willie Brown, a local political kingmaker and speaker of the California State Assembly who helped launch the careers of some of the state\u2019s other most prominent political leaders, including Gavin Newsom, the current governor, and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.",
      "Brown appointed her to two state boards and introduced her to some of San Francisco\u2019s highest-profile Democratic donors. The short-lived romance ended by the time Brown was elected as the city\u2019s mayor in 1995. Three years later, Harris took a job at the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "During her relationship with Brown, who was 30 years her senior, Harris had begun mingling with some of the city\u2019s political heavyweights.",
      "San Francisco's political machine, which Harris has described as \u201ca bare-knuckled sport\u201d, has launched the careers of some of the nation\u2019s biggest political stalwarts including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.",
      "Harris forged relationships with both of them, rising alongside contemporaries like Newsom, as she found her feet in the political world.",
      "Her swift rise through San Francisco\u2019s rough-and-tumble politics were defined by days in courtrooms representing victims and nights at glitzy political galas.",
      "This was also around the time that Harris met one of her closest friends \u2013 and most significant donors - Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.",
      "Jobs donated $500 to Harris\u2019s 2003 campaign for San Francisco district attorney, which she won, toppling the man who had hired her. Twenty years later, the billionaire philanthropist donated nearly $1m to the Biden-Harris re-election campaign, according to Fortune Magazine. It\u2019s not known how much she has directly contributed to Harris\u2019s bid for the presidency, but the amount is considered substantial.",
      "\u2018No exception to principle\u2019",
      "On the day before Easter in 2004, just four months into Kamala Harris\u2019s tenure as the district attorney of San Francisco, a gang member brandishing an AK-47 rifle fatally shot a 29-year old police officer named Isaac Espinoza.",
      "The slaying stunned the city, with many politicians and prominent members of the police calling for the death penalty.",
      "But Harris, who had made opposition to capital punishment a key part of her political campaign to become the city\u2019s top prosecutor, instead decided to pursue a life sentence without parole. She made her decision public just 48 hours after the murder, without informing the widow first.",
      "\u201cShe did not call me,\u201d Espinoza told CNN in 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It\u2019s like, you can\u2019t even wait till he\u2019s buried?\u201d",
      "The backlash was swift. Speaking at the officer\u2019s funeral, Senator Feinstein demanded his killer \u201cpay the ultimate price\u201d. While walking out of the church service, she told reporters that had she known Harris was against the death penalty, she probably wouldn't have endorsed her.",
      "\u201c[T]here can be no exception to principle,\u201d Harris later wrote in an opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle, defending her decision.",
      "Long-time civil rights attorney John Burris, who supported Harris\u2019s decision at the time, said he thought it was \u201cpolitically was not wise for her, but it was a philosophical position she took\u201d.",
      "\"She was pretty bold in her position and she did take a lot of heat for it,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThat was a pretty progressive stand.\u201d",
      "The incident could have been the end of her political ambitions, but Harris, who had grown up with a single mother in the working-class city of Oakland, carried on.",
      "\u201cIs she a political animal? Absolutely not. Is she naturally skilled? Yes,\u201d said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris\u2019s two successful campaigns for California attorney general in 2010 and 2014. \u201cFor her, politics is the means to the end. She is focused on the end result and the impact she can have on people\u2019s lives less than the process.\u201d",
      "Harris seemed to absorb some lessons from her first major decision as San Francisco district attorney. Four years later, she again declined to pursue the death penalty after a dramatic killing, but this time, she better understood how her decision would reverberate.",
      "Tony Bologna had been driving in San Francisco with his three sons when their vehicle was barraged by gunfire. Bologna and two of his sons were killed; his third son was critically injured.",
      "Shortly after the killing, police arrested Edwin Ramon Uma\u00f1a, an undocumented member of the MS-13 gang who had evidently mistaken the 49-year old Bologna for a sworn enemy.",
      "This time, Harris opted to deliver the difficult news about her prosecutorial decision to Bologna\u2019s widow Danielle herself, recalls Matt Davis, who was representing Danielle Bologna in a civil suit against the city at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was no surprise that Danielle had a very strong, negative reaction to the news,\u201d Mr Davis told the BBC in a recent interview. \u201cShe made it clear that she was upset, and Kamala listened to her and expressed her sympathies but stayed pretty firm.\u201d",
      "The meeting left an indelible impression on Davis. He had befriended Harris in law school in San Francisco, and when she had first revealed her plans to run for D.A., he remembers thinking she didn\u2019t have a chance.",
      "But he says that painful conversation made him realise he had underestimated her.",
      "\u201cThat was not an easy thing to do,\u201d Mr Davis said.",
      "Progressive prosecutor?",
      "Over the span of her law enforcement career, Harris\u2019s allies sought to paint her as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d committed to criminal justice reform but also tough on crime.",
      "It was a fine line to walk in a liberal city in the country\u2019s largest left-leaning state, and one that critics on both sides of the political aisle say she did not stick to.",
      "As district attorney, she adopted a so-called \u201csmart-on-crime\u201d philosophy, which included initiatives to keep non-violent offenders out of prison by steering them into job training programs and ensuring young offenders remained in school.",
      "Niki Solis, an attorney in the San Francisco public defender\u2019s office who worked opposite Harris in the early 2000s, said she had been receptive to her concerns about how young victims of sex trafficking were being charged with prostitution, as opposed to being treated as victims.",
      "\u201cI realised that she understood issues that a lot of her predecessors and a lot of [district attorneys] up and down the state failed to understand or even acknowledge,\u201d said Ms Solis.",
      "Trump and his allies on the right have sought to play up this time in her career, depicting her as part of a \u201cSan Francisco liberal elite\u201d. But on the left of politics, she has been accused of not being reform-minded enough, with some on social media nicknaming her \u201cKamala the cop\u201d.",
      "But by the time Harris was elected as California\u2019s attorney general, in 2010, her progressive tendencies appeared to have given way to political pragmatism.",
      "\"She was seeking more of a national profile. She wanted to make a mark. There was definitely an expectation of an interesting future to come,\u201d said Gil Duran, who worked for Harris in the attorney general\u2019s office for a few months.",
      "\"The attorney general - usually a sleepy backwater of an office - was now home to a rising star.\"",
      "On the national stage, Harris began to make her mark. In 2012, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Harris threatened to walk away from negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and five US banks. California was set to receive around $4 billion in the initial deal, and Harris eventually secured $18 billion for the state.",
      "The Harris campaign has highlighted this case on the campaign trail as more proof she\u2019s willing to stand up to powerful interests.",
      "But more recent reporting shows that only $4.5 billion of the settlement ended up going towards California homeowners who had been ripped off by lenders.",
      "In moves that angered some liberals, she implemented a school truancy program state-wide, which some county prosecutors used to arrest parents. And she defied a Supreme Court order to reduce overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons.",
      "She also reversed her previous position on the death penalty in 2014 when, as attorney general, she appealed a lower court\u2019s ruling that found it was unconstitutional. Now, the prosecutor who once refused to sentence violent murderers to death on the basis that \"there is no exception to principle\" was defending the state\u2019s right to do just that.",
      "Hadar Aviram, a criminal justice and civil rights professor who petitioned Harris to leave the decision in place, was one of many critics of her stance.",
      "\u201cYou are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,\u201d she told CNN in 2019 of the episode. \u201cIf you truly believe that they\u2019re morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it\u2019s an imperative to do so.\u201d",
      "Former San Francisco city attorney Louise Renne, who worked with Harris when she first left Oakland, said the torrent of criticism she faced over her support for the death penalty was unfair.",
      "\u201cThe thing is when you\u2019re state attorney general, you have to defend the law. That\u2019s your obligation,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201c I don\u2019t regard that as a weakness or a valid criticism at all.\u201d",
      "But Harris was selective about which laws she enforced. In 2004, when Gavin Newsom, then San Francisco's mayor, decided to allow same-sex weddings, in violation of state law, Harris helped officiate a few of the ceremonies, calling it \u201cone of the most joyful\u201d moments of her career.",
      "Her long record as a prosecutor would prove tricky when, after being elected to the US Senate in 2016, Harris decided to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "She chose to kick off her 2020 presidential run just blocks away from the Alameda County Courthouse, the same place where she first uttered the words, \u201cfor the people\u201d \u2013 which would become part of her campaign slogan.",
      "But in the midst of her campaign, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was murdered by a police officer during an arrest, igniting a nationwide racial reckoning and demand for criminal justice reform. Her past defence of the death penalty, and resistance to prison reform, earned her criticism from her party\u2019s left-flank.",
      "She dropped out of the presidential race before the primary contests to choose a Democratic contender had even begun.",
      "Reinvented again",
      "Now, as Harris campaigns for president against Donald Trump, she is again calling attention to her prosecutorial bona-fides, but reframed in a new political atmosphere.",
      "While many cities, including San Francisco, experimented with progressive police reform after Floyd\u2019s murder, a spike in crime and homelessness during the pandemic has triggered a public backlash against so-called \u201csoft on crime\u201d policies. Republicans have also heavily focused on political messaging around crime and public safety in recent years.",
      "Harris\u2019s past as a prosecutor is no longer such a liability, and in a race against the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes, the narrative aligns with the political moment.",
      "Notably, at the Democratic National Convention this summer, abolishing the death penalty was dropped from the party platform.",
      "And while in 2020, Harris was trying to win over left-leaning Democrats, she is now explicitly making a pitch for moderate Republicans who may be fed up with Trump. To do that, she has shifted a number of her positions - from border security to single-payer health care - to the centre.",
      "This has led to accusations from her opponents that she is a flip-flopper.",
      "She\u2019s \u201ca chameleon\u201d, Trump\u2019s running mate and Ohio Senator JD Vance told CNN in August. \u201cShe pretends to be one thing in front of one audience and she pretends to be something different in front of another audience.\u201d",
      "But Mr Duran, Harris's former colleague in the attorney general\u2019s office, sees it less as a matter of political scrupulousness and more simply a sign of her political pragmatism.",
      "\"I think she does have conviction but it\u2019s really hard to run a campaign on your convictions alone, for the most part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kamala Harris we\u2019re seeing now is very much poll and focus-group driven.\u201d",
      "What Harris really stands for has been a question that has dogged her throughout her career - and continues to follow her on her bid for the Oval Office. But to Mr Brokaw, her former campaign manager, she has always operated on her own terms.",
      "\u201cShe has carved her own path and left a whole bunch of people behind who counted her out and underestimated her,\u201d he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 02:45:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Two UK-based Africans tell the BBC how they are digging deep into their culture to change home decor.",
    "story": [
      "After more than a decade as a lawyer at high-powered banking firms like Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nigerian-British Kelechi Ejikeme left the corporate world to follow her passion for interior design.",
      "Her rug collection is inspired by Nigeria's diverse terrain - rolling hills, winding rivers, sprawling savannahs and dense forests, and reminds me of the view from planes.",
      "\"So, when you interpret that into a rug or a carpet, it\u2019s symbolic,\" she said when I met her at her stall at the Decorex interior design show held in London last month.",
      "\"It\u2019s like, every minute, this is what we're actually every day stepping on.\"",
      "Made from jute, a durable and eco-friendly material, each rug integrates these natural elements.",
      "Jute is typically cultivated locally for its edible leaves, not for fibre. It comes from the same plant used for ewedu soup, a staple in south-western Nigeria.",
      "To bring her vision to life, Ejikeme has her rugs produced in India and Nepal, where jute is more widely developed into a thriving industry.",
      "Also at the event was Amechi Mandi, a Cameroonian-Nigerian interior designer who won House & Garden magazine\u2019s Rising Star award in 2022.",
      "He was not showcasing any of his work but had just spoken in a side session about his transition from fashion to interior design.",
      "Mandi holds a degree in furniture and product design, but after working in the fashion industry and later at a design firm, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of genuine African-inspired interior textiles.",
      "Too often, he found, they relied on \"clich\u00e9d\", post-colonial motifs.",
      "This led him to explore his Cameroonian and Nigerian heritage, with a focus on pre-colonial traditions.",
      "Recognising the untapped potential of indigenous textiles fading from memory -especially with the rise of \"ankara\" wax prints, a European import that has come to symbolise African design - Mandi set out to revive these cultural elements.",
      "He began integrating traditional techniques and patterns into his designs, and his work now includes a popular collection of cushions and throws, as well as a successful wallpaper collaboration.",
      "\"People have told me, 'Oh, your work is not African,' because they want to see ankara prints. It's been so impressed in the minds,\" Mandi told me.",
      "\"I get inspiration from indigenous traditions and cultures, and then, I give it a more contemporary spin,\" he added.",
      "Listening to Mandi made me realise how much I, too, had come to associate modern African design with ankara fabrics.",
      "This textile has dominated African fashion and design, making its mark on global stages in recent decades.",
      "And so, as I wandered through the exhibition, it was easy to assume that African designs were absent from this notable gathering.",
      "When she first started, Ejikeme juggled both law and interior design, working in one during the week and the other on weekends. It did not take long for her to realise where her true passion lay.",
      "\"In one world, you\u2019re trying to contain your energy or yourself or your expression just so that you don\u2019t ruffle feathers, while in another world your energy, you can\u2019t even extinguish it,\" she said.",
      "Since making the leap to full-time design six years ago, she has tackled a variety of projects, from homes and workplaces to movie sets.",
      "Last year, she launched her own rug collection, adding a new dimension to her work from her Swallow and Tea studio.",
      "\"It\u2019s a really new thing and I\u2019ve only had two shows but so far I\u2019ve had mostly residential and retail buyers mainly from Europe probably because my first show was in Belgium. Decorex was my first UK show,\" Ejikeme said.",
      "Most of Mandi\u2019s customers are Europeans, a trend he attributes to a prevailing preference among many Africans for foreign products.",
      "\"Most Africans still prefer to buy a Gucci,\" he said.",
      "\"I do have a few Africans buying but they are not like everyday Africans. They were all people who were born and bred abroad and are deep into African heritage and culture.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi concur that interior design in Africa is still in its developmental stages.",
      "In contrast to fashion, which has long been a significant focus for Africans and has recently experienced remarkable growth, the field of African interior design is just starting to establish itself.",
      "Ejikeme reflected on her first independent project in 2013, which coincided with a new wave of Africans in London entering high-paying fields like investment banking.",
      "She aimed to create spaces that not only exuded luxury and comfort but also captured a sense of home for her African clients, reflecting their heritage in a meaningful way.",
      "\"I was stumped because I'm somebody who loves antiques. I love old design. When I was in design school in London, my favourite thing was history of design, like learning about all the different periods - Victorian, Edwardian, etc - and what distinguished one from the other.",
      "\"But there was no such thing in Africa. There's nothing like the history of African design because we haven't really kept that track,\" she said.",
      "This realisation motivated her to begin categorising African design periods to better understand and preserve the continent's design evolution, an ongoing project she began during her past 10 years living in Nigeria before returning to London last year.",
      "Ejikeme visited places like the Bogobiri art gallery in Lagos, which displayed a mixture of old sculpture and modern art.",
      "She also visited sellers in quiet corners of Nigerian markets, where she came across staffs of office used by Igbo elders in precolonial times. She began categorising these objects she came across according to their period in history, whether late 1990s or pre-colonial.",
      "She has not yet finished and wants to devote more time to it to use them in her interior design projects.",
      "Mandi believes that following trends in how we design our homes and other spaces was historically never an African thing, especially with the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade.",
      "\"Traditionally, interiors have never been a priority. We have always been into functionality. We were more into decorating our exteriors, like painting the walls, painting the outside,\" he said.",
      "\"Each civilization has evolved, but we didn\u2019t have the chance to evolve because of the 400 years we were arrested with the transatlantic slave trade.\"",
      "He added that Africans were in \"constant flight\" during the slave trade, so \"how can you think, 'I have this house, I have to make the inside fine, let me put that bench, let me weave this cloth'? Our society didn't have the chance to evolve like that.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi noted that many wealthy and prominent Africans, from celebrities to entrepreneurs, often have interiors that lack a distinctly African identity.",
      "However, Ejikeme believes this is changing as more Africans gain disposable income, they are increasingly investing in decorating their homes in a way that tells their personal story and captures their experiences.",
      "\"If you have a product that can be made beautiful, and exquisite, and sort of memorable, that tells some kind of story or has some kind of meaning, it will appeal to Africans and other people that are not African,\" she says.",

    "title": "Hunt for Bitcoin's elusive creator Satoshi Nakamoto hits another dead-end",
    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:51:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why are still no closer to unmasking the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto?",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, is now traded by the world's biggest investment houses and is even an official currency in one country.",
      "But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?",
      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",
      "There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.",
      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",
      "I declined.",
      "Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation.",
      "As it happened, seating wasn\u2019t a problem.",
      "Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.",
      "Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.",
      "After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.",
      "It was an unpromising start, and things only got worse from there.",
      "Mr Anderson invited \"Satoshi\" to come on stage.",
      "A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: \u201cI am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.\u201d",
      "Over the following hour, reporters went from amused to irritated as he failed to provide any of the promised evidence for his claims.",
      "Mr Mollah promised that he would make the Hail-Mary move of unlocking and interacting with the first-ever Bitcoins to be created - something that only Satoshi could do.",
      "But he didn't.",
      "I departed, along with other bemused reporters, taking with us any lingering doubts that this would prove to be yet another dead-end in the quest to unmask Satoshi.",
      "What is Bitcoin? Key crypto terms and what they mean",
      "Not another one",
      "The list of those identified - unsuccessfully - as Satoshi Nakamoto is long.",
      "In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek said it was Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California.",
      "But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.",
      "A year later, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright was outed as Satoshi by reporters.",
      "He denied it, before saying it was true - but then failed over many years to produce any evidence.",
      "In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.",
      "Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.",
      "Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?",
      "The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.",
      "Perhaps there\u2019s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.",
      "Peter Todd, who was named by the HBO documentary as being Satoshi, said the unwelcome attention he's received has made him fearful for his safety.",
      "Many in the crypto world enjoy the fact that the mystery remains unsolved.",
      "\"No-one knows who Satoshi is and that's a good thing,\" Adam Back, one of its core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X recently.",
      "Natalie Brunell, a Bitcoin podcaster, thinks Satoshi's anonymity is not only deliberate but essential.",
      "\"By concealing his true identity, Satoshi ensured that Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t have a leader or central figure, whose personal agenda could influence the protocol,\" she told me.",
      "\"This allows people to trust Bitcoin as a system, rather than placing their trust in an individual or company.\"",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University - who lectures on the history of Bitcoin - is less sure.",
      "In her view, the circus around who Satoshi Nakamoto is distracts from people looking into - and getting to grips with - the more serious question of how cryptocurrencies might upend the way the economy works.",
      "As I left the Frontline Club it was hard to compute the bizarre press event, beyond one obvious fact.",
      "For now - and perhaps forever - the search for Satoshi continues.",

      "It's the main production centre for weight loss drug Wegovy. Semaglutide, used in Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic, is made in a factory here, and parent company Novo Nordisk has invested more than $8.5 billion (\u00a36.5bn) in the town. That's nearly the entire GDP of Monaco.",
      "But persuading people to actually live in the town could prove tricky.",
      "There's an influx of workers and builders at the factory in the morning and an exodus in the afternoon - locals call it the \"Novo Queue\" and recommend avoiding the town's road for these hours each day.",
      "Hardly any of the workers stay - they live outside and drive in.",
      "So when there's \u00a3400,000 of investment per resident, what's there not to like?",
      "Behind the rosy figures, Kalundborg faces many challenges, from rundown schools and low incomes to many children being overweight.",
      "State school grades in Danish language and maths here are below the national average. Some on the town's periphery have few facilities inside or out, with just old swings in the playground.",
      "\u201cIf you saw that, you will take one of the big cities around here and say, 'Well, we will live there and then I can drive to Kalundborg to work,'\" regional councillor Helle Laursen Petersen tells me.",
      "She says these schools are struggling to attract experienced teachers, helping to fuel low expectations among many parents.",
      "After all, she says, they think their children will always get a job at the Novo Nordisk factory, so why bother trying to get to university?",
      "Ali, Anna K, Anna and Marie at Gymnasium, the most academic secondary school in the area, tell me they want to leave to study.",
      "\"It might become interesting later, but as of now, I think it's a bit too boring to settle down here -\u00a0I think I'd like a larger city,\" Anna K says.",
      "But Ali and Marie are more excited about coming back after their studies, hopeful of more job opportunities in the town so they can enjoy its natural beauty more.",
      "Problems - and hope",
      "Meanwhile Brian Sonder Anderson, who runs the Blue Angel cinema and is head of the local trader\u2019s association, points out that supermarkets and bakeries are booming locally as factory workers flock to them on their lunch breaks.",
      "But other shops, such as those selling shoes and clothes, quickly open then shut down again because of the number of workers living elsewhere.",
      "Many families on low incomes live here, priced out of the capital Copenhagen where rents and property prices have soared - leaving some on benefits and others relying on work at the factory.",
      "Kalundborg also has a health problem - it's in the highest 5% of Danish towns for children being overweight.",
      "Novo Nordisk, meanwhile, is now Europe's most valuable company with a revenue last year of more than $33bn - bringing its market value to more than $500bn.",
      "Investment in the town aims to add 1,250 jobs to the existing 4,500 employees at the Kalundborg plant and ramp up production of its best-selling drugs. While the company represents about 1% of the Danish workforce, it accounts for a more sizeable proportion of its growth.",
      "Denmark's economic growth was 1.1% over the first nine months of 2023. But strip away the pharmaceutical sector, dominated by Novo, and the economy shrank by 0.8%. Some analysts have warned that parts of the country's economy risks becoming too reliant on the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "The town's mayor Martin Damm is upbeat, insisting that more than 1,000 new jobs are being created here every year and some young people are happy to call it home.",

      "Its share price has plummeted and this week it narrowly avoided being delisted from the stock market.",
      "And of course this is a company that holds the most sensitive data imaginable about its customers, raising troubling questions about what might happen to its huge \u2013 and extremely valuable \u2013 database of individual human DNA.",
      "When contacted by the BBC, 23andMe was bullish about its prospects - and insistent it remained \"committed to protecting customer data and consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers.\"",
      "But how did what was once one of the most talked-about tech firms get to the position where it has to answer questions about its very survival?",
      "DNA gold rush",
      "Not so long ago, 23andMe was in the public eye for all the right reasons.",

      "Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "According to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.",
      "Firstly, it didn\u2019t really have a continuing business model \u2013 once you\u2019d paid for your DNA report, there was very little for you to return for.",
      "Secondly, plans to use an anonymised version of the gathered DNA database for drug research took too long to become profitable, because the drug development process takes so many years.",
      "That leads him to a blunt conclusion: \u201cIf I had a crystal ball, I\u2019d say they will maybe last for a bit longer,\u201d he told the BBC.",
      "\u201cBut as it currently is, in my view, 23andMe is highly unlikely to survive.\u201d",

      "What happens to the DNA?",
      "Companies rising and falling is nothing new - especially in tech. But 23andMe is different.",
      "\"It's worrying because of the sensitivity of the data,\" says Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power.",
      "And that is not just for the individuals who have used the firm.",
      "\"If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,\" she told the BBC.",
      "David Stillwell, professor of computational social science at Cambridge Judge Business School, agrees the stakes are high.",

    "story": [
      "Let's face it: this presidential campaign is not gonna win any awards for civility. Policy proposals aside, there's been name-calling, vulgarity, and plain old meanness. And at times, it can seem like the rudeness of our politics has infected our personal interactions as well.",

      "Want proof? Babies and toddlers react in predictable ways to both the tone of someone's voice and the expression on their face. Children learn to trust certain voices, even before they can understand the meaning of words. And chances are, an angry, loud voice will elicit fear and the very opposite of trust. \u00a0 Those deeply-ingrained responses follow us through life, and can help or hinder our interactions with others.",
      "If we really want to have conversations instead of dueling monologues, we need to be genuinely curious about what the other person has to say. And if the way we communicate \u2013 not just the words but the way we say them \u2013 triggers mistrust, there's little hope for a meaningful exchange of ideas. \u00a0 Let's be clear: a mean thing said nicely is still mean. And there are times when a warm and compassionate tone will do you little good: for instance, arguments with people who disregard facts.",
      "But for all those other times, consider taking a lesson from children. The next time you strike up a conversation with somebody who has an opposing view, try using a kind and gentle tone.

    "title": "What Colonial Williamsburg may teach us about politics today",
    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 09:56:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The Colonial Era living history museum in Williamsburg, Virginia, offers an enlightening portrait of life in Revolutionary-era America, while providing a vivid contrast to today's political and social conflicts.",
    "story": [
      "Colonial Williamsburg, capital of the British colony of Virginia, has been preserved as a sprawling museum. Its mission: that \"the future may learn from the past.\"",
      "The crown jewels of Williamsburg, Virginia, are the interpreters, interacting with audiences of our day, but in the context of the world as they would have known it in their time.",
      "By way of example, Thomas Jefferson welcomes visitors: \"Good day, friends. How are you faring? You have no complaints? You must not be Virginians! If not from Virginia, where from? Pennsylvania, land of religious anarchy? Welcome! The Ohio Territories? From terra incognito. Welcome to civilization! Upper Canada? Bonjour! Are you immigrating here? Oh, you should. We are trying to encourage immigrants to immigrate here.\"",
      "Indeed, immigration was highly controversial in Jefferson's time, but from a radically different perspective than ours. I raised the issue with Kurt Smith (who personifies Thomas Jefferson), and Katherine Pittman (a very feisty Martha Washington).",
      "\"It was there in 1776,\" said Smith, \"in the Declaration of Independence. You know that middle bit that everyone skips? In the 27 long train of abuses, Jefferson says, 'He [the king] has prevented immigration.' It is one of the reasons we declare independence.\"",
      "Pittman asked, \"And how can we improve if we never welcome anything new?\"",
      "\"We're not talking about 'never' welcoming anything new,\" Koppel said. \"We need to know who's coming. We need to know whether they are people of good character. Isn't that what the argument is about?\"",
      "\"It's the argument in your time,\" Pittman said. \"We can just speak to our time.\"",
      "\"Oh, cut it out!\"",
      "\"You started it!\" Pittman laughed.",
      "\"I'm in a pissing match with Mrs. Washington, for God's sake!\" said Koppel.",
      "\"I think I'm gonna win!\" she laughed.",
      "The interpreters are well advised to merely hint at the issues of our day. Jefferson (Smith) opined, \"How do you get a body of men to vote for something because it's the right thing to do? I don't know. Maybe your politicians do it all the time!\" The audience was amused.",
      "Visitors to Williamsburg are left to grapple with the actual political problems of 2024. One woman remarked, \"There are certain people that want all the power, like the king. They wanted the power over everybody, and I think that's what's happening now.\"",
      "One young woman said, \"This country is steeped in conflict and a fight for liberty. But I truly hope I get to live in a world where I have rights to my body.\"",
      "\"Abortion,\" asked Koppel. \"You feel strongly about that?\"",
      "\"I do,\" she replied.",
      "It's a subject on which Martha Washington also has her own views on, c. 1800. In that era, she said, the issue was dealt with from within the home: \"Birth and a woman's health is a woman's sphere,\" she said. \"One does not need to ascertain the services of a midwife if that is the course that you are wishing. These remedies are known amongst female kind. It is known in the indigenous communities. It is known in the African culture. It is known in our European cultures as well, be it different herbs, be it different techniques, in order to rid one's self of an unwanted child. But generally, they are held within the female sex. But I know that my husband, General Washington, would be in full support of whatever I wanted to do with my own person.\"",
      "An even more contentious issue, then and now, was race. In Jefferson's day, that meant slavery. Despite owning more than 600 enslaved men, women and children, Jefferson put forward legislation in 1779 to end the practice. \"But here's the problem,\" Jefferson said. \"Bill 51, making the slave trade illegal, has to be presented to a body of men, all of whom own \u2026 what?\"",
      "Williamsburg chooses to depict slavery in a particularly dramatic, and unrepresentative, fashion, in the person of James Lafayette, an enslaved man who was directed to meet with the Marquis de Lafayette, the French nobleman who served the American cause (and whose name James would ultimately adopt).",
      "Lafayette asked James to sneak across the British lines as a fake runaway slave, to ingratiate himself with the officers of the British army, and then report back what he heard. James succeeded so brilliantly that he eventually worked directly under General Lord Cornwallis. \"I could take that British intelligence and information and share it with the American side over and over again, which I did,\" James said.",
      "He faithfully served the American cause, but he said, \"I was not to be given my freedom for what I had done for American independence. I was sent back to slavery. I was sent back to Master William for six more years.\"",
      "Only after the Marquis de Lafayette petitioned the Virginia legislature for his freedom would it eventually be granted.",
      "Given that extraordinary backstory, I wondered how Stephen Seals (who interprets James) deals with taking on that role. \"You understand that so many of the issues that we deal with today are connected to many of the decisions that were made in the colonial area,\" Seals said. \"You can see the line from one to the other. And when you come to terms and you see that, I got very depressed, and I almost left. I almost quit.\"",
      "Then, a colleague reminded him he was giving a voice to ancestors denied one during their own lifetimes. \"And the moment she said that to me, I had few issues with the fact that I had to play an enslaved person every single day, because I now understood why I was doing it,\" he said. \"So, I love what I do, it's an honor doing what I do, but I live out in the middle of nowhere for a reason, because when I'm done here, I want to go and be away from it all. It's how I cope.\"",
      "Finally, there's the father of our nation, George Washington. \"When we began, I mentioned that we should avoid seeing factions arise,\" he said. \"I specifically mentioned by regional distinction, but it is just as important that we endeavor to avoid seeing factions arise by the spirit and fury of party politics.\"",
      "Asked by a visitor whom he would support in the 2024 presidential race, Washington replied, \"I'm not sure what you mean by presidential race, sir. Do you mean the election? Race? Can you imagine how lacking of any sort of virtue or dignity a race would have? We stand for elections, sir; we certainly don't run for it!\"",
      "Ron Carnegie gives a striking portrayal of the man who could have been president for life, but chose a different path. \"Very often when I'm talking to people at the end, somebody in that group will say, 'I wish President Washington was running today,'\" Carnegie said. \"There's no way a man like President Washington could be president today.\"",
      "Because? \"He is aloof, he's not friendly, he's not outgoing, he doesn't like to talk in public. And he doesn't want the job. And how are you gonna become President today if you don't want the job?\"",
      "That wasn't a problem in 1800. John Adams very much wanted to keep the job; Thomas Jefferson wanted to take it.",
      "Smith noted, \"Things are just as nasty in the 18th century as they are in the 21st. There are newspapers that called John Adams pretty awful things. And there were terrible things thrown in Jefferson's corner. There were New Englanders and New England newspapers that were certain that if Jefferson was elected president, he would personally go into their homes and steal their Bibles.\"",
      "John Adams lost that election, and conceded. \"Jefferson calls that election of 1800 the Second American Revolution,\" said Smith. \"And it was precisely because, for the first time in this country, there was a change in political party at the very top of government, and it was peaceful. It was a peaceful transfer of power. That's powerful.\"",
      "That had never happened before, but it set a precedent that lasted \u2013 until our time.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 07:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Run for Recovery, a new program, offers a boot camp for people in recovery from substance use who dream of holding political office.",
    "story": [
      "Thomas Higdon was a politics fanatic his entire life: He kept up on the news cycle, he door-knocked for candidates, and he volunteered for a number of campaigns.",
      "He long dreamed of working in government, but he and everyone around him felt it wouldn't be possible because of his substance use. His use of alcohol and other drugs began causing problems when he was in law school in the mid-1990s, and in 2014, the consequences of his substance use left him living under an overpass. He is now abstinent from the drugs, but even years later, he felt he had ruined his chances of running for office.",
      "\"I allowed this internalized stigma, over decades, to blind me to what I could really do,\" Higdon, now 52, told CBS News.",
      "That thought stayed with him for years. He moved into grassroots organizing and advocacy spaces, but in 2023, he learned about the Recovery Advocacy Project's upcoming \"Run for Recovery\" program \u2014 and realized that working in public office might still be possible.",
      "Building a political bootcamp for people in recovery",
      "Courtney Gary-Allen, who began using drugs at a young age and overdosed multiple times before getting sober in 2015, has successfully run for office twice. In 2020, she was elected to the position of at-large City Councilor in Augusta, Maine. She was reelected to the same role in 2023. Both times, she won in a landslide, but the experience made her realize the need for a campaign bootcamp centered around people in recovery. Similar bootcamps are conducted by major political parties, but she wanted to create a bipartisan space tailored to the recovery community's specific experiences and needs.",
      "\"For the last decade or so, the recovery movement in America has been very focused on telling our stories and advocating and pushing for better policy around substance use disorder and recovery efforts, and I think this is a new chapter in the story of the recovery advocacy movement,\" said Gary-Allen, who is also the organizing director at the Maine Advocacy Recovery Project. \"We're no longer just advocating to policymakers. We are running for office to become the policymakers that are making decisions around these issues and many more.\"",
      "From that idea, Run for Recovery was born. The program graduated its inaugural class, made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and five Independents, in August 2024. The 15 participants were selected from across the country. Once a month for a year, they met online to talk the ins and outs of mounting a campaign. Lessons ranged from learning about finance laws to drafting position statements to preparing to talk openly about their substance abuse.",
      "Higdon was one of the selected participants. Even though he had \"been around campaigns all (his) life,\" he said the Run for Recovery class educated him about the technicalities of running for office. But it wasn't just the classroom learning that inspired him. When he started the class, \"there was still that sort of nagging voice in the back of your head of 'You can't run,'\" Higdon said. The time with his classmates helped change his perspective.",
      "\"I just can't express how good it felt to be around people who also wanted to do this thing,\" Higdon said. \"There are a number of reasons why I ultimately may not run, but fear of what people will say and that stigma won't be one of them.\"",
      "Mobilize Recovery founder Ryan Hampton, who completed the Run for Recovery program and is campaigning for a seat in Nevada's state assembly, said that stigma has affected his campaign. He said his campaign has been subject to attack ads bringing up his history of substance use and calling his policy positions to a \"dangerous drug agenda.\"",
      "It's a stressful time, Hampton said, but lessons he's learned throughout his recovery journey and from the Run for Recovery program have helped him continue his campaign.",
      "\"I am certainly the underdog in this race, but I'm used to it,\" Hampton said. \"Am I afraid of losing an election? No, I have lost a lot more in my life than an election. I am not afraid of losing. I'm running to win, but I'm also running because I believe our community is yearning for something different.\"",
      "Growing a movement",
      "There's no compiled list of every single person in recovery running for office. Gary-Allen said she was aware of several people in recovery running for office in Maine. Higdon is weighing a run for a seat in Maryland's state legislature. Racquel Garcia, a Run for Recovery graduate who holds an appointed position in Colorado, is considering a campaign for a state position in 2026.",
      "Gary-Allen said she hopes to see more of the Run for Recovery program graduates start their own campaigns \u2014 and see others in recovery, even people who didn't go through the program, make the jump into politics.",
      "\"I think we're on this cusp of a revelation. Not only are people in recovery voting and showing up and advocating, we're running for office, and we're going to serve in these seats,\" Gary-Allen said. \"We're going to help create solutions to substance use across the country. I'm excited for the next couple of election seasons.\"",

      "EMTs had found Smith barely conscious and unable to say anything about the shooting. They rushed him to the hospital and deputies searched the house. Later that day, crime scene investigator Josh Easton of the Illinois State Police was called to the scene and he began cataloging the mayhem inside.",

      "Sharon Costanza: Who? Yeah. Who would've done that?",
      "Investigators had the same questions about Reeves and learned that she was a divorced mother of two children who lived in Troy, about an hour south of Farmersville.

      "Nanette Stuiber told them the same thing she had told investigators: she suspected Reeves' ex-boyfriend Bobby Tarr. That night, sheriff's deputies went to Tarr's home in Collinsville, an hour south of the crime scene.

      "Detectives went back to Tarr and told him Shelby's story didn't match his. Tarr then changed his story and said he had gone to his friend's house twice, but still insisted he was home by 8 p.m. As Tarr sat at the police station, detectives searched his house and found his phone and a Glock pistol. Shelby had told them her father had a different gun, but they did not find it.",

      "Just a few weeks earlier, Steinhauer says, Reeves told her that Tarr had shown up while she was on a first date with a different guy. After that incident, Reeves told Steinhauer she was frightened by Tarr and texted Steinhauer: \"I could be killed by him someday if I don't cut all contact.\"",

      "A few days later they got another phone call. This time from Tarr's brother, asking them to come back to the house. Tarr's family gave deputies a Ziploc bag they said they had found in the same yard that had been searched just days earlier. Inside \u2014 a Springfield Hellcat 9 mm pistol and silver-colored ammunition. The Illinois State Police determined the gun was the murder weapon and the ammunition matched the casings found at the crime scene.",

      "Erin Moriarty: Are you saying you were set up? Someone was framing you?",

      "Bobby Tarr Nothing on the firearm, no DNA, no prints of mine on the firearm.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: What I think is, what happened is, is that the gun was cleaned. And that Mr. Tarr just missed a spot.",

      "Bobby Tarr insisted to \"48 Hours\"\u00a0 that Reeves owned the Hellcat that was used to kill her, but Howard says he never saw her use it.",
      "Howard Bolton: Leslie never brought, uh, a Springfield \u2026 \u00a0let alone a Hellcat \u2014 to class.",
      "So then how did Reeves' DNA get on the guide rod of the murder weapon? Howard believes that Reeves' DNA could only be on that guide rod if the gun was fired at her at close range.",
      "Howard Bolton: So when he shot her, wherever it was he shot her \u2026 would have contaminated that part of the gun.",
      "In fact, Howard says Reeves owned a different gun. Her friends say they wish she had taken it with her the night she was killed.",

      "THE CASE AGAINST BOBBY TARR",
      "When Bobby Tarr went on trial in April 2024, prosecutors told the jury that he killed Leslie Reeves rather than allow her to live the life she wanted; a life without him.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: Mr. Tarr \u2026 couldn't deal with the fact that Leslie was seeing somebody else and \u2026 he had to go and take care of it.",
      "Andrew Affrunti says Tarr secretly followed Reeves to Farmersville early that evening, and shortly afterwards his phone began showing some interesting activity.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: He had actually searched Chris Smith on his phone, had tried to find his Facebook profile.",
      "Tarr headed home and texted his friend Billy Adams, \"I don't feel like she would drive that far for a party or go out with a girlfriend. I think it's for a dude.\" He also searched whether police could track his phone if he was using a VPN \u2013 a virtual private network.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: He was researching to determine whether or not that would mask where his location was while he was using the phone.",
      "Authorities say around midnight, Tarr left home, stopping at that gas station. And then, according to Affrunti, surveillance videos and cell tower records show that Tarr drove back to Farmersville.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You believe he intended to kill both Chris and Leslie?",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I 100% believe that he went up there with the intent to do serious harm to both of them.",
      "With one victim dead and the other with no memory, it's difficult to say with certainty what happened. But the prosecution argued that sometime after 1 a.m., Tarr tried to enter through the back door of Smith's house. Reeves and Smith tried to keep him out.",
      "Josh Easton: There was some kind of altercation or struggle \u2026And that's when the glass was broken.",
      "Crime scene investigator Josh Easton told the jury what he'd observed inside the kitchen.",
      "Josh Easton: The refrigerator was pulled away from the wall from where it appeared it normally was.",
      "Prosecutors believe Reeves was trying to use the refrigerator to block the door. And based on where Smith was shot in his head, they think he was crouching down to help Reeves.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I think that \u2026 while Chris was crouched down trying to hold the door shut, uh, Bobby shot through the door and struck Chris.",
      "With Smith incapacitated, Affrunti says Reeves hid in the living room. Tarr tracked her down, shot and killed her.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: I strongly believe that \u2026 he walked in and executed her.",
      "Defense attorney Dan Fultz disputes all of that.",
      "Dan Fultz: There is simply no evidence \u2026 that that's what happened. There's no evidence that Leslie pushed the refrigerator. There's no fingerprints and blood \u2026 on the refrigerator of Leslie's.",
      "Fultz says evidence of a fight in the kitchen tells a different story.",
      "Dan Fultz: The amount of blood in that kitchen was astonishing.",
      "Erin Moriarty: From looking at that crime scene, do you believe that Christopher Smith had to fight his -- his assailant \u2026 in the kitchen?",
      "Dan Fultz: It would appear to me that there was \u2026 some significant struggle in that kitchen between him and someone else.",
      "And he says the assailant could not have been Tarr because he would have been covered in blood.",
      "Dan Fultz: They did not identify a single piece of DNA in his car, they didn't identify a bloody fingerprint, they did not identify anything tying him to that crime scene.",
      "But prosecutors argued the house wasn't bloody when Tarr left. They said Chris bled heavily in the 12 hours it took for help to arrive. And while the prosecution did not have a lot of forensic evidence linking Tarr to the crime scene, Affrunti says his phone activity, his lies to investigators, and the evidence found on the Hellcat all prove his guilt.",
      "Andrew Affrunti: When you put all of that together, that's when you get the clear picture of what happened.",
      "When it was the defense's turn, Tarr says he wanted to tell his story to the jury. But he chose not to testify.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Why didn't you just decide you were gonna talk to the jury and tell this story, if in fact you have a story to tell?",
      "Bobby Tarr: I should have, I very well should have.",
      "Dan Fultz: We made a strategic decision \u2026 because it may have opened the door for a whole lot of other more damaging evidence to be used, to cross examine him.",
      "The defense didn't put on any witnesses and counted on the jury to find reasonable doubt in the lack of physical evidence. After three hours, the jury found Bobby Tarr guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder.",
      "Two months later, Tarr was back in court for sentencing, and this time, so was Smith -- to tell the judge how the shooting impacted him and his family. Cameras were not allowed in the courtroom.",
      "Chris Smith (after sentencing) Lost my house, lost my truck \u2026 I mean, I've literally lost my life without being killed.",
      "While Smith was in a coma, he says looters descended on his house and stole his guitar and amps, even his above ground pool. Later, his house was sold at auction and then razed. All that's left is an empty lot.",
      "Tarr also spoke at his sentencing and denied shooting Reeves and Smith. The judge sentenced him to 85 years.",
      "Leslie Reeves' friends are focused on keeping her memory alive.",
      "Amy Steinhauer: I hope the rest of his time on this earth is hell.",
      "Howard Bolton: She was a light of a lot of people's lives. \u2026 She was always smiling. She was a very good mother, lived for her kids \u2026 And was an advocate and champion of women -- women's rights and especially women that were abused.",
      "Nanette Stuiber: If it can happen to her, it could happen to anyone. So we all need to be careful.",

    "story": [
      "A woman who pleaded guilty to dressing as a clown and in 1990 murdering the wife of a man she later married was released from prison Saturday, ending a case that has been strange even by Florida standards.",
      "Sheila Keen-Warren, 61, was released 18 months after she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for the shooting of Marlene Warren, Florida Department of Corrections records show. The plea deal came shortly before her trial would have started.",
      "Keen-Warren, who has maintained her innocence even after her plea, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. But she had been in custody for seven years since her arrest in 2017, and Florida's law in 1990 allowed significant credit for good behavior. It had been expected she would be released in about two years.",
      "\"Sheila Keen-Warren will always be an admitted convicted murderer and will wear that stain for every day for the rest of her life,\" Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said in a statement Saturday.",
      "Greg Rosenfeld, Keen-Warren's attorney, has said she only took the plea deal because she would be released in less than two years and had been facing a life sentence if convicted at trial.",
      "\"We are absolutely thrilled that Ms. Keen-Warren has been released from prison and is returning to her family. As we've stated from the beginning, she did not commit this crime,\" he said Saturday in a text message.",
      "Marlene Warren's son, Joseph Ahrens, and his friends were at home when they said a person dressed as a clown rang the door bell. He said that when his mom answered, the clown handed her some balloons. After she responded, \"How nice,\" the clown pulled a gun and shot her in the face before fleeing.",
      "Palm Beach County sheriff's investigators had long suspected Keen-Warren in the slaying, but she wasn't arrested until 27 years later when they said improved DNA testing tied her to evidence found in the getaway car. Rosenfeld has called that evidence weak.",
      "At the time of the shooting, Keen-Warren was an employee of Marlene Warren's husband, Michael, at his used car lot. Since 2002, she has been his wife \u2014 they eventually moved to Abington, Virginia, where they ran a restaurant just across the Tennessee border.",
      "Witnesses told investigators in 1990 that the then-Sheila Keen and Michael Warren were having an affair, though both denied it.",
      "Over the years, detectives said, costume shop employees identified Sheila Warren as the woman who had bought a clown suit a few days before the killing.",
      "And one of the two balloons \u2014 a silver one that read, \"You're the Greatest\" \u2014 was sold at only one store, a Publix supermarket near Keen-Warren's home. Employees told detectives a woman who looked like Keen-Warren had bought the balloons an hour before the shooting.",
      "The presumed getaway car was found abandoned with orange, hair-like fibers inside. The white Chrysler convertible had been reported stolen from Michael Warren's car lot a month before the shooting. Keen-Warren and her then-husband repossessed cars for him.",
      "Relatives told The Palm Beach Post in 2000 that Marlene Warren, who was 40 when she died, suspected her husband was having an affair and wanted to leave him. But the car lot and other properties were in her name, and she feared what might happen if she did.",
      "She allegedly told her mother, \"If anything happens to me, Mike done it.\" He has never been charged and has denied involvement.",
      "But Rosenfeld said last year that the state's case was falling apart. One DNA sample somehow showed both male and female genes, he said, and the other could have come from one out of every 20 women.",
      "And even if that hair did come from Keen-Warren, it could have been deposited before the car was reported stolen. He said Marlene Warren's son and another witness also told detectives that the car deputies found wasn't the killer's, though investigators insisted it was.",
      "Aronberg last year conceded that there were holes in the case, saying they were caused by the three decades it took to get it to trial, including the death of key witnesses.",
      "Michael Warren was convicted in 1994 of grand theft, racketeering and odometer tampering. He served almost four years in prison \u2014 a punishment his then-attorneys said was disproportionately long because of suspicions he was involved in his wife's death.",

      "The lawsuit only named Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold that includes most of the city of Atlanta and is home to 11% of the state's voters. But at least five other populous counties that tend to vote for Democrats also announced election offices would open over the weekend to allow hand return of absentee ballots.",
      "The lawsuit was filed late Friday and cited a section of Georgia law that says ballot drop boxes cannot be open past the end of advance voting, which ended Friday. But state law says voters can deliver their absentee ballots in person to county election offices until the close of polls at 7 p.m. on Election Day. Despite that clear wording, lawyer Alex Kaufman initially claimed in an emergency hearing Saturday that voters aren't allowed to hand-deliver absentee ballots that were mailed to them.",
      "Kaufman then argued that voters should be blocked from hand-delivering their ballots between the close of early in-person voting on Friday and the beginning of Election Day on Tuesday, even though he said it was fine for ballots to arrive by mail during that period. It has long been the practice for Georgia election offices to accept mail ballots over the counter.",

      "Southwest District Health appears to be the first in the nation to be restricted from giving COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccinations are an essential function of a public health department.",
      "While policymakers in Texas banned health departments from promoting COVID vaccines and Florida's surgeon general bucked medical consensus to recommend against the vaccine, governmental bodies across the country haven't blocked the vaccines outright.",
      "\"I'm not aware of anything else like this,\" said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. She said health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand, but not based on \"a judgment of the medical product itself.\"",
      "The six-county district along the Idaho-Oregon border includes three counties in the Boise metropolitan area. Demand for COVID vaccines in the health district has declined \u2014 with 1,601 given in 2021 to 64 so far in 2024. The same is true for other vaccines: Idaho has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the nation, and last year, the Southwest District Health Department rushed to contain a rare measles outbreak that sickened 10.",
      "On Oct. 22, the health department's board voted 4-3 in favor of the ban \u2014 despite Southwest's medical director testifying to the vaccine's necessity.",

      "Opposite Jansen's plea were more than 290 public comments, many of which called for an end to vaccine mandates or taxpayer funding of the vaccines, neither of which are happening in the district. At the meeting, many people who spoke are nationally known for making the rounds to testify against COVID vaccines, including Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas cardiologist who sells \"contagion emergency kits\" that include ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 drugs that have not been approved to treat COVID-19 and can have dangerous side effects.",
      "Board Chairman Kelly Aberasturi was familiar with many of the voices who wanted the ban, especially from earlier local protests of pandemic measures.",
      "Aberasturi, who told The Associated Press that he's skeptical of COVID-19 vaccines and national public health leaders, said in the meeting and in an interview with the AP that he was supportive of but \"disappointed\" in the board's decision.",
      "He said the board had overstepped the relationship between patients and their doctors \u2014 and possibly opened a door to blocking other vaccines or treatments.",
      "Board members in favor of the decision argued people can get vaccinated elsewhere, and that providing the shots was equivalent to signing off on their safety. (Some people may be reluctant to get vaccinated or boosted because of misinformation about the shots despite evidence that they're safe and have saved millions of lives.)",
      "The people getting vaccinated at the health department \u2014 including people without housing, people who are homebound and those in long-term care facilities or in the immigration process \u2014 had no other options, Jansen and Aberasturi said.",

      "She is not alone in her belief. Widespread skepticism about Richardson's death underscores deep-seated distrust of local law enforcement in Colbert County. In a region where hanging invokes a long history of state-sanctioned lynchings for Black people, residents in the county allege a pattern of excessive force among local law enforcement.",
      "Sheriff Eric Balentine, who confirmed the FBI accepted his request to investigate, said his department \"exhausted all resources\" in its investigation.",
      "\"We feel confident in what our findings were, but we feel like by doing this we can give the family more peace of mind,\" Balentine said.",
      "A spokesperson for the FBI's field office in Birmingham confirmed the FBI is aware of Dennoriss Richardson's death and is reviewing the allegations of criminal misconduct.",
      "\"The FBI is aware of the tragic death of Dennoriss Richardson and takes allegations of federal law violations seriously,\" a spokesperson of the FBI's national office told CBS News.",
      "Tori Bailey, the president of the local NAACP chapter and the only Black member of the six-person county commission in Colbert County, said the community's reaction to Richardson's death was partially informed by the region's harrowing history with lynchings.",
      "In Alabama, there were 359 reported lynchings between 1877 and 1943, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform nonprofit. In Colbert County alone, there were 11.",
      "Bailey said, although there may be nothing to these accusations, it makes sense the community would have a \"visceral\" reaction to a Black man hanging and want a more thorough investigation. She said while some officers are trying to do the right thing, in her 12 years as NAACP president she has documented and investigated many cases of excessive force in the county.",
      "\"There has long been a kind of disconnect between communities of color and law enforcement. Unfortunately, many of us do not feel that law enforcement is actually there to serve and protect,\" Bailey said.",
      "In 2020, the death of Robert Fuller, a 24-year-old Black man\u00a0found hanging from a tree\u00a0in June in Palmdale, California, was ruled a suicide, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department\u00a0said. Police said that following an investigation, \"the medical examiner issued their final autopsy report and delivered it to the Sheriff's Department and deemed this case to be suicide.\"",
      "Marvin Long, a 57-year-old Black man and lifelong Colbert County resident, knew Dennoriss Richardson's family well growing up. He shares the skepticism about the suicide ruling and said Richardson's death has intensified his fear of retaliation.",
      "\"To this day I hate seeing a police car,\" Long said. \"I'm still more afraid now than ever.\"",
      "Long sued the Sheffield Police department last year. After he inquired about an unrelated arrest taking place just outside his property in 2021, body camera footage appears to show officers following Long to his house, dragging him down his porch steps and siccing the police K9 on him as he screams for help. Long was unarmed, according to the complaint.",
      "Richardson and Long are among five Black and Latino men represented by civil rights attorney Roderick Van Daniel who have filed lawsuits against the department in recent years.",
      "\"Citizens are living in fear of retaliation,\" Van Daniel said.",
      "In one case, an off-duty Sheffield police officer was caught on surveillance footage punching and pulling a gun on a Black man at a liquor store. The officer was later convicted of assault and menacing and reckless endangerment. He was fired from the department.",
      "In a separate lawsuit, a 57-year-old chiropractor claims he was shocked with a Taser 18 times while in handcuffs after he asked an officer to help him find his wife's iPhone. Photos included in the suit show several large burn marks allegedly from the assault.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not respond to numerous phone calls and emails seeking comment. Lawyers for the officers named in pending lawsuits did not respond to emails.",
      "Balentine, the sheriff since 2023, declined to comment on specific cases. But he said that based on his almost 30 years as an officer in the area, he thought residents in Colbert County generally trusted law enforcement.",
      "\"If it's proven that it was excessive, then I'm sure that there will be accountability,\" he said.",
      "Still, Balentine said he hoped the FBI investigation would help assuage concerns.",
      "\"Transparency is always a good way to mend some fences with the community,\" he said.",
      "Leigh Richardson had known her husband since he was 17. She remembers Dennoriss, known affectionately as \"Na-Na,\" as a warm father to their five children. But she also said his fear of the police was not new.",
      "\"He was scared at that young age,\" Richardson said.",
      "Richardson said that after filing the lawsuit her husband was frequently stopped by police. In those months, he was \"trying to stay out of the way,\" she said.",
      "Sheffield Mayor Steve Stanley said Dennoriss Richardson had come to his office at least once to express concerns that he was being profiled. Stanley said he assured Richardson that any officers reported through official channels would be investigated.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not confirm whether or how frequently the department pulled over Richardson.",
      "Court records show Dennoriss Richardson had a long history of run-ins with local law enforcement, but the majority of the charges in federal and state courts did not stick.",
      "Dennoriss Richardson pleaded guilty to drug possession in 2006 and was sentenced to five years in prison. In more than 15 years since then, court records show Richardson was arrested at least six additional times by the Sheffield Police Department, for charges ranging from disorderly conduct to robbery to assault.",
      "None of those charges, except for a traffic violation for expired tags, resulted in a conviction, according to available court records.",
      "In the same week that Richardson filed his lawsuit against the department, he was charged with trafficking meth. He had been arrested in a house where drugs allegedly were found. Richardson was out on bond when he died.",
      "Stanley said he firmly supports holding officers accountable for misconduct but emphasized his overwhelming confidence in them.",
      "\"I have preached and believe that the majority of officers, at least, recognize that everybody deserves respect,\" Stanley said.",
      "Still, amid the looming investigation, uncertainty in the community prevails.",
      "In early October, Richardson's friends and family filled the pews of the small Trinity Memorial Funeral Home to commemorate his life. The singing and sermons were punctuated by calls for justice.",
      "At the pulpit, Van Daniel, Richardson's attorney, said Richardson \"believed in transparency and accountability. He stood up against police misconduct.\"",
      "There was a steady chorus of \"amens\" from the crowd as Van Daniel spoke.",

    "title": "Some consumers say a kratom drink's marketing led to an addiction",
    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 10:00:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, said she became addicted to kratom drink \"Feel Free Classic,\" after she sought an alcohol alternative.",
    "story": [
      "When Jasmine Adeoye, an account manager based in Austin, Texas, decided to stop drinking in June 2022, she turned to a kratom beverage advertised as an alcohol alternative. Within a year and a half, Adeoye said she was addicted to the drink, \"Feel Free Classic,\" lured by what she calls the company's deceptive marketing tactics.",
      "The 29-year-old account manager based in Austin, Texas, said her favorite podcasters promoted the drink, which the company Botanic Tonics manufactures and sells, as \"a miracle\" beverage that could help people trying to overcome addiction and embrace sobriety. Having struggled with binge drinking in the past, Adeoye was intrigued.",
      "She said she was unaware the drink contained kratom, a plant native to Southeast Asia that can produce feelings of energy, ease anxiety and reduce pain\u2014 but carries a risk of addiction, seizures, and very rarely, death. Since kratom is unregulated in the U.S., some products are sold in highly concentrated forms and could contain contaminants like heavy metals and harmful bacteria, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.",
      "Eventually, Adeoye says she was drinking up to 10 two-ounce bottles a day and spending around $100 daily. The company recommends consumers drink no more than a bottle daily. By then, she said, her life revolved around the drink and she needed to make sure she had access to it wherever she went.",
      "A drink advertised an #alcoholalternative",
      "Then came the withdrawals, which some consumers compare on social media to withdrawing from an opioid.",
      "\"When I would wake up, I'd be 'dope sick', essentially, and need to go straight to the gas station and go buy Feel Free to immediately feel better,\" Adeoye said.",
      "This past March, after one bout of withdrawal symptoms was so severe, she sought medical care close to her home in Austin. She hadn't told the doctors she was struggling with kratom use, she said, and they chalked her symptoms up to a virus.",
      "\"All of a sudden, it just spirals out of control and you get to a point where you feel like you can't live without them,\" she said. \"And you become just a shell of a person.\"",
      "Adeoye, who was trying to stay sober from alcohol, said she unwittingly found herself in the throes of addiction \u2014 and she's not the only one.",
      "A forum on the social network Reddit called r/quittingkratom has more than 45,000 members while a forum dedicated exclusively to quitting Feel Free has nearly 3,000. There are podcasts, support groups and books dedicated to quitting kratom.",
      "In 2023, a class action lawsuit was filed in California against Botanic Tonics alleging that the drink was advertised as a safe alternative to alcohol. The company used social media to reach its \"desired customer base,\" the lawsuit states, which included individuals who had struggled with addiction. According to the 2023 suit, Botanic Tonics posted over a thousand advertisements on Instagram using the hashtag #alcoholalternative. The suit also says that advertisements on Instagram omitted any mention of kratom or potential side effects.",
      "CBS News spoke with another consumer about their experience with Feel Free Classic who also described the drink's appeal as an alcohol alternative, and said they had become addicted to the beverage and eventually experienced withdrawal symptoms.",
      "The company told CBS News in a statement it \"fell short of the high standards of transparency and consumer education that our company now champions.\" And they've taken steps for \"continuous improvement and doing what's right for consumers.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics said they'd implemented changes including enhanced labeling, raised age restrictions to 21 and over, investing in clinical research, expanded consumer education resources and maintained rigorous manufacturing standards in FDA-registered, cGMP-certified facilities.",
      "CBS News found through an internet search that Feel Free Classic was featured in at least 22 podcasts. The company's founder, JW Ross, has spoken openly with podcast hosts about his previous struggles with alcohol, and how Feel Free Classic was developed as an alternative.",
      "\"We make a powerful product. That product works for a lot of people, but it doesn't work for everyone,\" Botanic Tonics said in a statement to CBS News. \"Our priority as a company is making sure it gets into the right hands, which is why it's so important for us to focus on informing people who have issues with substance abuse that it isn't for them.\"",
      "Upon the lawsuit's settlement in September, Botanic Tonics said it would issue clear labels and warnings \u2014 but around the time Adeoye began taking Feel Free Classic and ultimately became hooked, the website advertised the drinks to be \"used for productivity enhancement or as a healthy alcohol alternative.\" As recently as January 2024, a banner on the website read \"cheers to a dry January.\"",
      "Kratom risks not fully known by the public",
      "Kratom is used by an estimated 2 million to 15 million Americans. As kratom's use rises in the U.S., so do the risks. The FDA warns the public against consuming kratom for medical use due to the risk of liver toxicity, seizures and substance use disorder; the DEA classifies it as a \"drug of concern\" and warns that it can lead to addiction. Botanic Tonics said, \"while leaf kratom can lead to physical dependence, its risk profile is significantly lower compared to many other commonly used substances.\" The company pointed CBS News to comparative safety practices and FDA studies available on the Global Kratom Coalition website, an advocacy group promoting the use of kratom.",
      "It is rare to overdose from kratom alone \u2013 a vast majority of the overdoses typically include an accompanying substance like alcohol or cocaine. But it does happen.",
      "Wrongful death suits in Florida, Georgia, Texas, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington followed. The family of a Florida woman whose death in 2021 was attributed to a chemical compound found in kratom was awarded $11 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. Last year, $2.5 million was awarded in the first kratom wrongful death trial in the United States. A kratom company based in Washington State was found liable for negligence among other claims relating to the death of a 39-year-old who was found dead in his living room after consuming kratom.",
      "Despite kratom's potential for addiction and subsequent withdrawal symptoms, it has gained a reputation among the online sobriety community as a method to self-manage opioid withdrawal \u2014 which has not yet been scientifically proven.",
      "Adeoye said even though information about the dangers of kratom was readily available, she didn't understand the associated risks. If she could go back two years, she said, she would have researched the ingredients \"as heavily as possible.\"",
      "\"To my knowledge, it was something that was similar to matcha, like a tea or a coffee,\" Adeoye said. \"So, thought it was completely harmless.\"",
      "Scrutiny grows around kratom marketing",
      "Botanic Tonics isn't the only kratom product company that has come under scrutiny.",
      "In July, the FDA issued a warning advising consumers against using OPMS Black Liquid Kratom, which \"has been linked to serious adverse health effects, including death,\" according to the agency. Shot of Joy, which sells kratom shots, was issued a warning letter by the FDA in 2023 stating the company markets their products for the \"treatment or cure of opioid addiction\"\u2014 a claim the FDA says has not been determined by the agency. In a series of Instagram advertisements viewed by CBS News, Shot of Joy promotes their beverage as an alcohol alternative. The FDA has issued warning letters to ten companies that sell kratom products between 2019 and 2023.",
      "After nearly two years of silently struggling, Adeoye told her mom, and then her husband following that medical visit. She was ready to quit.",
      "She spent the next few days detoxing at home.",
      "\"I couldn't eat anything. My mom had to force me to eat,\" she said, noting that she had to have someone with her \"around the clock.\"",
      "Though the physical withdrawals tapered off after about three days she says it took six months to feel regulated mentally.",
      "\"It's very depressing to feel this emptiness,\" Adeoye said of quitting kratom. \"You feel like life is never going to be the same.\"",
      "Botanic Tonics'\u00a0 FAQ page now includes a section addressing past marketing practices.",
      "\"Our marketing strategy has changed dramatically in the past year, but not as a reaction to the lawsuit filing,\" the statement reads. \"As our business has grown, specifically in retail, we've shifted marketing focus accordingly.\"",

      "Berkshire said it sold off more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The stake valued at $69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth $174.3 billion.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealized paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per Class A share.",
      "Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire's operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire's bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's $10.8 billion, or $7,437.15 per Class A share.",

    "summary": "Laws in more than 20 states, including Louisiana, now restrict various elements of mail-in ballots, which includes the kinds of assistance a voter can ask for.",
    "story": [
      "New laws aimed at protecting the 2024 presidential election from fears about fraud are creating unexpected barriers for some of the nation's more than 40.2 million voters with disabilities, disability rights advocates have told CBS News.",
      "Laws in more than 20 states now restrict various elements of mail-in ballots including limiting the kinds of assistance a voter can ask for. Restrictions like those limit the ability of health aides and nurses to help prepare a ballot for the people they care for \u2013 and some even threaten criminal charges for aides who help too many people to vote.",
      "\"If I owned a nursing home or a group home, I [would] put out a memo to my staff saying, 'don't help anybody out because if you end up helping two people out by mistake, you could, could go to jail,'\" said Andrew Bizer, a disability rights attorney in New Orleans. \"And it also puts the folks with disabilities in a really terrible situation.\"",
      "Many of the new laws came after the 2020 elections when former President Donald Trump questioned the security of mail-in voting.",
      "A new study released by the Rutgers Program for Disability Research found that there has been a 5.1% increase in people with disabilities eligible to vote in 2020. Among that growing population, 7.1 million eligible voters with disabilities live in seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. This shows the potential impacts that restrictive mail-in voting laws could have in next week's election.",
      "One state confronting this problem is Louisiana. In late May, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a series of laws aimed at increasing the state's \"election integrity.\" The laws were first championed by Louisiana Secretary of State Nancy Landry who called them \"a boost\" to the state's election protection efforts. She pledged those efforts would \"bring us closer to being ranked first in the nation for election integrity.\"",
      "One of the laws signed by the governor makes it illegal in the state to assist more than one person with filling out, mailing or witnessing an absentee ballot \u2013 unless those being helped are immediate family members. That new restriction places caregivers and those who work at nursing, assisted living or group home facilities at risk of criminal charges if they help too many people with their ballots.",
      "Ashley Volion, a policy analyst with Disability Rights Louisiana who has spastic cerebral palsy and has difficulty with mobility, said she relies heavily on a personal care attendant to assist her with daily tasks.",
      "\"I honestly don't know what I would do, because they help me live my life as independently and as inclusive in the community as possible,\" Volion told CBS News.",
      "Volion said both her parents live an hour away from her and are getting older.",
      "\"They can't help me out as much physically as they once did or could do,\" she said, leaving her to solely rely on her caregivers to assist her.",
      "Volion is one of 1.1 million voters with disabilities living in Louisiana. It is unclear how many of them rely on aides to assist them with some aspects of their ballot, whether that is to act as a witness or help return their ballot.",
      "For those residing in a nursing home, federal and state protections ensure that they can receive assistance in the form of a visit from their registrar of voters. The task of helping more than 22,000 Louisianians who reside in a nursing home has fallen to the parish Registrars of Voters.",
      "CBS News spoke with one woman who works at Convent Nursing Home in New Orleans. In past years, Elizabeth Ellis was one of the few people able to assist residents at the nursing home with their mail-in ballots and was prepared to do the same this year before a concerned family member called.",
      "\"She was the first person to come to me and say, 'I know that this law is a thing,'\" Ellis said. \"I know that y'all are going to have to sign and you can't sign for more than one person.\"",
      "Not aware of the new laws, Ellis said she jumped into action to try and pull together enough people to help residents. Some 20% of the residents at Covenant Nursing Home do not have family available to help them, and for even those who do have family nearby, it can be a challenge getting them there to help.",
      "\"How are we gonna do this? Because I have a hard time sometimes getting families to be involved in their loved ones' care,\" Ellis told CBS News.",
      "She was able to get local assistance for her nursing home. Two weeks ago the Parish Registrar of Voters visited Covenant Nursing Home and assisted some of the residents with their mail-in ballots. Walking away from the experience, many residents proudly wore their 'I Voted' stickers.",
      "Ellis said the visit was more than just making sure her residents cast their ballots.",
      "\"For those who are already feeling forgotten, are already feeling that they don't count. To now not have their votes count either. It's just an added level of hardship to them that shouldn't happen,\" Ellis said.",
      "According to Ellis, this was the first time the registrar had visited the nursing home to assist since before Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",
      "However, assisted living and other long-term care facilities are not eligible for this service under Louisiana law and remain at risk of not having enough staff to assist residents with their ballots. CBS News found that there are more than 1,300 long-term care facilities across the state that would need to find another way to get assistance and lean on family members to come out and assist. CBS News reached out to several of them to ask about their experiences, but none of them were willing to speak out publicly.",
      "For Bizer, the laws cross a line, breaking federal law.",
      "\"The Voting Rights Act says that someone with the disability has the right to choose whoever they want to assist them,\" Bizer said. \"This restricts that, and it makes the person who helps them, if they help more than one person, that person can go to jail.\" Bizer is representing Volion and Disability Rights Louisiana in a lawsuit against the Louisiana secretary of state and attorney general.",
      "Louisiana Secretary of State Landry defended the laws before the state legislature earlier this year, saying they would prevent \"ballot harvesting the collection and delivery of mass absentee ballots.\" She argued the practice could be \"dangerous to voters and an affront to voters and election integrity.\"",

Moore went into the store unarmed, took a gun from the victim when it was pointed at him and fatally shot him in the chest as the victim shot him with a second gun in the arm.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers asked Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life in prison without parole because of his spotless prison record and willingness to be a mentor to other inmates. They also said it would be unjust to execute someone for what could be considered self-defense and unfair that Moore, who is Black, was the only inmate on the state\u2019s death row convicted by a jury without any African Americans.",

Then he took some shallow breaths until about 6:04, when his breathing stopped. Moore showed no obvious signs of discomfort.",

They were joined by a former state prison director, Moore's trial judge, his son and daughter, a half-dozen childhood friends and several pastors.",
      "They all said Moore, 59, was a changed man who loved God, doted on his new grandchildren the best he could, helped guards keep the peace and mentored other prisoners after his addiction to drugs clouded his judgment and led to the shootout in which James Mahoney was killed, according to the clemency petition.",
      "Moore previously had two execution dates postponed as the state sorted through issues that created a 13-year pause in the death penalty, including companies' refusal to sell the state lethal injection drugs, a hurdle that was solved by passing a secrecy law.",

      "\"Clemency is a matter of grace, a matter of mercy. There is no standard. There is no real law on it,\" McMaster told reporters Thursday.",

      "\"This is definitely part of my life I wish I could change. I took a life. I took someone\u2019s life. I broke the family of the deceased,\" Moore said. \"I pray for the forgiveness of that particular family.\"",

      "The woman, who asked not to be identified amid fears of retaliation from the billionaire mogul, told Fox News Digital she and a friend chatted up a security guard at a Hammerstein Ballroom concert on April 22, 2011, and got to meet the performer before he stepped in front of the crowd.",

      "\"We're investigating and potentially going to bring action,\" Macedonio told Fox News Digital. \"We are in the process of obtaining any and all police and medical records and interviewing witnesses.\"",
      "Her harrowing story was corroborated by her mother, who said she met her at the hospital in the aftermath of the alleged drugging, but police said they could not find records of the incident.",
      "\"One of the girls I was close with was talking to (Combs') security guard, and she got us backstage to speak to him and hang out,\" the accuser told Fox News Digital. \"We went down to this room that was covered in balloons and Ciroc from one wall to the other.\"",
      "\"It taught me a lesson \u2014 now I cover my drinks everywhere I go and drink out of the bottle.\"",
      "She provided photos from the night in question that share some similarities with archive images taken of Combs on stage during that performance. He has the same haircut and goatee and appears to be wearing the same sunglasses and necklace.",
      "The accuser remembers being taken to the side of the stage, behind the curtain, where people were handing out vodka drinks.",
      "\"They handed us a drink, and literally that's all I remember,\" she said. \"I heard music, loud noise just coming from the stage, and then don't remember anything else after that.\"",

      "Tests found the presence of date rape drugs in her system, she said, but no signs of penetration.",
      "The woman said she found a bunch of unfamiliar numbers added to her phone and tried reaching out to piece together what happened. She called one and a man answered and invited her to Atlantic City, she said. Another picked up, gaslit her and hung up.",

    "summary": "The blistering remarks come after HuffPost first revealed that Tim Sheehy accused wildland firefighters of laziness and \u201cmilking\u201d fires for overtime pay.",
    "story": [
      "A union representing thousands of federal wildland firefighters excoriated Montana GOP Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy after he accused firefighters of dragging their feet to put out infernos and \u201cmilking\u201d disasters for overtime pay.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s comments are not only unfounded and disrespectful of wildland firefighters across the country, but they also show a severe lack of understanding of the essential and dangerous work these brave men and women do to defend our country from devastating fires \u2013 especially communities in Montana,\u201d said Randy Erwin, the national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, in a press release dated Thursday.",
      "\u201cSheehy\u2019s disdain for firefighters is out of step with true Montanans and the rest of America,\u201d he added.",
      "Erwin\u2019s blistering takedown comes about two weeks after HuffPost first reported that Sheehy, who made millions running an aerial firefighting company that relies heavily on lucrative federal contracts, has repeatedly claimed, with little evidence, that a significant number of boots-on-the-ground firefighters are standing around while wildfires rage.",
      "In the 2023 book \u201cMudslingers: A True Story of Aerial Firefighting,\u201d Sheehy described an encounter with firefighters battling blazes in Idaho in 2015. He wrote that one firefighting pilot told him of the blaze: \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to go too fast. ... There\u2019s a lot of overtime pay to be earned out there! We put it out, it\u2019s back on salary!\u2019\u201d",
      "That conversation \u201csmacked less of concern or common sense than it did laziness \u2014 or, worse, greed,\u201d Sheehy wrote. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it malevolence; anyone who climbs into a plane or picks up a shovel to fight wildfires clearly has a capacity for goodness and a desire to help. That said, even in positions that are demonstrably service-oriented, there is the potential for self-interest, if not outright corruption, leading to a response that is not necessarily in the public\u2019s best interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is no fire, there is no money,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the faster that a fire is extinguished, the sooner the money dries up or goes elsewhere. It might seem ridiculous to worry about a shortage of work to keep the wildfire industry busy given the extraordinary expansion of the season in recent years, not to mention the gnawing sense that firefighters will forever be overmatched against nature. But old beliefs and protocols die hard, and clearly there were some in the industry who saw nothing wrong with milking every fire for what it was worth despite the risks and the blurring of ethical boundaries.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not the only time Sheehy has hurled such accusations at public servants who work in the same field as him. Sheehy is the founder of Belgrade, Montana-based Bridger Aerospace, a company that has a fleet of firefighting aircraft, and he has consistently highlighted his company\u2019s work in campaign ads and speeches. At a book signing in Huntsville, Alabama, in April, months after launching his campaign against three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, Sheehy told attendees, \u201cThere\u2019s a very real dynamic in wildfire that a lot of those people don\u2019t want to put the fire out.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to put the fire out because that\u2019s where they get their overtime, that\u2019s where they get their hazard pay,\u201d he added.",
      "Wildland firefighters are notoriously underpaid for a job that is becoming increasingly dangerous amid worsening climate change.",
      "In an October post on X, formerly Twitter, Tester called Sheehy\u2019s comments \u201cinsulting.\u201d",
      "On its website, the National Federation of Federal Employees notes that its advocacy for wildland firefighters includes \u201cfighting for a permanent, competitive pay fix, enhanced mental health and physical wellbeing resources, adequate housing, and more.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s press release, Erwin said that NFFE represents many federal wildland firefighters across the country, including in Montana. And he highlighted the myriad challenges these workers are facing.",
      "\u201cWildland firefighters have been doing more with less for decades, and the current shortage of firefighters places them and other first responders at greater risk while they work longer deployments fighting hotter and bigger fires each year,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSheehy and his arial company have profited heavily from taxpayer-funded contracts to fight wildfires while many wildland firefighters struggle to pay the rent because of low pay.\u201d",
      "He slammed Sheehy\u2019s remarks as \u201celitist and self-serving.\u201d",
      "\u201cFederal wildland firefighters and other first responders deserve better, as do all the residents of Montana,\u201d Erwin said.",

      "On Friday, the DEC and Chemung County Department of Health confirmed both animals\u2019 fate.",

In addition, a person involved with the investigation was bitten by the squirrel.

    "story": [
      "VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico \u2014 Eliezer Concepci\u00f3n worked for years at his roadside mechanic shop to save enough money to buy a piece of his hometown before it was too late.",
      "In 2020, he finally purchased a dilapidated house in this beachside enclave roughly 45 minutes west of the sprawling capital of San Juan. It took him two years to renovate a dwelling destroyed in 2017\u2019s Hurricane Mar\u00eda into a functioning Airbnb. But he saw it as a way to earn extra money by tapping into the Caribbean island\u2019s $10 billion tourism industry \u2014 and to keep the cash circulating locally.",
      "For years, Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial tax haven laws have drawn wealthy Americans looking to avoid income taxes and sparked a property gold rush that pits lower-paid, Spanish-speaking natives against cash-rich Anglophone newcomers. But Concepci\u00f3n, 43, was determined to keep at least his piece of the town in the hands of a real Vegabaje\u00f1o.",
      "\u201cMy neighbors are all selling,\u201d Concepci\u00f3n, 43, said on a July afternoon, leaning back in the leather chair of the tiny office of his auto body shop. \u201cBut I wanted a good chance for someone from here to buy and rebuild.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s getting harder to reject the routine cash offers from real estate speculators. Since the privately held LUMA Energy took over operations of Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical grid from the bankrupt state-owned utility PREPA in 2021, the power goes out weekly, if not daily, and bills keep going up. A lack of consistent air conditioning or refrigeration deters guests, leaving Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s vacation rental business struggling. He wonders how long he can hold out \u2014 and how Puerto Rico\u2019s historic election next week could forever change the dynamics in what is considered the world\u2019s oldest colony.",
      "While they are full U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans living on the island can\u2019t vote for the president, and the lone delegate they send to Congress has no real legislative powers. That makes the gubernatorial race the territory\u2019s most important election \u2014 and this year\u2019s is unlike any other in the 76 years since the U.S. began allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their own governor.",
      "That\u2019s because, when Concepci\u00f3n goes to the polls next week, he\u2019ll be among the first American citizens since the Civil War with a real shot at electing a governor from a party pushing for independence from the United States.",
      "Juan Dalmau, the gubernatorial nominee from the once-marginalized Puerto Rican Independence Party, is now in second place, and polls show the race tightening amid the island\u2019s fury over remarks a speaker made last Sunday at former President Donald Trump\u2019s rally in Manhattan calling Puerto Rico a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "The front-runner, Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, is a Republican and Trump ally representing the New Progressive Party, the pro-statehood party that has ruled Puerto Rico continuously since 2016.",
      "Jes\u00fas Manuel Ortiz Gonz\u00e1lez, the nominee from the traditional opposition Popular Democratic Party, which advocates retaining Puerto Rico\u2019s territorial status, struggled to break through but is now competing with Dalmau for second place in the most recent poll.",
      "The Fraught History That Led To This Point",
      "The central faultline in Puerto Rican politics has long been the territory\u2019s relationship with the mainland U.S. After seizing the island as a colony in the spoils of Washington\u2019s victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the U.S. violently suppressed Puerto Rico\u2019s independence movement for decades.",
      "As Europe began dismantling its empires after World War II, the U.S. granted the Philippines its independence but cut a separate deal with Puerto Rico, giving the island limited autonomy as a \u201ccommonwealth\u201d and U.S. territory.",
      "Puerto Rican rebels, under the command of the Harvard-trained lawyer and independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos, attempted an armed uprising in 1950. But the U.S. military, in a singular act of deploying the Air Force against its own citizens, bombed a rebel stronghold in the mountains, leveling almost the entire town. Even waving a pro-independence flag became an offense punished with years of jail time.",
      "From that point on, local control of Puerto Rico passed between the two main political parties duking it out each election cycle. On one side was the Popular Democratic Party, known by its Spanish acronym PPD, which supported the commonwealth status quo. On the other was the New Progressive Party, or PNP, which called for U.S. statehood. The pro-independence PIP remained a minor third party akin to the Green Party, earning at most a tiny single-digit percentage of the vote each election.",
      "That arrangement worked for much of the rest of the 20th century, when federal support helped industrialize Puerto Rico and raise living standards. In 1996, however, Clinton-era reforms saw the federal government phase out the tax credit that had drawn manufacturers to the island. As factories closed, Puerto Rico\u2019s government tried to make up for the jobs by hiring more teachers and police officers. But as the industrial tax base evaporated, Puerto Rico borrowed more and more money by issuing bonds that Wall Street expected would be backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury.",
      "By 2016, Puerto Rico\u2019s debt and unfunded pension obligations reached a combined $126 billion. The island went bankrupt.",
      "Not an independent country, Puerto Rico could not get help refinancing from international lenders. Not a fully incorporated part of the U.S., either, the territory could not access the bankruptcy protections from which states and municipalities like Detroit benefit.",
      "Instead, Congress \u2014 which legally considers Puerto Rico and the four other permanently populated U.S. territories \u201cpossessions\u201d \u2014 passed a law called the PROMESA Act, after the Spanish word for \u201cpromise,\u201d which gave a White House-appointed board of financial overseers veto power over all the spending of the island\u2019s elected government.",
      "The fiscal control board \u2014 known pejoratively among locals as \u201cla junta,\u201d the term for a ruling council in military dictatorships \u2014 instituted harsh austerity measures, closing hundreds of schools and slashing pensions in a place with worse poverty than the poorest U.S. state.",
      "Then came Hurricane Mar\u00eda, a catastrophe from which Puerto Rico\u2019s infrastructure has yet to recover. While the precise death toll is debated, most scholars agree the aftermath of the storm killed thousands who might have otherwise survived if they had had access to refrigerated medicine or clean water after the blackout disabled groundwater pumps.",
      "In the summer of 2019, text messages between then-Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and his inner circle showed the pro-statehood leader making jokes about the bloated bodies of Puerto Ricans killed during the storm two years earlier. As many as 1 million Puerto Ricans flooded the streets in protest, demanding his resignation.",
      "The chaos didn\u2019t stop when Rossell\u00f3 stepped down in disgrace. He tried appointing Pedro Pierluisi, a former coal lobbyist, as governor. But state courts intervened and instead selected Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced to lead the island from 2019 to 2021 (Pierluisi then won the 2020 election to succeed her, and is the island\u2019s current governor). In 2022, just as protests over the LUMA contract were growing, federal authorities arrested V\u00e1zquez in a corruption scandal.",
      "To Dalmau, the events showed Puerto Rico was primed for radical change. Sure enough, when he ran for governor in 2020, he won 14% of the vote \u2014 seven times the largest share of ballots the Independence Party had ever won and the first time it had earned a double-digit share of the vote.",
      "How A \u2018Radical\u2019 Candidate Went Mainstream",
      "Like Albizu Campos, Juan Manuel Dalmau Ram\u00edrez is a Harvard-trained lawyer. Dalmau, 51, served in Puerto Rico\u2019s Senate before becoming the standard-bearer for the Puerto Rican Independence Party, or PIP, in the 2020 election.",
      "His surprisingly strong performance wasn\u2019t the only sign the two-party duopoly on Puerto Rico\u2019s politics was crumbling. That same year saw upstart parties that eschewed the status question field competitive nominees.",
      "On the right, the Christian-democratic Dignity Project party sought to unite the largely Catholic island around conservative social reforms, like tighter abortion restrictions and a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. On the left, the Citizens Victory Movement endorsed more liberal social policies but advocated primarily for ending Puerto Rico\u2019s colonial arrangement with the U.S. In a bid to cleave voters from both traditional parties, neither new party openly backed statehood or independence.",
      "In 2020, the Citizens Victory Movement came close to winning the race for San Juan mayor, arguably the island\u2019s second-most influential position after governor. This year, the Independence Party and the Citizens Victory Movement formed a coalition called Alianza, or \u201cAlliance.\u201d",
      "The Citizens Victory Movement\u2019s energetic organizing, combined with the Independence Party\u2019s experience running in elections for decades, has launched Dalmau into second place in recent polls.",
      "Dalmau\u2019s pitch for breaking off from the U.S. is really something closer to a conscious uncoupling. He envisions weaning Puerto Rico off federal funding over a 25-year period and striking a deal to give members of the Puerto Rican diaspora \u2014 twice as many Puerto Ricans live in states like New York and Florida as on the island \u2014 the option for dual passports.",
      "The recently privatized power grid will need to come back under government management, but Dalmau wants to attract big companies with tax breaks like the ones the U.S. government once used to develop a manufacturing industry in Puerto Rico.",
      "\u201cOur platform is going to support a democratic decolonization process,\u201d Dalmau told HuffPost in July after a press conference at a landmark building in the upscale San Juan neighborhood of Miramar. \u201cPuerto Ricans are a nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent.\u201d",
      "During the world wars, the U.S. military\u2019s outposts in Puerto Rico helped Washington maintain control over the Caribbean and routes to the Panama Canal. During the Cold War, Puerto Rico served as a vital defense hub and a model for the benefits of American capitalism over communism once Fidel Castro took power in neighboring Cuba.",
      "But now, Dalmau said, Puerto Rico no longer hosts major military operations, and its debt crisis is an ongoing embarrassment to the U.S.",
      "\u201cPuerto Rico has become a burden,\u201d he said.",
      "Puerto Ricans are split over the island\u2019s future relationship with the U.S. A survey released last month by El Nuevo D\u00eda, the territory\u2019s newspaper of record, showed 44% of voters back statehood and a combined 44% favor sovereignty. Of the latter set, 25% support a compact of free association with the U.S. \u2014 a deal akin to what Palau and Micronesia have, allowing the former U.S. Pacific territories to represent themselves at the United Nations but still benefit from federal funding \u2014 and 19% back independence.",
      "Either way, Dalmau has sought to play down the independence issue, particularly as voters prepare to cast ballots simultaneously in a nonbinding referendum over whether Puerto Rico should become a state, independent or something else. For the first time in the long history of failed plebiscites over Puerto Rico\u2019s status, where one side or the other often boycotted the vote to make the results meaningless, this referendum does not include the option for the status quo.",
      "Rather than peg his candidacy to independence, Dalmau has pitched himself as a crusader against what he called the \u201ctwo-headed monster\u201d of the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cPeople lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent,\u201d Dalmau said. \u201cPeople tell me, \u2018I was PNP, I was PPD, we have to get these people out of office.\u2019\u201d",
      "The MAGA Front-Runner",
      "Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, who leads the gubernatorial race, has sought to revive old fears of independence by linking Dalmau to socialist authoritarians in Latin America. Ads running on TV show him alongside Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, Cuban leader Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel and Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega.",
      "Ironically, it\u2019s her party, the pro-statehood PNP, that has the closest connections to Venezuela\u2019s embattled regime.",
      "As part of a massive corruption investigation, federal authorities arrested the former PNP governor, V\u00e1zquez, in 2022 on bribery charges. Among those charged with her was Julio Martin Herrera Velutini, a banker who financed her failed election campaign in 2020. The Department of Justice accused Herrera Velutini of bribing V\u00e1zquez as part of a deal to take control of Puerto Rico\u2019s financial regulator to hide a multimillion-dollar portfolio of dirty money linked to the Venezuelan regime.",
      "Like Dalmau, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n \u2014 who currently serves as Puerto Rico\u2019s resident commissioner, a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. Congress \u2014 ran on changing the contract between the island and LUMA Energy after it took over the territory\u2019s electrical grid three years ago under a privatization effort the fiscal control board promoted.",
      "Her tough-talking ads on radio and television helped her defeat incumbent governor Pierluisi in the PNP\u2019s primary earlier this year.",
      "A spokesperson for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n declined HuffPost\u2019s request to meet in Puerto Rico over the summer and initially offered to set up an interview remotely a week later. But multiple subsequent emails and phone calls went unanswered.",
      "On the campaign trail, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n has claimed credit for the increase in federal funding the Biden administration has provided to Puerto Rico, and promised to hold LUMA accountable for ongoing blackouts. But Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a Republican in her stateside politics and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, was among the strongest supporters of privatizing Puerto Rico\u2019s electrical system. While the Biden administration has promoted solar energy, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n joined her fellow Republicans in advocating for Puerto Rico\u2019s controversial natural gas buildout.",
      "\u201cI see her as arrogant. She talks tough,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Rosario Borres, 53, a retired school janitor from the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel. \u201cShe kept lying and lying. It\u2019s written in black and white history. When you lie to Puerto Ricans, you disrespect us and underestimate our intelligence.\u201d",
      "Rosario Borres, who depends on an electric wheelchair due to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, said he needed cheaper, more reliable power. On a July afternoon, he came to an evangelical church in Santa Isabel to see U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm unveil a new program to provide solar panels to low-income households.",
      "He said he voted for Pierluisi in the primary. Now, he said, he may not vote at all. If he does, he said, his vote may go to Dalmau.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Juan than the PPD,\u201d he said, referring to the status-quo commonwealth party that served as the statehood party\u2019s traditional opposition.",
      "In Cata\u00f1o, a densely populated city neighborhood across the bay from scenic Old San Juan, Lissette Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos, a nun and environmentalist, criticized Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n\u2019s support for fossil fuel projects, including a controversial natural gas import terminal operating with federal permits.",
      "\u201cShe was pushing for more natural gas as the resident commissioner all while she was planning a run for governor,\u201d Avil\u00e9s R\u00edos said.",
      "Back in Vega Baja, Angel Manuel Ciordia, 75, said he would vote for Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n because he believes statehood is the best path forward for Puerto Rico. But he said it\u2019s unlikely to make any difference if Trump wins back the White House.",
      "\u201cIt all depends on who the president is,\u201d said Ciordia, a retired radio executive, during an interview outside his home. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t want us.\u201d",
      "Historically, Republicans championed statehood for Puerto Rico. In recent years, however, liberals have seized on the issue, conflating the movement with the push to admit the District of Columbia as its own state. The GOP has dismissed the effort as a bid to inflate Democratic power in the Senate, since D.C. is a liberal stronghold, though there\u2019s little evidence to suggest that socially conservative Puerto Rico would yield similar partisan outcomes.",
      "Recent GOP rhetoric suggesting Puerto Rican statehood would yield two liberal senators appears to have taken hold among voters. A YouGov poll released Thursday showed 79% of Democrats and just 41% of Republicans supporting statehood. Asked whether they would back Puerto Rico\u2019s independence, Democratic support plunged to 56%, while Republican backing rose slightly to 46%.",
      "Overall, however, 59% of Americans said they would support admitting Puerto Rico as a state if that\u2019s what voters on the island wanted. Just 16% opposed statehood, and 25% said they did not know enough to answer.",
      "Some voters themselves seemed to shrug off the sovereignty stakes of the election.",
      "\u201cI just want the government to help fishermen,\u201d Miguel Santiago said outside a bar on Vega Baja\u2019s main beach.",
      "He didn\u2019t have strong opinions about either top gubernatorial candidate but said the effects of climate change are shrinking the fish populations, and those whose livelihoods depend on large catches need the government to provide more subsidies and curbs on imported seafood.",
      "William Gibson, 60, a retired teacher sunbathing on the beach, said he had decamped permanently for Colombia. But he rolled his eyes when asked about Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and said he would not cast a ballot for her.",
      "In July, Concepci\u00f3n worried that Dalmau could not possibly compete with the well-funded campaigns from the traditional two parties.",
      "\u201cDalmau has a good message, but that isn\u2019t what people see,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey hear radio ads. They see TV ads. They get what the people with money to pay for them want us to see. And that\u2019s not the Independence Party.\u201d",
      "He hadn\u2019t yet decided how he would vote. But he said Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n was \u201csmart and more in touch with the people\u201d than the incumbent from her party, Pierluisi, and he was leaning toward voting for her.",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve seen her with friends of mine, regular people,\u201d he said. He grew quiet for a moment, then exhaled. \u201cShe at least looks like someone who can listen to people.\u201d",
      "Since then, however, Dalmau has racked up endorsements from some of Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest celebrities, including the music superstars Bad Bunny and Residente, and scored major interviews with influential local reporters.",
      "Meanwhile, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe\u2019s \u201cgarbage\u201d remark at Trump\u2019s rally went viral, stirring voters\u2019 resentments of Trump for his mishandling of the 2017 hurricane and redrawing the connection between Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n and the presidential candidate she supports. At the high school that one of Concepci\u00f3n\u2019s four children attends, Dalmau won students\u2019 mock election.",

      "\u201cThis is the most unfair election ad I have ever been a part of,\u201d he told Capehart and another Post writer, Ruth Marcus. \u201cYou guys are working. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m done.\u201d",
      "Hewitt\u2019s reaction arrived after Capehart suggested Trump was \u201claying the groundwork for contesting\u201d this year\u2019s vote results, following the GOP presidential nominee\u2019s recent claim that there had been \u201ccheating\u201d in Pennsylvania.",
      "Hewitt, who said that he voted for Trump last month, interrupted Marcus as she predicted the former president would \u201crev up his supporters to contest elections\u201d and also go to court to make \u201cwhatever arguments he can, no matter how far-fetched.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are news people, even though we have opinions, and we have to report the whole story if we bring up part of the story,\u201d Hewitt said.",
      "\u201cYes, he\u2019s upset about [Pennsylvania\u2019s] Bucks County, but he was right and he won in court,\u201d Hewitt said of Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s the story.\u201d",

      "That response led to Hewitt\u2019s meltdown, and the program subsequently experienced technical difficulties before Capehart brought it to a close.",

    "story": [
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 A federal jury on Friday convicted a former Kentucky police detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during a botched 2020 drug raid that left her dead.",
      "The 12-member jury returned the late-night verdict after clearing Brett Hankison earlier in the evening on a charge that he used excessive force on Taylor\u2019s neighbors.",
      "It was the first conviction of a Louisville police officer who was involved in the deadly raid.",
      "Some members of the jury were in tears as the verdict was read around 9:30 p.m. They had earlier indicated to the judge in two separate messages that they were deadlocked on the charge of using excessive force on Taylor, but chose to continue deliberating. The six man, six woman jury deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days.",
      "Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict with friends outside the federal courthouse, saying: \u201cIt took a lot of time. It took a lot of patience. It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.\u201d",
      "Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor\u2019s glass door and windows during the raid, but didn\u2019t hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor\u2019s adjoining apartment.",
      "The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked racial injustice protests nationwide.",
      "Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., called the verdict \u201ca long-awaited moment of accountability.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile it cannot restore Breonna to her family, it represents a crucial step in the pursuit of justice and a reminder that no one should be above the law,\u201d King said in a social media post Friday night.",
      "A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison last year, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022.",
      "The conviction against Hankison carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on March 12 by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings.",
      "Hankison, 48, argued throughout the trial that he was acting to protect his fellow officers after Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on them when they broke down Taylor\u2019s door with a battering ram.",
      "This jury sent a note on Thursday to the judge asking whether they needed to know if Taylor was alive as Hankison fired his shots.",
      "That was a point of contention during closing arguments, when Hankison\u2019s attorney Don Malarcik told the jury that prosecutors must \u201cprove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Taylor was alive\u201d when Hankison fired.",
      "After the jury sent the question, Jennings urged them to keep deliberating.",
      "Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Hankison testified that when Walker fired, he moved away, rounded the corner of the apartment unit and fired into Taylor\u2019s glass door and a window.",
      "Meanwhile, officers at the door returned Walker\u2019s fire, hitting and killing Taylor, who was in a hallway.",
      "Hankison\u2019s lawyers argued during closing statements Wednesday that Hankison was acting properly \u201cin a very tense, very chaotic environment\u201d that lasted about 12 seconds. They emphasized that Hankison\u2019s shots didn\u2019t hit anyone.",
      "Hankison was one of four officers charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 with violating Taylor\u2019s civil rights. Hankison\u2019s verdict is the second conviction from those cases. The first was a plea deal from a former officer who was not at the raid and became a cooperating witness in another case.",
      "Malarcik, Hankison\u2019s attorney, spoke at length during closing arguments about the role of Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, who fired the shot that hit former Sgt. John Mattingly at the door. He said Walker never tried to come to the door or turn the lights on as police were knocking and instead armed himself and hid in the dark.",
      "\u201cBrett Hankison was 12 inches away from being shot by Kenneth Walker,\u201d Malarcik said.",
      "Prosecutors said Hankison acted recklessly, firing 10 shots into doors and a window where he couldn\u2019t see a target.",

    "summary": "Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said DNA on a beer can at the campsite where Dustin Kjersem was killed led authorities to Daren Christopher Abbey.",
    "story": [
      "A Montana man accused of killing a camper in a brutal attack initially believed to have been caused by a bear has been arrested, Gallatin County officials said Thursday at a news conference.",
      "Daren Christopher Abbey, 41, was charged with deliberate homicide in the killing of Dustin Kjersem, 35, who was found dead inside his tent near Big Sky on Oct. 12 by his girlfriend, officials said. It was not immediately clear if Abbey had an attorney representing him.",
      "Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said Kjersem had planned a weekend camping trip with his girlfriend and arrived early on Oct.10 to set up the campsite. He was supposed to pick her up the following day after she finished working, but he did not show up.",
      "Springer said Kjersem\u2019s girlfriend went to the campsite on Oct.12 with a friend and found him dead inside his tent.",
      "In an earlier news release by the sheriff\u2019s office, authorities said that because of the viciousness of the attack, the caller who reported Kjersem dead said it may have been caused by a bear. However, there were no signs of bear activity at the campsite, and an autopsy determined Kjersem\u2019s death was a homicide.",
      "During the course of the investigation, detectives collected DNA evidence from a beer can at the scene, which led them to Abbey, Springer said.",
      "Abbey was taken into custody in Butte on an unrelated charge on Saturday, and he allegedly confessed to killing Kjersem on Tuesday. Springer said Abbey had been employed in the Big Sky area at different times. Booking records note his tattoos include a swastika, an iron cross and SS lightning bolts.",
      "According to Springer, Abbey told investigators he was looking for a place to camp on Oct.10 when he ran into Kjersem, who welcomed him to the campsite and offered him a beer.",

      "However, at some point during the interaction, Abbey struck Kjersem with a piece of solid wood, stabbed him in the neck with a screwdriver and attacked him with an ax, Springer said. Abbey reportedly removed items from the campsite that he believed would link him to the killing.",
      "Springer said the investigation could take months, adding that authorities are unsure if what Abbey has told them is completely accurate.",
      "\u201cWe have a bit of his story, but we don\u2019t really know what the true story is,\u201d Springer said.",

    "title": "Biden Says 'Not A Single, Solitary Republican' Helped Him And Harris Save Workers' Pensions",
    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 18:33:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The president visited the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania to talk about Democrats' pension rescue and how it's helping retirees.",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden reminded Pennsylvanians on Friday that he, Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats safeguarded more than 1 million people\u2019s pensions without any help from the GOP.",
      "Visiting a union hall in Philadelphia, Biden and local union leaders highlighted the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and how it funded union pension plans that were facing insolvency. The pensions of an estimated 1.2 million workers and retirees have been protected from cuts due to the legislation.",
      "It was no accident that the event took place in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most critical of battleground states for Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and for her opponent, former President Donald Trump. Democrats have worried about Harris\u2019 strength with the kind of blue-collar union voters whose pensions were backstopped by the bill.",
      "Biden made sure anyone listening knew that the pension rescue got no Republican backing when Democrats muscled it through Congress over three years ago as part of a larger, pandemic-era stimulus package. It passed on a party-line vote in the Senate, with Harris casting a tie-breaker at a critical juncture for the bill.",
      "The president said the vote underscored the hyperpartisan nature of Congress these days.",
      "\u201cWe used to have real differences in the Senate. But at least when the critical things, we ended up getting together. But not anymore,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis is a different deal we\u2019re working with. Not a single, solitary Republican in the House or the Senate, not one, voted to help with the pensions. Not one single one.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the way things have gotten,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d",
      "He said that he and Harris \u201cworked like hell\u201d to include the pension rescue, known as the Butch Lewis Act, as part of the American Rescue Plan, and theorized that some Republicans would have voted for it but were afraid to cross party leaders.",
      "\u201cI believe a lot of those Republicans who voted no thought it was wrong. But they\u2019re afraid to vote the right way,\u201d Biden said.",
      "The legislation provided an estimated $74 billion to $91 billion to shore up troubled multiemployer pension plans, which are funds that employers pay into under collective bargaining agreements. The funds can run into trouble when union membership declines over time, with more retirees drawing down benefits and fewer contributions going in on behalf of active workers.",
      "The White House said Pennsylvania is home to an estimated 65,000 of the workers and retirees helped by the legislation. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government-run entity that insures multiemployer pension plans, said Friday it had approved an application to pump $684 million into a plan covering 29,000 workers and retirees in the service sector.",
      "The pension rescue became something of a campaign story after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters\u2019 executive board declined to make an endorsement in the presidential race. The Teamsters had the largest pension plan saved from cuts, and so the decision not to back Harris angered many members and labor allies",
      "John Pishko, a retired Teamster from western Pennsylvania, spoke at the Philadelphia event about how the legislation helped save his retirement. He said he was set to lose 30% of his pension benefit, or about $1,000 a month, before Democrats stepped in with the bailout.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty substantial cut to any working man,\u201d Pishko said. \u201cIt was devastating.\u201d",
      "He had assumed he would \u201cnever\u201d be able to stave off those cuts.",
      "\u201cIt matters when you have a president and vice president who has your back,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "FRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Brandon Aubrey was pretty sure being the kicker for the Dallas Cowboys was going to get him out of jury duty.",
      "It\u2019s safe to say he was surprised to end up serving on a domestic violence case that lasted a week and ended with his jury sentencing the defendant to 65 years in prison.",
      "\u201cEye-opening, long, frustrating, depressing, hearing the story,\u201d Aubrey said Thursday in an interview conducted by a member of the Cowboys\u2019 media relations staff. \u201cThe story was a sad one. I don\u2019t really want to get into all the details of the story, but it was very depressing and dragged on longer than anybody expected it to. So, glad it\u2019s over.\u201d",
      "Aubrey wasn\u2019t in the Dallas locker room during the team\u2019s media availability on Thursday. A team staffer emailed a transcript of the interview with the kicker to the media later in the day.",
      "A year ago, Aubrey set an NFL record as a 28-year-old rookie by making the first 35 kicks of his career. A record streak of eight consecutive games with at least one field goal of 50 yards or longer ended last weekend in a 30-24 loss to San Francisco. The Cowboys (3-4) visit Atlanta (5-3) on Sunday.",
      "With Aubrey\u2019s anonymity likely blown by that kind of eventful start to his career, he said the judge told everyone during jury selection who he was.",
      "Aubrey said he has a sister-in-law who is a prosecutor, and she had assured him his celebrity would disqualify him.",
      "Aubrey, who had postponed his jury summons once but wasn\u2019t allowed to do it again, also thought he had a suitable conflict to present to the judge \u2014 being at the team\u2019s facility to prepare for last weekend\u2019s game in San Francisco.",
      "The judge acknowledged him by name and said he could come back to him on the issue of conflicts, Aubrey said. The next thing the kicker knows, the judge is saying Aubrey won\u2019t have any conflicts because the court won\u2019t be in session over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI could have been more assertive and at that point, everyone knows who I am there, and I don\u2019t want to sound like I think I\u2019m better than anyone else or that I\u2019m above the job,\u201d Aubrey said. \u201cSo kind of sat there quietly and didn\u2019t say anything, which was probably a mistake. I figured at that point still, he\u2019s not going to pick me.\u201d",
      "As it turned out, Aubrey had to scramble to get in his kicking work during the week. He didn\u2019t get to the facility until close to sundown Thursday of last week, first fighting the sunset and actually kicking in the dark for a spell with long snapper Trent Sieg and his holder, punter Bryan Anger.",
      "Aubrey couldn\u2019t kick in the comfort \u2014 and under the lights \u2014 of the team\u2019s indoor practice facility because of a high school game.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t really see where you\u2019re kicking, and for Bryan in particular, trying to catch the snaps, he had a hard time at first tracking the ball and hitting the spot,\u201d Aubrey said. \u201cSo, it was a lot harder, but really just wanted to get the leg moving and keep the body fresh for game day.\u201d",
      "Aubrey wasn\u2019t really tested against the 49ers, making his only field-goal attempt from 29 yards and all three extra points.",

    "title": "Lawsuit Against Elon Musk's $1 Million Voter Giveaway Heads Back To State Court",
    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 13:18:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Still, the tech mogul's ploy to move a civil lawsuit against him to federal court made the point of the suit nearly moot.",
    "story": [
      "In his face-off against Elon Musk, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has already earned at least one important win.",
      "A judge on Friday granted Krasner\u2019s request to keep a civil lawsuit he filed against Musk and Musk\u2019s pro-Trump America PAC in state court, rather than having it moved to federal court as the tech billionaire wished.",
      "Musk, for his part, filed a motion seeking to quash any personal appearance he is ordered to make in court, saying that his attendance is unnecessary because the case is largely focused on actions of America PAC.",
      "Earlier Friday morning, Musk had accused Krasner of engaging in a \u201crushed stage play\u201d and a \u201cspectacle\u201d as he urged a federal judge to deny Krasner\u2019s emergency request to keep the suit in state court.",
      "Krasner sued the billionaire and his pro-Donald Trump America PAC over their pledge to give away $1 million daily to registered voters. Musk claims the giveaway is random, but Krasner alleges that Musk is intentionally targeting people in battleground states with an \u201cillegal lottery scheme\u201d meant to influence voters.",
      "Musk has argued that Krasner must square off with America PAC attorneys in federal court because the lawsuit raises questions about a federal election and the federal laws that govern political action committees, not state matters.",
      "Krasner is adamant that his lawsuit isn\u2019t about whether Musk and America PAC are violating federal laws that ban vote-buying. Rather, the district attorney wants a state court, not a federal one, to determine whether the program violates Pennsylvania\u2019s prohibitions against illegal lotteries.",
      "Attorneys for Musk\u2019s PAC filed a notice in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania federal court this week requesting to have the case remanded there. Explaining this maneuver in a brief filed Friday, a lawyer for the PAC wrote that the group\u2019s expenditures are \u201cpolitical speech\u201d and thus \u201centitled to First Amendment protections,\u201d which is a federal jurisdictional issue.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert disagreed.",
      "Musk and America PAC \u201chave not identified any question of federal law that must be resolved in Plaintiff\u2019s favor in order to prove either state-law claim,\u201d Pappert\u2019s memorandum states.",
      "\u201cDefendants argue the Complaint\u2019s references to \u2018the forthcoming Federal Presidential Election\u2019 show the lawsuit necessarily raises questions of federal law,\u201d Pappert wrote. \u201cBut federal question jurisdiction does not turn on a plaintiff\u2019s motivations in filing suit; it turns on whether the legal issues arising from the claims originate in federal or state law.\u201d",
      "The ploy to have the lawsuit remanded to federal court may have been a boon for Musk anyway. The giveaway ends on Nov. 5, meaning that by the time the courts decide the next steps, the initiative will already be over.",
      "The Justice Department warned Musk in a letter last month that he may run afoul of federal election laws against compensating voters, but Musk was undeterred.",
      "Four giveaway winners are from Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, according to a website for the program. So far, the PAC has given away a total of $14 million to voters who signed the petition that states they agree to support the First and Second Amendments. The website indicates that winners will be declared through Nov. 5. As of Friday, the site specified that those winners would be selected in Arizona and Wisconsin, which are also battleground states in the 2024 election.",
      "Musk and Krasner were initially meant to face off in court on Friday, but the hearing was brought forward to Thursday. Krasner had asked to move the hearing to a more secure venue following a deluge of threats he said he received.",

    "summary": "William Luna started carving faces of deceased loved ones in 2017 to honor his rmother. Now he does them for others -- and strives to make them as accurate as possible.",
    "story": [
      "EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) \u2014 During the Day of the Dead celebrations that take place in late October and early November, Latin Americans honor their departed loved ones by setting up altars adorned with food, flowers and photographs. But what about carving the actual face of your deceased spouse or family member on a plaster to decorate a piece of bread?",
      "That is exactly what one artist in Bolivia is doing.",
      "As part of a centuries-old tradition to honor their dead on Nov. 2, Bolivians share a sweet bread called \u201ctantawawa\u201d (Aymara for \u201cbaby bread\u201d) in a symbolic way to connect the living with the dead.",
      "Traditionally, the \u201ctantawawa\u201d are decorated with generic, plastered faces, but Bolivian artist William Luna thought it would be even more symbolic if he could carve out a feature that resembles the loved ones that people are remembering.",
      "Inspired by the loss of his mother, Luna began sculpting her face onto a \u201ctantawawa\u201d for the first anniversary of her death in 2017. He then introduced this idea to local markets, and now receives requests from families eager to honor their loved ones in this unique way.",
      "\u201cFamilies ask for the masks to resemble their deceased loved ones as closely as possible,\u201d Luna explains. \u201cI focus on each person\u2019s distinctive features, as we all have something special that sets us apart.\u201d",
      "Luna meticulously crafts each mask, starting with a photo of the departed individual. He then shapes clay using his fingers and modeling tools to capture the person\u2019s likeness. Once satisfied with the clay model, he creates a plastic mold and fills it with plaster. The final step involves painting the mask, sometimes with the help of the family.",
      "The entire process takes about a week.",
      "Milton Eyzaguirre, an anthropologist from the National Museum of Ethnography and Folklore in La Paz, said that there\u2019s not an exact record of the origin of the \u201ctantawawa\u201d, only that they are pre-Hispanic. Historically, the bread was made with quinoa flour, but now wheat is commonly used.",
      "\u201cOur tradition holds that souls return hungry and thirsty, and that is why families have food waiting for them,\u201d he said.",
      "Luna, the artist, says that his idea is to give people a way to see their deceased loved ones again.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s only in this way,\u201d he said, gazing at some of the plastered faces.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 11:39:55 -0400",
    "summary": "It took three ER visits and 20 hours before a hospital admitted Nevaeh Crain, 18, as her condition worsened. Doctors insisted on two ultrasounds to confirm \u201cfetal demise.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "This story was originally published by ProPublica.",
      "Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. \u201cDo something,\u201d she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023.",
      "Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the 18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time worse than before.",
      "The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave.",
      "Now on Crain\u2019s third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to \u201cconfirm fetal demise,\u201d a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care.",
      "By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain\u2019s blood pressure had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were \u201cblue and dusky.\u201d Her organs began failing.",
      "Hours later, she was dead.",
      "Fails, who would have seen her daughter turn 20 this Friday, still cannot understand why Crain\u2019s emergency was not treated like an emergency.",
      "But that is what many pregnant women are now facing in states with strict abortion bans, doctors and lawyers have told ProPublica.",
      "\u201cPregnant women have become essentially untouchables,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor emerita at George Washington University.",
      "Texas\u2019s abortion ban threatens prison time for interventions that end a fetal heartbeat, whether the pregnancy is wanted or not. It includes exceptions for life-threatening conditions, but still, doctors told ProPublica that confusion and fear about the potential legal repercussions are changing the way their colleagues treat pregnant patients with complications.",
      "In states with abortion bans, such patients are sometimes bounced between hospitals like \u201chot potatoes,\u201d with health care providers reluctant to participate in treatment that could attract a prosecutor, doctors told ProPublica. In some cases, medical teams are wasting precious time debating legalities and creating documentation, preparing for the possibility that they\u2019ll need to explain their actions to a jury and judge.",
      "Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, said patients are left wondering: \u201cAm I being sent home because I really am OK? Or am I being sent home because they\u2019re afraid that the solution to what\u2019s going on with my pregnancy would be ending the pregnancy, and they\u2019re not allowed to do that?\u201d",
      "There is a federal law to prevent emergency room doctors from withholding lifesaving care.",
      "Passed nearly four decades ago, it requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients in medical crises. The Biden administration argues this mandate applies even in cases where an abortion might be necessary.",
      "No state has done more to fight this interpretation than Texas, which has warned doctors that its abortion ban supersedes the administration\u2019s guidance on federal law, and that they can face up to 99 years in prison for violating it.",
      "ProPublica condensed more than 800 pages of Crain\u2019s medical records into a four-page timeline in consultation with two maternal-fetal medicine specialists; reporters reviewed it with nine doctors, including researchers at prestigious universities, OB-GYNs who regularly handle miscarriages, and experts in emergency medicine and maternal health.",
      "Some said the first ER missed warning signs of infection that deserved attention. All said that the doctor at the second hospital should never have sent Crain home when her signs of sepsis hadn\u2019t improved. And when she returned for the third time, all said there was no medical reason to make her wait for two ultrasounds before taking aggressive action to save her.",
      "\u201cThis is how these restrictions kill women,\u201d said Dr. Dara Kass, a former regional director at the Department of Health and Human Services and an emergency room physician in New York. \u201cIt is never just one decision, it\u2019s never just one doctor, it\u2019s never just one nurse.\u201d",
      "While they were not certain from looking at the records provided that Crain\u2019s death could have been prevented, they said it may have been possible to save both the teenager and her fetus if she had been admitted earlier for close monitoring and continuous treatment.",
      "There was a chance Crain could have remained pregnant, they said. If she had needed an early delivery, the hospital was well-equipped to care for a baby on the edge of viability. In another scenario, if the infection had gone too far, ending the pregnancy might have been necessary to save Crain.",
      "Doctors involved in Crain\u2019s care did not respond to several requests for comment. The two hospitals, Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas and Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth, declined to answer detailed lists of questions about her treatment.",
      "Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. The teen could only support it in the context of rape or life-threatening illness, she used to tell her mother. They didn\u2019t care whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions.",
      "When they discovered Crain was pregnant with a girl, the two talked endlessly about the little dresses they could buy, what kind of mother she would be. Crain landed on the name Lillian. Fails could not wait to meet her.",
      "But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency, even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal heartbeat than attending to Crain.",
      "\u201cI know it sounds selfish, and God knows I would rather have both of them, but if I had to choose,\u201d Fails said, \u201cI would have chosen my daughter.\u201d",
      "Crain had just graduated from high school in her hometown of Vidor, Texas, in May of 2023 when she learned that she was pregnant.",
      "She and her boyfriend of two years, Randall Broussard, were always hip to hip, wrestling over vapes or snuggling on the couch watching vampire movies. Crain was drawn to how gentle he was. He admired how easily she built friendships and how quickly she could make people laugh. Though they were young, they\u2019d already imagined starting a family. Broussard, who has eight siblings, wanted many kids; Crain wanted a daughter and the kind of relationship she had with her mom. Earlier that year, Broussard had given Crain a small diamond ring \u2014 \u201ca promise,\u201d he told her, \u201cthat I will always love you.\u201d",
      "On the morning of their baby shower, Oct. 28, 2023, Crain woke with a headache. Her mom decorated the house with pink balloons and Crain laid out Halloween-themed platters. Soon, nausea set in. Crain started vomiting and was running a fever. When guests arrived, Broussard opened gifts \u2014 onesies and diapers and bows \u2014 while Crain kept closing her eyes.",
      "Around 3 p.m., her family told her she needed to go to the hospital.",
      "Broussard drove Crain to Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas. They sat in the waiting room for four hours. When Crain started vomiting, staff brought her a plastic pan. When she wasn\u2019t retching, she lay her head in her boyfriend\u2019s lap.",
      "A nurse practitioner ordered a test for strep throat, which came back positive, medical records show. But in a pregnant patient, abdominal pain and vomiting should not be quickly attributed to strep, physicians told ProPublica; a doctor should have also evaluated her pregnancy.",
      "Instead, Baptist Hospitals discharged her with a prescription for antibiotics. She was home at 9 p.m. and quickly dozed off, but within hours, she woke her mother up. \u201cMom, my stomach is still hurting,\u201d she said into the dark bedroom at 3 a.m. \u201cI\u2019m in a lot of pain.\u201d",
      "Fails drove Broussard and Crain to another hospital in town, Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth. Around 4:20 a.m., OB-GYN William Hawkins saw that Crain had a temperature of 102.8 and an abnormally high pulse, according to records; a nurse noted that Crain rated her abdominal pain as a seven out of 10.",
      "Her vital signs pointed to possible sepsis, records show. It\u2019s standard medical practice to immediately treat patients who show signs of sepsis, which can overtake and kill a person quickly, medical experts told ProPublica. These patients should be watched until their vitals improve. Through tests and scans, the goal is to find the source of the infection. If the infection was in Crain\u2019s uterus, the fetus would likely need to be removed with a surgery.",
      "In a room at the obstetric emergency department, a nurse wrapped a sensor belt around Crain\u2019s belly to check the fetal heart rate. \u201cBaby\u2019s fine,\u201d Broussard told Fails, who was sitting in the hallway.",
      "After two hours of IV fluids, one dose of antibiotics, and some Tylenol, Crain\u2019s fever didn\u2019t go down, her pulse remained high, and the fetal heart rate was abnormally fast, medical records show. Hawkins noted that Crain had strep and a urinary tract infection, wrote up a prescription and discharged her.",
      "Hawkins had missed infections before. Eight years earlier, the Texas Medical Board found that he had failed to diagnose appendicitis in one patient and syphilis in another. In the latter case, the board noted that his error \u201cmay have contributed to the fetal demise of one of her twins.\u201d The board issued an order to have Hawkins\u2019 medical practice monitored; the order was lifted two years later. (Hawkins did not respond to several attempts to reach him.)",
      "All of the doctors who reviewed Crain\u2019s vital signs for ProPublica said she should have been admitted. \u201cShe should have never left, never left,\u201d said Elise Boos, an OB-GYN in Tennessee.",
      "Kass, the New York emergency physician, put it in starker terms: When they discharged her, they were \u201cpushing her down the path of no return.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Fails said as Broussard rolled Crain out in a wheelchair; she was unable to walk on her own. Fails had expected the hospital to keep her overnight. Her daughter was breathing heavily, hunched over in pain, pale in the face. Normally talkative, the teen was quiet.",
      "Back home, around 7 a.m., Fails tried to get her daughter comfortable as she cried and moaned. She told Fails she needed to pee, and her mother helped her into the bathroom. \u201cMom, come here,\u201d she said from the toilet. Blood stained her underwear.",
      "The blood confirmed Fails\u2019 instinct: This was a miscarriage.",
      "At 9 a.m, a full day after the nausea began, they were back at Christus St. Elizabeth. Crain\u2019s lips were drained of color and she kept saying she was going to pass out. Staff started her on IV antibiotics and performed a bedside ultrasound.",
      "Around 9:30 a.m., the OB on duty, Dr. Marcelo Totorica, couldn\u2019t find a fetal heart rate, according to records; he told the family he was sorry for their loss.",
      "Standard protocol when a critically ill patient experiences a miscarriage is to stabilize her and, in most cases, hurry to the operating room for delivery, medical experts said. This is especially urgent with a spreading infection. But at Christus St. Elizabeth, the OB-GYN just continued antibiotic care. A half-hour later, as nurses placed a catheter, Fails noticed her daughter\u2019s thighs were covered in blood.",
      "At 10 a.m., Melissa McIntosh, a labor and delivery nurse, spoke to Totorica about Crain\u2019s condition. The teen was now having contractions. \u201cDr. Totorica states to not move patient,\u201d she wrote after talking with him. \u201cDr. Totorica states there is a slight chance patient may need to go to ICU and he wants the bedside ultrasound to be done stat for sure before admitting to room.\u201d",
      "Though he had already performed an ultrasound, he was asking for a second.",
      "The first hadn\u2019t preserved an image of Crain\u2019s womb in the medical record. \u201cBedside ultrasounds aren\u2019t always set up to save images permanently,\u201d said Abbott, the Boston OB-GYN.",
      "The state\u2019s laws banning abortion require that doctors record the absence of a fetal heartbeat before intervening with a procedure that could end a pregnancy. Exceptions for medical emergencies demand physicians document their reasoning. \u201cPretty consistently, people say, \u2018Until we can be absolutely certain this isn\u2019t a normal pregnancy, we can\u2019t do anything, because it could be alleged that we were doing an abortion,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Tony Ogburn, an OB-GYN in San Antonio.",
      "At 10:40 a.m, Crain\u2019s blood pressure was dropping. Minutes later, Totorica was paging for an emergency team over the loudspeakers.",
      "Around 11 a.m., two hours after Crain had arrived at the hospital, a second ultrasound was performed. A nurse noted: \u201cBedside ultrasound at this time to confirm fetal demise per Dr. Totorica\u2019s orders.\u201d",
      "When doctors wheeled Crain into the ICU at 11:20 a.m., Fails stayed by her side, rubbing her head, as her daughter dipped in and out of consciousness. Crain couldn\u2019t sign consent forms for her care because of \u201cextreme pain,\u201d according to the records, so Fails signed a release for \u201cunplanned dilation and curettage\u201d or \u201cunplanned cesarean section.\u201d",
      "But the doctors quickly decided it was now too risky to operate, according to records. They suspected that she had developed a dangerous complication of sepsis known as disseminated intravascular coagulation; she was bleeding internally.",
      "Frantic and crying, Fails locked eyes with her daughter. \u201cYou\u2019re strong, Nevaeh,\u201d she said. \u201cGod made us strong.\u201d",
      "Crain sat up in the cot. Old, black blood gushed from her nostrils and mouth.",
      "Crain is one of at least two pregnant Texas women who died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages, ProPublica found.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has successfully made his state the only one in the country that isn\u2019t required to follow the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to ensure that emergency departments don\u2019t turn away patients like Crain.",
      "After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, the administration issued guidance on how states with bans should follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The federal law requires hospitals that receive funding through Medicare \u2014 which is virtually all of them \u2014 to stabilize or transfer anyone who arrives in their emergency rooms. That goes for pregnant patients, the guidance argues, even if that means violating state law and providing an abortion.",
      "Paxton responded by filing a lawsuit in 2022, saying the federal guidance \u201cforces hospitals and doctors to commit crimes,\u201d and was an \u201cattempt to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.\u201d",
      "Part of the battle has centered on who is eligible for abortion. The federal EMTALA guidelines apply when the health of the pregnant patient is in \u201cserious jeopardy.\u201d That\u2019s a wider range of circumstances than the Texas abortion restriction, which only makes exceptions for a \u201crisk of death\u201d or \u201ca serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit worked its way through three layers of federal courts, and each time it was met by judges nominated by former President Donald Trump, whose court appointments were pivotal to overturning Roe v. Wade.",
      "After U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, quickly sided with Texas, Paxton celebrated the triumph over \u201cleft-wing bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision last night proves what we knew all along,\u201d Paxton added. \u201cThe law is on our side.\u201d",
      "This year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the order in a ruling authored by Kurt D. Engelhardt, another judge nominated by Trump.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the justices to make it clear that some emergency abortions are allowed.",
      "Even amid news of preventable deaths related to abortion bans, the Supreme Court declined to do so last month.",
      "Paxton called this \u201ca major victory\u201d for the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "He has also made clear that he will bring charges against physicians for performing abortions if he decides that the cases don\u2019t fall within Texas\u2019 narrow medical exceptions.",
      "Last year, he sent a letter threatening to prosecute a doctor who had received court approval to provide an emergency abortion for a Dallas woman. He insisted that the doctor and her patient had not proven how, precisely, the patient\u2019s condition threatened her life.",
      "Many doctors say this kind of message has encouraged doctors to \u201cpunt\u201d patients instead of treating them.",
      "Since the abortion bans went into effect, an OB-GYN at a major hospital in San Antonio has seen an uptick in pregnant patients being sent to them from across Southern Texas, as they suffer from complications that could easily be treated close to home.",
      "The well-resourced hospital is perceived to have more institutional support to provide abortions and miscarriage management, the doctor said. Other providers \u201care transferring those patients to our centers because, frankly, they don\u2019t want to deal with them.\u201d",
      "After Crain died, Fails couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how Christus Southeast Hospital had ignored her daughter\u2019s condition. \u201cShe was bleeding,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they do anything to help it along instead of wait for another ultrasound to confirm the baby is dead?\u201d",
      "It was the medical examiner, not the doctors at the hospital, who removed Lillian from Crain\u2019s womb. His autopsy didn\u2019t resolve Fails\u2019 lingering questions about what the hospitals missed and why. He called the death \u201cnatural\u201d and attributed it to \u201ccomplications of pregnancy.\u201d He did note, however, that Crain was \u201crepeatedly seeking medical care for a progressive illness\u201d just before she died.",

      "Though the human dead usually get their favorite food or drink placed on altars, the nature of pet food can make things a little different.",
      "The holiday has roots in Mexican pre-Hispanic customs, as does the reverence for animals. The small, hairless dogs that Mexicans kept before the Spanish conquest were believed to help guide their owners to the afterlife, and were sometimes given special burials.",
      "But the inclusion of pets on family altars has grown in recent years.",
      "Day of the Dead begins Oct. 31, to remember those humans who died in accidents; it continues Nov. 1 to mark those who died in childhood and then Nov. 2 to those who died as adults.",
      "Observances include entire families cleaning and decorating graves, which are covered with orange marigolds. At both cemeteries and at home altars, relatives light candles, put out offerings of the favorite foods and beverages of their deceased relatives.",

      "Multiple anonymous complaints about Peanut \u2014 also spelled P\u2019Nut or PNUT \u2014 brought at least six officers from the state Department of Environmental Conservation to Mark Longo\u2019s home near the Pennsylvania border in rural Pine City on Wednesday, Longo said.",
      "\u201cThe DEC came to my house and raided my house without a search warrant to find a squirrel!\u201d said Longo, who is 34. \u201cI was treated as if I was a drug dealer and they were going for drugs and guns.\u201d",
      "The officers left with Peanut, who amassed hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms during his seven years with Longo. They also took Fred, a more recent addition to the family.",

      "Longo, who runs an animal refuge inspired by his squirrel buddy called P\u2019Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary, took to Instagram to mourn Peanut\u2019s loss.",
      "\u201cWell internet, you WON,\u201d Longo posted. \u201cYou took one of the most amazing animals away from me because of your selfishness. To the group of people who called DEC, there\u2019s a special place in hell for you.\u201d",
      "Longo fears that Peanut has been euthanized. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Peanut is alive,\u201d he said in a phone interview Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "With just three days until the election, former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign remains unsettled about his prospects in North Carolina, a Sun Belt state that he\u2019s claimed in two consecutive presidential elections.",
      "When asked why, a Trump campaign official put it bluntly.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one state that could bite you in the a--, it\u2019s North Carolina,\u201d the official said.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "At the same time, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 team, which less than two weeks ago feared the Tar Heel State was \u201ca little bit slipping away,\u201d is now seeing it as \u201cvery much in play,\u201d a senior campaign official said.",
      "Their dueling outlooks emerged as both campaigns landed in North Carolina, with the candidates rallying voters in a margin-of-error contest that\u2019s raising the stakes in every battleground. Of late, Trump has deviated off course and into states like Virginia and New Mexico in the final days of the campaign, declaring he could expand his map.",
      "Yet he\u2019s made a plan of returning to North Carolina each day until the election.",
      "On Saturday, Trump held rallies in Greensboro and Gastonia, visiting Virginia in between, while Harris landed in Charlotte for a large rally. Trump returns Sunday to Kinston and then is scheduled to hold a rally in Raleigh on Monday.",
      "While Harris campaign aides on social media chided Trump for holding a defensive posture in a state that hasn\u2019t gone blue since 2008, the Trump campaign cast the repeated visits to North Carolina as an aggressive, cover-all-the-bases strategy.",
      "\u201cNow the fate of our nation is in your hands,\u201d Trump said at his rally in Gastonia Saturday. \u201cWe win this state, we\u2019re going to win the whole ballgame.\u201d",
      "Like many battlegrounds, polling averages of North Carolina show the state within the margin of error, handing Trump a slight edge.",
      "The political dynamics have sharply shifted in the closing months of the race after Hurricane Helene smashed into the western part of the state, destroying entire towns and displacing scores of people, largely in rural areas. A torrent of misinformation pushed by Trump \u2014 even as it was\u00a0debunked by members\u00a0of his own party \u2014 had Democrats fearing the narrative was too much to overcome.",
      "But Harris remains within striking distance. If she manages to claim the state, she could conceivably block a Trump path to victory. But she would still need to win Pennsylvania, a state where each campaign has landed more than any other.",
      "If Harris loses Pennsylvania but keeps the other \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Wisconsin and Michigan and somehow wins North Carolina, it would still not be enough to win the necessary 270 Electoral College votes.",
      "She would also need electoral votes from another state that President Joe Biden won in 2020, such as Nevada. So far, Republicans are demonstrating strength compared to Democrats in early voter turnout in the Silver State, with a large group of unaffiliated voters also turning out. It\u2019s unclear how those voters are breaking, and Election Day turnout remains an unknown, as well as cross-party voting.",
      "One longtime Republican strategist involved in voter turnout efforts in North Carolina who was not authorized to speak publicly said Trump should feel emboldened by the strength of his party\u2019s early turnout.",
      "\u201cBefore this election, Republicans have never had a cumulative lead in early vote,\u201d the person said. \u201cHowever, this is not just vote-shifting. We studied this. Republicans in North Carolina have had less of a cannibalization rate,\u201d he added, referring to the rate of high-propensity voters who are simply voting earlier.",
      "This election\u2019s Republican early-voting surge can be attributed, at least in part, to the party\u2019s heavy messaging on voting early. Data as of Friday shows Republicans leading Democrats in North Carolina. But like Nevada, unaffiliated voters also made up a large portion of the early voter electorate and it is largely unknown how they are breaking.",
      "Democrats have a far different interpretation on the early numbers.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are definitely turning out at a clip slightly better than Democrats. But ... my read is that early vote is 55% female, and every single poll shows that women are supporting Democrats and posting their largest gender gap in North Carolina history,\u201d said Democratic strategist Morgan Jackson.",
      "Jackson added that suburban voters were voting at higher rates than their registration share by 2 points, and that in every competitive election since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Democrats outperformed polling with women, unaffiliated voters, suburban voters and Republican women.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m an optimist about this election,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI think the fact that Trump is visiting North Carolina more than any state over the last few days says they are seeing the same thing in the early voting numbers that I am and they are concerned.\u201d",
      "North Carolina Democrats have also expressed confidence that they have a superior ground game. Voter registration numbers surged once Harris joined the race, and her rallies in the state have drawn large crowds, including Saturday\u2019s, which drew about 10,000 people, according to the campaign. Republicans have pointed to lower Black turnout as a red flag for Democrats in the state, but strategists in the party say it\u2019s basically remained at pre-Obama levels, which they have expected.",
      "Democrats have also swamped Republicans overall with advertising in the state, spending $66.2 million to $42.4 million from Oct. 1 through Nov. 2. But Republicans have been closing that gap. A huge ad-spending edge from Oct. 1 through Oct. 26 ($54 million for Democrats and almost $29 million for Republicans) evaporated in the last week, when Republicans narrowly outspent Democrats $13.7 million to $12.3 million, all according to AdImpact, an ad tracking firm.",
      "In Charlotte on Saturday, Harris pleaded for voters to get to the polls and to turn the page on Trump, whom she characterized as divisive.",
      "\u201cNorth Carolina, I\u2019m here to ask for your vote. \u2026 I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to the challenges you face,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cI pledge to you to listen to experts, to listen to people who disagree with me. Because you see, unlike Donald Trump, I don\u2019t believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy.\u201d"

      "Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who has a history of pushing conspiracy theories, is primed to play a key role in a future Trump administration\u2019s health policy. Since dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing Trump, Kennedy has frequently appeared on the campaign stumping for the former president, and Trump said at a rally this week that if he is elected, Kennedy is \u201cgoing to work on health and women\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Trump has embraced Kennedy. At an event in Arizona earlier this week, the former president said that Kennedy \u201ccan do anything he wants\u201d in a potential Trump administration.",
      "\u201cHe really wants to with the pesticides and the, you know, all the different things. I said, \u2018He can do it. He can do anything he wants.\u2019 He wants to look at the vaccines. He wants \u2014 everything. I think it\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s great,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In late October, Trump said that having Kennedy as an ally \u201cis such a great honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines,\u201d Trump said at that event.",
      "Kennedy, a former independent presidential candidate, has touted widely debunked theories linking vaccines and autism. He also previously said that he would support a national ban on abortion after three months of pregnancy, before quickly walking back his comments.",
      "When reached for comment on Kennedy\u2019s proposal, Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez did not commit to backing the plan.",
      "\u201cWhile President Trump has received a variety of policy ideas, he is focused on Tuesday\u2019s election,\u201d Alvarez said in a statement.",
      "Major public health groups such as the\u00a0American Dental Association, the\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0and the\u00a0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention support water fluoridation, citing studies showing that the mineral helps fight cavities. Health groups also emphasize that the practice is safe.",
      "\u201cWater fluoridation is an equitable and inexpensive way to ensure that prevention of dental disease reaches everyone in a community,\u201d the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 website says.",

      "Fluoride helps make teeth \u201cstronger and more resistant to decay,\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s website, and drinking fluoridated water \u201creduces cavities by about 25% in children and adults.\u201d",
      "\u201cDocumented risks of community water fluoridation are limited to dental fluorosis, a change in dental enamel that is cosmetic in its most common form. Changes range from barely visible lacy white markings in milder cases to pitting of the teeth in the rare, severe form,\u201d the CDC\u2019s website says, noting that most dental fluorosis seen in the U.S. today is \u201cof the mildest form.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Control of the House and Senate are up for grabs in Tuesday's 2024 elections, with the next Congress facing key deadlines on taxes, health care, government funding and the debt ceiling.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As voters head to the polls for Tuesday's elections, they will also be electing a new Congress. And whichever party wins control of the House and Senate will get to decide how to handle a slew of consequential policy matters.",
      "Whether it\u2019s expiring tax cuts and health care subsidies, another round of government funding or must-pass measures like a debt limit extension and a new farm bill, Congress will have its hands full.",
      "And the next president \u2014 Donald Trump or Kamala Harris \u2014 along with the new Congress will set the agenda.",
      "Here are four big things the 119th Congress will have to tackle.",
      "Trump tax cuts worth trillions of dollars are expiring after 2025",
      "Major portions of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax law totaling $3.3 trillion will expire at the end of 2025. And the question of what gets extended under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act \u2014 and what is allowed to expire \u2014 depends on which party wins this election.",
      "It will be one of the most important tasks of the new Congress, with sweeping tax hikes on the line if lawmakers fail to act. If the expiring provisions are allowed to lapse, the standard deduction for tax filers will be cut in half, the top rate for the highest earners will rise from 37% to 39.6%, and the exemption for paying estate taxes will be halved, among others changes.",
      "Former President Trump has said he wants to fully extend the expiring tax breaks across all income levels and pursue deeper tax cuts. Vice President Harris and Democrats say they want to extend the tax cuts for those making $400,000 or less, while ending them for the wealthiest Americans.",
      "Another issue at stake: the deduction for state and local taxes, or \u201cSALT,\u201d which Trump and Republicans capped at $10,000 in the 2017 law. That limit resets to infinity at the end of 2025. Trump has wobbled on the issue, while Democratic leaders are determined to lift the SALT cap, which disproportionately hit Americans in high-tax blue states like California and New York.",
      "A slew of Obamacare subsidies ending, threatening premium spikes",
      "An expansion of funding under the Affordable Care Act, passed by Democrats in 2021 and extended the following year, expires at the end of 2025. The funding expands premium tax credits to ensure that Americans can purchase a silver \u201cbenchmark\u201d plan on the Obamacare exchanges for no more than 8.5% of their income.",
      "Will that money be extended? If it lapses, many Americans would see spikes in their insurance premiums, which may put pressure on Congress to act. Continuing the funding is estimated to cost about $25 billion per year, according to a 2022 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The outcome could be markedly different depending on the election. Harris has called for extending the money and protecting the 2010 ACA, a major legacy for Democrats that was signed by President Barack Obama. Republicans may be a tougher sell to authorize the funding. Trump has a long history of trying to unravel the ACA and called for replacing the law during a September debate.",
      "The debt ceiling needs to be extended, again",
      "The next debt ceiling fight is slated for 2025; the country will hit the debt limit on Jan. 1 and begin to use \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to pay the bills. Those measures are likely to last for months, and the Treasury Department will later announce an \u201cX date\u201d by which Congress must act or risk default.",
      "The debt ceiling is one of the peculiar things about Congress: It routinely passes laws forcing the U.S. government to borrow money but then requires itself to vote separately on whether to borrow the money or default on the nation\u2019s financial obligations, which economists say could spark a global economic meltdown.",
      "And over the last decade and a half, debt ceiling fights have gotten increasingly intense on Capitol Hill, with a Republican-controlled House taking the U.S. to the brink multiple times amid conservative demands for spending cuts as a price of raising the debt limit.",
      "Will there be another intense fight next year? That depends on who wins this week\u2019s elections and whether the result empowers conservatives known to use the borrowing limit as a vehicle for making policy demands.",
      "There'll be another government funding fight",
      "Funding for major parts of the federal government is set to expire on Dec. 20, 2024, requiring the lame duck Congress to deal with it after the election. But whether lawmakers punt the issue into early 2025 or reach a full funding deal by the end of this year, the new Congress will return to the drawing board and renegotiate the size of government with the president at some point next year.",
      "Government funding bills and stopgap measures are subject to the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold, which routinely makes keeping the government running a bipartisan endeavor no matter who controls Congress or the White House. But the priorities could be very different depending on which party wins the election and what the margins in Congress look like. A faction of hard-right House Republicans aligned with Trump have urged government shutdowns if they don\u2019t get their way on spending. If they wield influence next year, things could get messy.",
      "Riding along with government funding is the farm bill \u2014 an agriculture and food policy law that is supposed to be passed every five years. The last one expired in 2023 and has since been running on autopilot. The next Congress will be challenged to strike a long-term deal on matters like farm subsidies and food stamps.",
      "A divided government could make each party equal partners in negotiating the next round of funding and agriculture policy, while a \u201ctrifecta\u201d for one party would empower it to set the agenda."

    "story": [
      "With Pennsylvania expected to be a close and crucial state in the 2024 race for the presidency, it's unusual election laws are again under the microscope.",
      "First, there's the counting. The state doesn\u2019t have early voting \u2014 instead offering the time-consuming and paperwork heavy option of on-demand mail balloting. It also doesn\u2019t process its mail ballots ahead of Election Day.",
      "So, in the hours after polls close on Election Day, when many battleground states will be reporting their early, mail and Election Day totals, Pennsylvania will be counting ballots around the clock in a mad dash to catch up.",
      "Then there's the \"fixing\" or \"curing\" of ballots with minor errors, such as a mail-in ballot mixing a signature. If a ballot has errors, each county in the state decides on its own whether it will let voters \"fix\" them, creating significant differences in voting policy throughout the state. (Most states have a statewide policy for curing ballots.)",
      "And finally, after the ballots are counted, there can be challenges. Pennsylvania laws give residents a spate of ways to challenge and delay certification of the results with recounts, appeals, and litigation.",
      "Election experts say Pennsylvania's laws make it fertile ground for rigged election claims to flourish. They also stressed that there is little reason to believe that unsubstantiated voter fraud claims\u2014and any lawsuits associated with them\u2014will actually stop the certification of the results.",
      "\u201cThe Pennsylvania legislature had multiple opportunities to clarify and improve the state\u2019s election law,\u201d said Nate Persily, an NBC News election law expert and professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cIt deliberately chose not to. The gaps in the law provide a vacuum that gets filled with conspiracy theories and require the courts to bring coherence to an incoherent regime.\u201d",
      "Former President Donald Trump and his campaign are already targeting Pennsylvania, falsely claiming there is large-scale \u201ccheating\u201d and \u201cvoter fraud\u201d at play.",
      "Trump's campaign has repeatedly portrayed the long lines in Bucks County during on-demand mail balloting as a form of voter suppression that, according to vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, was \"voter fraud\" perpetrated by Democrats. (The state's Republican secretary of the commonwealth, Al Schmidt, rejected Vance's claim.)",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve already started\u00a0cheating in Lancaster, they\u2019ve cheated. We caught \u2018em with 2600 votes,\u201d Trump said at a recent rally, misconstruing a real incident where hundreds of fraudulent voter registration applications were identified and rejected in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.",
      "This type of disinformation campaign is what worries Wendy Weiser most. As vice president for democracy at the\u00a0Brennan Center\u00a0for Justice at NYU Law School, Weiser said she isn\u2019t concerned that partisans will somehow block the certification of the results. \"Those are not battles that are going to succeed,\u201d she told NBC News recently.",
      "But she fears that Trump's \"disinformation campaign\" and \"broad propaganda efforts\" will \"cause people to think there is something wrong with the election,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge danger that we\u2019re already in.\u201d",
      "Once the results are counted, there are several ways for the Trump campaign \u2014 if it loses \u2014 and its allies to challenge the results.",
      "\u201cWe\u00a0should\u00a0expect a spate of local litigation throughout the state in the immediate aftermath of the election, not because those suits are meritorious, but because Pennsylvania law is rife with such opportunities,\u201d said Michael Morse, an NBC News election law expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law.",
      "State law allows any \u201caggrieved\u201d person who disagrees with how a county board handled its results to appeal them within two days, something that will delay certification temporarily, Morse said in an email. Limited recounts can be demanded by as few as three voters in a precinct, per state law, something that helped delay Pennsylvania's 2022 result certification by weeks.",
      "But the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania has tightened the standard for such a recount, requiring petitioners to identify and show evidence that fraud or error occurred, Morse said.",
      "Trump supporters on county boards across the country have sought to block the certification of election results by delaying or voting against the certification in the past.",
      "All three experts, though, agreed that Pennsylvania's courts have tools and legal precedents that allow them to force certification of the results when no credible claims of large-scale voter fraud exist.",
      "State courts have also taken steps to ensure that legal challenges are handled swiftly. The state Supreme Court has expedited its election appeal period from ten to three days to ensure that the state certifies its results by the December 11th federal deadline created by the Electoral Count Reform Act, enacted in 2022 to clarify the counting of presidential election results.",
      "\u201cThe concern to me is less certification of the vote by December 11,\" Morse said, \"than the collateral damage to voter confidence that bad-faith actors can easily inflict along the way.\u201d"

      "Once the last voter casts their ballot in a state and the polls close, the process of revealing the winner begins. That\u2019s when Election Day turns into election night, and each state starts reporting its vote totals.",
      "Some states \u2014 like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina \u2014 report their vote quickly, while others like Arizona, Nevada and California typically take longer, upward of a week or two to tabulate most of their ballots. Within many states, the patterns of how votes are reported can make it difficult to tell in the middle of election night who the winner is going to be in the end.",
      "For example, vote returns can skew toward one party early in a night because only a certain type of vote is reported first \u2014 like when mail ballots are counted before any in-person Election Day votes. These patterns can create what are sometimes referred to as \u201cvote mirages.\u201d",

      "A vote mirage is when the current vote count shows a candidate getting a higher percentage of the vote than they will ultimately end up with in the final count. Mirages can be \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d depending on which party appears to be benefiting \u2014 but \u201cappears\u201d is the really important thing here, because like any other mirage, a vote mirage is fleeting and doesn\u2019t reflect the final reality.",
      "The factors that produce a vote mirage",
      "Generally speaking, there are three factors that produce vote mirages: geography, vote mode and order of tabulation.",
      "Mirages can emerge because of geographic differences in the counties that report more quickly or more slowly. It\u2019s common for small, rural counties or precincts to report their tallies more quickly than large, urban ones, because the logistics of counting votes are simpler when there are fewer ballots to handle. As a result, since voters in rural areas are more likely to be Republican than voters in urban areas, a red mirage can happen when a state\u2019s vote count overrepresents rural areas at a certain point on election night.",
      "Virginia is an example of a state that usually has a geography-driven red mirage early on election night. This is because Fairfax County, a high-population suburb of Washington, D.C., where Joe Biden received 70% of the vote in 2020, tends to be one of the last counties in the state to report most of its results. Until Fairfax County has reported most or all of its votes, Donald Trump will likely have a statewide vote percentage that is higher than his final statewide total.",
      "On election night 2020, Fairfax County reported the results from a majority of its ballots (nearly 375,000 votes) at 11:43 p.m. ET. This single report caused Trump\u2019s statewide vote percentage to shrink in that moment from 50.2% to 45.8%. (That\u2019s close to Trump\u2019s final vote share in Virginia, 44%.)",
      "Another factor that can cause vote mirages is partisan differences by vote mode \u2014 mail ballots, early in-person votes, Election Day in-person votes, and so on.",
      "Many states and counties tend to report the results of each mode one at a time. This can cause vote mirages if one party is more likely than the other to cast its votes using a particular mode. This was the case in 2020, when Democrats voted more by mail than Republicans, and Republicans were much more likely to show up on Election Day.",
      "This difference caused a large blue mirage in North Carolina in 2020. In the first hour after polls closed, most North Carolina counties had reported their mail and early in-person votes. Those votes were heavily Democratic, and at 8:18 p.m. ET, Biden was at 57.6% in the statewide vote count. But over the next three hours, the state reported its heavily Republican Election Day votes, causing Biden\u2019s vote percentage to shrink to his final number there, 48.6%.",
      "The third factor that can produce vote mirages is more complicated: differences in the order that specific modes of ballots are counted. This tends to be the most consequential in states and counties that report the results of their mail ballots in small batches.",
      "Many election offices tend to count their mail ballots in the order that they were received, meaning that ballots returned by voters in mid-October will appear in the vote tallies earlier than those received on Election Day. This will produce a vote mirage if there are partisan differences between the earliest-returned mail ballots and the later-returned ones.",
      "This is what occurred in Arizona in 2020. The mail ballots reported by Maricopa County (which accounts for 60% of the state\u2019s voters) on election night included those returned by voters by the weekend before Election Day. This ended up producing a blue mirage, because those earlier mail votes were more Democratic than the later ones.",
      "The results of the later-returned mail ballots were reported in the days following Election Day. Because those late-arriving mail ballots were heavily pro-Republican, Donald Trump\u2019s vote count grew from 46.8% at 3 a.m. ET on election night to his ultimate vote share of 48.9% \u2014 just shy of Biden\u2019s 49.2%.",
      "Interestingly, Arizona\u2019s pattern in the 2018 midterm election was the opposite. Late-arriving mail ballots were much more heavily pro-Democratic, and, once they were added, the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, went from trailing by 0.8 percentage points on Election Night to winning the election by 2 points.",
      "What to watch for in terms of mirages in each state",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk accounts for these mirages when deciding whether to project the winner in a race. For example, we are less likely to project a Republican winner in a state if all the remaining uncounted ballots are expected to come from heavily Democratic counties. Conversely, we are less likely to make a projection if the Democrat is ahead but most of the uncounted ballots are expected to be strongly Republican, in-person Election Day votes.",
      "We are also cautious about assuming that historical patterns will hold in 2024, especially given that the 2020 election was held during a pandemic, with voters more likely to vote by mail and social distancing affecting how election officials tabulated the results. This year, the Trump campaign has also encouraged his supporters to vote early, which may affect partisan differences between vote modes.",
      "Here are specific details about the mirages we have seen in key swing states in the past \u2014 and what could happen on election night this year.",
      "North Carolina: Most of the mail ballots will likely be reported first, causing a blue mirage. In a change for this year\u2019s election, in-person early ballots cannot be tabulated until after polls close on Election Day. We expect the in-person early votes to start coming in around 8 p.m. ET, a half-hour after polls close in the state. But the vote percentages will shift toward Republicans as in-person Election Day votes get reported over the course of the evening.",
      "Georgia: Most counties will report their early in-person and mail ballots first, likely causing a blue mirage before the statewide results move toward Trump as Election Day votes are reported. After that, there may be a small shift back toward the Democrats, as the late-arriving mail ballots are reported from large metro Atlanta counties. Unlike 2020, Georgia counties are not allowed to pause their vote-counting process until they have counted all ballots.",
      "Pennsylvania: We expect the earliest-reported votes to be dominated by mail ballots, including from heavily Democratic Philadelphia and Allegheny counties, causing an early blue mirage. Then, as in-person Election Day votes are reported, the blue mirage will turn into a red one, with the results tipping more Republican than we expect to see in the final margin. Finally those large counties (particularly Philadelphia) will continue to count and report their remaining mail ballots. This will likely shift the race back in Democrats\u2019 direction.",
      "In 2020, the Pennsylvania results at 3 a.m. ET on election night were about 7 percentage points more Republican than the final result. In the 2022 Senate election, the 3 a.m. red mirage was just over 1 percentage point from the final margin.",
      "Michigan: We expect a slight red mirage in Michigan as smaller, more pro-Republican localities report their votes. The total vote count will likely trickle upward as small places report, and the size of the mirage will shrink when large, Democratic cities like Detroit, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor report. This year, Michigan voters can vote early in person for the first time in a general election, and clerks are now permitted to preprocess their mail ballots, enabling faster counting. Both of these changes may cause differences in vote reporting patterns compared to what we have seen in previous elections.",
      "Wisconsin: In most Wisconsin municipalities, all modes of vote are reported together. This produces a slight red mirage, because smaller, rural municipalities tend to report more quickly.",
      "A handful of large municipalities, including the city of Milwaukee, tabulate their mail ballots centrally and report them separately from their Election Day votes. The state will experience a red mirage until the heavily Democratic mail ballots from most heavily Democratic cities in the state are reported. At 4:42 a.m. ET on election night 2020, Milwaukee reported that Biden had received 85% of its 168,000 mail ballots. This caused Biden\u2019s statewide total to increase from 47.3% to 49.3%.",
      "Arizona: In 2020, about 70% of the state\u2019s votes \u2014 mostly early in-person and early-arriving mail ballots \u2014 were reported in the first hour after polls closed. This generated a statewide Biden lead of over 14 percentage points in a state he ultimately won by 0.3 points.",
      "As Election Day votes were reported in the next few hours of election night, the size of the blue mirage shrunk to about 3.5 points. It continued to shrink after Election Day as the pro-Trump, late-arriving mail ballots were reported. In the 2022 Senate race, the Democrat was ahead in the first hour by 19 points and won by 5. But in the 2018 Senate race, the pattern worked in the opposite direction, with the Republican ahead by 3 points early before ultimately losing by 2 points.",
      "Nevada: Nevada will experience a red mirage until Clark County (Las Vegas) reports. In 2020, Clark\u2019s first report came 90 minutes after the first county in the state had reported its votes. In 2022, this gap was only 10 minutes. Then, the first report in Clark may cause a blue mirage, which will shrink as in-person Election Day votes are tabulated statewide.",
      "Late-arriving mail ballots will be reported in the days after Election Day. In 2020, these ballots moved Biden\u2019s lead from 0.6 percentage points to a final result of 2.4 points."

    "published": "Sat, 02 Nov 2024 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After Donald Trump claimed victory in the early-morning hours after election night in 2020, his campaign and supporters turned to the courts to make that claim a reality. The Trump campaign and surrogates began filing lawsuits the very same day, challenging the results on a variety of grounds well before the final votes were counted.",
      "The legal process and tactics may provide insight into how Trump or his allies could launch similar efforts should he lose again this time.",
      "Over the remainder of November and into December, Trump and his Republican allies filed dozens of lawsuits in key swing states that, if successful, would have given Trump the Electoral College votes needed to remain in the White House. Their efforts stretched from local county courts all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and were supported by solo practitioners and state attorneys general alike.",
      "Of the more than 60 lawsuits filed in the post-election period, Trump obtained a favorable ruling in only one case \u2014 the remainder were eventually either dismissed, settled or voluntarily withdrawn.",
      "Approximately 12 hours after Trump declared victory in a 2 a.m. speech from the White House, the campaign filed lawsuits seeking to stop the counts in Michigan and Georgia. Later that day, a third lawsuit was filed in Pennsylvania seeking to prevent voters from \u201ccuring\u201d mail-in ballots that lacked proof of identification.",
      "More lawsuits from the campaign and Republican allies swiftly followed in those states and other heated battlegrounds. In Arizona, voters and the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit alleging thousands of people in Maricopa County had their ballots disqualified because of ink-bleed caused by Sharpies. In Nevada, Trump electors sued alleging that faulty signature matching machines cast doubt on over 100,000 Clark County mail-in votes. In Wisconsin, Trump filed a lawsuit alleging widespread voter fraud and demanding a recount, which ultimately reaffirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state.",
      "Over the following days and weeks, all these lawsuits ended in losses for Trump, with the exception of his initial lawsuit in Pennsylvania. That resulted in an order finding that the Pennsylvania secretary of state overstepped by extending the deadline for voters to provide missing proof of identification for mail-in ballots received after Election Day and enjoining counties from counting any ballots \u201ccured\u201d during that time. Even with that ruling, Biden still won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.",
      "On Nov. 19, 2020, nearly two weeks after all major media outlets had called the election for Biden, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis held a press conference in Washington, D.C., to present evidence they claimed showed widespread fraud and election interference by foreign countries.",
      "\u201cThe number of voter fraud cases in Philadelphia could fill a library,\u201d Giuliani said.",
      "\u201cWhat we are really dealing with here, and uncovering more by the day, is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States,\u201d Powell said.",
      "Powell\u2019s claims at that press conference went too far even for Trump, who behind the scenes dismissed her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cunhinged,\u201d according to filings in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal election interference case against Trump.",
      "The rate of new lawsuits slowed significantly in December, but Trump and his allies hadn\u2019t given up. One week into the month, Texas sought leave at the U.S. Supreme Court to file a lawsuit against Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin arguing that officials in those states had made illegal changes to election laws and again raising allegations of fraud. Seventeen Republican attorneys general would go on to add their support to Texas\u2019 case. The justices ultimately declined to hear the case, stating that Texas had not shown a \u201cjudicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court, with the exception of justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, never showed any real appetite for taking up other election cases that rose to their level. The justices disposed of a handful of post-election challenges from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin with no further explanation in an order a month after Biden was inaugurated.",
      "\u201cThese cases provide us with an ideal opportunity to address just what authority nonlegislative officials have to set election rules, and to do so well before the next election cycle,\u201d Thomas wrote in a dissent. \u201cThe refusal to do so is inexplicable.\u201d",
      "The legal efforts to keep Trump in power had failed, but the ramifications of these challenges would continue to unfold for their participants over the following years. The federal indictment against Trump mentions these baseless lawsuits as proof of his corrupt intent to remain in power despite knowing he lost the election. Giuliani has been disbarred in New York and D.C., indicted in Georgia and Arizona and has been ordered to turn over his Manhattan apartment and other property to two Georgia election workers he defamed.",
      "Powell and Ellis were indicted in Georgia and have both pleaded guilty. Ellis was also indicted in Arizona and has since agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for her charges being dropped. And dozens of ethics complaints against local attorneys who filed election challenges are still pending nationwide."

    "published": "Thu, 31 Oct 2024 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Some states automatically launch a recount if the results are within a certain margin, while others rely on candidates to ask for one.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 election looks extremely close in the polls. And if the actual results are that close after Election Day, it's possible the results in a key state could hinge on a recount.",
      "The rules about when recounts happen and the procedures they include vary from state to state, since elections are administered locally. Those rules were in the spotlight in 2020, after Joe Biden won a handful of key battleground states by a razor-thin margin.",
      "Former President Donald Trump requested, and was granted, recounts in a few of these states, but none of them changed the outcome of the election there. Typically, recounts only slightly change the final margin of a race, but when the vote is close enough, they can have a real effect.",
      "Ahead of Election Day, here's a refresher of the recount rules in the states expected to be the closest in the presidential race.",
      "Arizona",
      "Candidates don't request recounts in Arizona, but the state requires an automatic recount if a race is decided by a margin within (or equal to) less than 0.5% of votes cast in a race. The threshold was lower in 2020 (0.1%), but since then, the state enacted a law raising the automatic recount threshold to 0.5%.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers approved new measures in 2024 that would shorten the time needed for a potential recount. That means Arizona would be able to handle a recount and not miss the deadline for the December meeting where members of the Electoral College cast their votes.",
      "Georgia",
      "In Georgia, a candidate can request a recount if the margin of a race is within 0.5 percentage points, as long as the request is made within two business days of certification.",
      "Georgia's 2020 presidential vote got significant scrutiny in the days after Election Day, given both the tight margin and Trump's baseless claims of widespread fraud.",
      "Election officials hand-counted nearly 5 million ballots again after the election, as part of a statewide risk-limiting audit authorized by a new state law.",
      "Then, after the state certified Biden's victory, the Trump campaign requested a machine recount, as was its right under state law. (That recount also didn't change the outcome.)",
      "State law also allows election officials to ask for a recount if there is \"a suspected error or discrepancy in the returns,\" and the secretary of state can ask for one if a candidate believes a \"suspected error or discrepancy\" occurred.",
      "Michigan",
      "Michigan law provides for an automatic recount if the margin of victory in a race is 2,000 votes or fewer. A candidate is also allowed to request a recount if they have a \"good-faith belief that but for fraud or mistake, the candidate would have had a reasonable chance of winning,\" according to state law.",
      "The state recently enacted changes to Michigan's recount law, but none will go into effect before Election Day.",
      "Nevada",
      "There's no provision for automatic recounts here, but a candidate can request one, as long as they cover the cost of the recount and make the request within three days of the certification.",
      "North Carolina",
      "A candidate can request a recount in a race if the margin of victory is within 0.5% of votes cast, or 10,000 votes, whichever is less.",
      "Pennsylvania",
      "The state automatically triggers a recount if the margin between two candidates is within 0.5%. But three voters can also request a recount in a specific precinct if they allege there was fraud or an error in that precinct.",
      "Wisconsin",
      "The state allows candidates to request a recount, as Trump did in 2020. But the candidate who requests the recount has to cover the expenses if the margin of victory is larger than 0.25 percentage points, as Trump did when he paid $3 million for a partial recount that resulted in no substantive change to the 2020 vote count."

      "A win in the election he\u2019s dubbed \u201cthe most important\u201c in the history of the country would likely result in the federal criminal cases against him being dismissed, with state criminal cases possibly being frozen until he leaves office and additional delays in the various pending civil cases against him.",
      "A loss to Vice President Kamala Harris, however, could see Trump facing a potential jail sentence later in the month for his criminal conviction in New York and the possibility of additional criminal trials in 2025. It could also leave him open to additional civil trials in the near future, while he\u2019s already appealing $500 million in civil judgments against him.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot more arrows in the quiver when you\u2019re the president,\u201d said NBC News legal analyst Chuck Rosenberg.",
      "Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung predicted Trump would prevail at the ballot box and said all of the cases should be tossed. The \u201cwitch hunts against President Trump have imploded\u201d and \u201cshould all be dismissed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s historic decision on immunity and other vital jurisprudence,\u201d Cheung said in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where the legal cases against the Republican presidential nominee currently stand, and how they may \u2014 or may not \u2014 be affected by a Trump win or loss.",
      "Hush money case",
      "Win or lose, Trump\u2019s biggest immediate challenge after the election is his potential sentencing on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in New York. He is tentatively scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26 \u2014 three weeks after Election Day.",
      "New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan twice postponed the proceeding to give Trump and his attorneys more time to argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s July ruling on the scope of presidential immunity should result in the conviction being thrown out. They also want the charges against Trump either dropped or for him to get a new trial that omits evidence they argue shouldn\u2019t have been allowed in light of the high court\u2019s ruling.",
      "Merchan is supposed to decide on that request by Nov. 12. Trump\u2019s attorneys are expected to immediately appeal if he rules against their client.",
      "If the sentencing proceeds, Merchan could potentially sentence Trump to prison, which would also be immediately appealed. Rosenberg told NBC News in May, after Trump\u2019s conviction, that jail time was unlikely but possible considering the former president spent much of the trial insulting the judge and defying his gag order.",
      "An election victory would give Trump additional fodder for an appeal to stave off jail time; his attorneys have argued in another case that the Constitution bars the president from being restricted from carrying out his official duties.",
      "Federal election interference case",
      "If Trump loses, special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s election interference case is also on the horizon.",
      "The case, which charges Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States for illegally trying to overturn the 2020 election results, was initially slated to go to trial earlier this year but was paused for several months while the Supreme Court weighed Trump\u2019s arguments that he was mostly protected from allegations of wrongdoing because of presidential immunity.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to continue moving forward with the case even if Trump is elected in November, but it\u2019s likely that whoever Trump names to head the Justice Department will fire Smith and scuttle the case.",
      "In an interview last week with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump suggested he might not wait for his new AG. \u201cI would fire him within two seconds,\u201d Trump said, referring to Smith.",
      "Even with Smith out of the picture, the Justice Department would still have to move to have the judge dismiss the case \u2014 a request judges don\u2019t always necessarily grant.",
      "Georgia election interference case",
      "The sprawling case charging Trump and more than a dozen others with illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results is on hold until December when an appeals court will weigh whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office should be allowed to remain on the case.",
      "If she is, that could allow the long-stalled case to proceed. Trump\u2019s loss could pave the way for Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee to set a trial date for the case. However, if Trump loses, he is still likely to appeal the case further, which Willis brought against him in 2023, which could pose more delays.",
      "If Willis and her office are booted from the case, that would cause additional delays as well. The process of finding another prosecutor can be lengthy; it took almost two years to name one in another case involving Willis.",
      "If Trump wins the election, those delays could be even longer. At a court hearing in December of last year, McAfee asked Trump attorney Steve Sadow when his client could stand trial if he\u2019s elected.",
      "\u201cThe answer to that is I believe that under the supremacy clause and his duties as president of the United States, this trial would not take place at all until after he left his term in office,\u201d Sadow replied.",
      "Barbara McQuade, an NBC News legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, said she believes it\u2019s possible both state criminal cases could be stayed during Trump\u2019s time in office and \u201cwould resume upon the expiration of his term.\u201d",
      "Classified documents case",
      "In July, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the criminal case charging Trump with lying and scheming to\u00a0mislead federal investigators\u00a0to retain sensitive classified materials after he left the White House, finding Smith\u2019s appointment as special counsel was illegal.",
      "Smith is appealing the decision, arguing that there\u2019s plentiful precedent for his appointment and that the case should be allowed to proceed.",
      "As with the federal election case, Smith\u2019s office is expected to proceed with business as usual in the appeal even if Trump is elected, although the special counsel\u2019s office would likely be quickly shut down and the appeal dropped.",
      "E. Jean Carroll appeals",
      "Cases that likely won\u2019t be affected by a Trump win or loss are his pending appeals of civil judgments against him totaling more than  $500 million.",
      "The former president is appealing the largest award \u2014 more than $478 million and growing by more than $111,000 a day \u2014 in a civil fraud case in New York state court. During arguments before the state Appellate Division, three members of the five-judge panel indicated they thought the award was too large.",
      "A lawyer for the state attorney general\u2019s office argued that the award is appropriate because the amount of fraud Trump and his company were found responsible for was sizable and went on for an extended period of time.",
      "It\u2019s unclear when the panel will rule.",
      "Trump is also appealing a pair of jury awards totaling about $88 million that he has to pay writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Carroll filed two suits against Trump, one for allegedly sexually assaulting her in the 1990s and defamation and another for defaming her while he was president.",
      "The appeals court is expected to rule in the sexual assault case first, and that ruling could come at any time.",
      "Jan. 6 suits",
      "Trump is facing eight pending\u00a0civil suits\u00a0related to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including by injured police officers. Similar to the criminal cases, Trump has argued that his actions were protected by presidential immunity.",
      "A federal appeals court allowed the cases to proceed last year after the plaintiffs contended that Trump\u2019s actions weren\u2019t official presidential acts because he was acting as a candidate for the office.",
      "Trump, they noted, would have the opportunity to push back on that stance as the case proceeds.",
      "No trial date has been set in the cases, and with the likelihood of appeals the immunity issues could take months or longer to be determined.",
      "The process could become even more drawn out if Trump wins, because he could attempt to get the Justice Department involved in his defense. He could also try to delay trials in those cases by arguing that they should come after his criminal trial in Georgia, since they cover similar ground and could affect his right against self-incrimination.",
      "\u201cCivil cases are often stayed for that reason,\u201d McQuade said.",
      "\u2018Exonerated 5\u2019 suit",
      "Trump is facing another defamation suit brought against him this month by members of the so-called Central Park Five, who now call themselves the Exonerated Five.",
      "During last month\u2019s presidential debate, Trump incorrectly said that the men, who are Black and Latino, pleaded guilty in a criminal case in which they\u2019d been charged with assaulting and raping a white woman jogging in New York\u2019s Central Park in 1989. He also said they \u201ckilled a person ultimately\u201d although the woman is still alive.",
      "The five, who were teenagers when they were convicted, said they were coerced into confessions by police, and pleaded not guilty to the charges. They were convicted at trial and served lengthy prison sentences while maintaining their innocence.",
      "They were exonerated in 2002 after a review by prosecutors that included DNA evidence that found the jogger had been attacked by a serial rapist who confessed to the crime after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "That suit is not expected to be affected by Trump\u2019s election given a Supreme Court ruling during the Clinton years that presidents aren\u2019t immune from civil suits that aren\u2019t related to their time in office.",
      "McQuade said she believes the case \u201ccould proceed, just as the Paula Jones case did against Bill Clinton.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The task of counting and announcing vote results from over 100,000 precincts across the country \u2014 mostly within a few hours \u2014 requires a massive operation that involves hundreds of thousands of poll workers, election officials and observers.",
      "We may think of a presidential election as a single nationwide contest, but how elections are administered varies across the 50 states and Washington, D.C. Even within states, different jurisdictions \u2014 counties, cities and so on \u2014 could have different\u00a0administrative practices or logistics in the election process.",
      "In most of the country, counties run elections. In a handful of states, particularly in New England, cities or towns administer them.",
      "Nearly all of those jurisdictions provide multiple vote reports (updates to the vote count) on election night and in the following days. In the November 2020 election, NBC News received over 88,000 updates to its vote totals across 542 different races. More than 45,000 of those vote updates came before 2 a.m. ET on election night.",
      "From 9:15 to 9:30 p.m. ET that night, NBC News received just over four updates per second, on average.",
      "In all, NBC News will report vote results from 4,635 jurisdictions across the U.S. Here\u2019s how it works, from how local governments count to how NBC News monitors, checks and displays the vote totals.",
      "How do states and counties tabulate their vote results?",
      "The vote results reported by NBC News are the product of hundreds of thousands of people working to accurately and efficiently count and report the results. The process begins at your local polling place or precinct. On Election Day 2020, there were over 107,000 physical polling places nationwide, staffed by nearly 700,000 poll workers, many of them volunteers.",

      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
      "After polls close in your state and the last voters have cast their ballots, poll workers begin to close the precincts and tabulate the votes. Each state has different requirements for the process, but the steps generally include turning off and securing voting machines and ensuring that the number of voters who checked in corresponds with the number of ballots cast.",
      "Then, each precinct tabulates its vote results and reports those numbers to a central office in its county or town.",
      "In some states, local precincts also count mail ballots from voters who live inside the boundaries of those precincts. Poll workers must scan them through tabulation machines either on Election Day, perhaps while the precincts are not busy, or after polls have closed.",
      "In other places, mail ballots are counted centrally in a jurisdiction\u2019s single facility instead of precinct by precinct. Some of those counties, such as Clark County, Nevada (home of Las Vegas), and Maricopa County, Arizona (home of Phoenix), provide partial reports at regular intervals. Others do not report any mail results until they have tabulated all the mail ballots.",
      "For example, Milwaukee County in Wisconsin released its full tabulation of about 170,000 mail ballots at 4:40 a.m. ET on election night 2020, after it had worked its way through the whole batch.",
      "How does NBC News receive and display counties\u2019 vote tabulations?",
      "In November, NBC News is covering 610 statewide and congressional races. To manage the task of collecting all those results in a relatively short amount of time, NBC News coordinates with ABC News, CBS News and CNN through the National Election Pool, or NEP. Since 2018, the NEP has received vote count data from Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data.",
      "No centralized, federal government agency collects and reports vote results, so each state determines how it makes\u00a0those results available. Many states have websites where anybody can access the real-time vote counts. Others have websites with results \u2014 but the numbers on election night are not as up to date as what is available from individual counties.",
      "And some states do not have vote results pages that update on election night at all.",
      "Edison Research collects the vote results state by state and county by county. When possible, it uses software to automatically detect updates and collect the vote counts from state or county websites. In other jurisdictions, Edison manually transcribes vote result data from PDFs into its tabulation system.",
      "And because many jurisdictions do not post their results online on election night but the results themselves are public information, Edison also hires thousands of \u201cvote reporters\u201d to physically be at county or town election offices where they can get the totals after votes are tabulated.",
      "After Edison processes the data, it is transmitted to NBC News and the rest of the NEP. That is when you will see vote numbers change on a television graphic or on NBCNews.com. That is also when NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk sees the updated vote count and uses it in its process of determining when it can accurately project the winner of a race.",
      "How does NBC News ensure the vote counts are correct?",
      "Given the high volume of data being reported in a fairly short amount of time, it is not hard to imagine that mistakes can be made. Any process that involves hundreds of thousands of people transmitting millions of numbers has the potential for human-generated error from poor handwriting, typos, miscommunications and so forth.",
      "What makes election results in this country trustworthy, however, are the countless fail-safes that detect and correct such mistakes.",
      "The biggest of those fail-safes is vote certification. The results you see on election night are only unofficial counts, and they can change \u2014 typically by tiny amounts, like when overseas and military ballots are added to vote counts or when a state conducts a recount in a close race and re-examines disputed ballots. Only when a state certifies the results, which happens days or even weeks after Election Day, do they become final. And before certification, states require several postelection audit procedures, which double- and triple-check the accuracy of the counts.",
      "On election night, there are other error-detection fail-safes at every stage of the vote counting process. They begin at the local precincts, where poll workers make sure that the \u201cbooks balance\u201d by verifying, for example, that the number of ballots cast in the precincts correspond with the number of voter check-ins.",
      "Then, when a precinct reports its vote results to its state or county, it performs additional quality assurance checks. Does the number of votes in the precinct make sense when compared with its number of registered voters? Is the turnout rate comparable to the rates in nearby precincts? If any of those questions raise flags about a precinct\u2019s count, the state or the county will resolve the concerns by consulting with the person in charge of the precinct or by re-checking the data before those votes are added to the county\u2019s overall count.",
      "Edison Research performs another set of data quality checks when it receives vote results. It looks for errors, like extra digits added to a candidate\u2019s count or vote counts for two candidates getting flipped accidentally. If Edison\u2019s error detection system suspects a report may include a mistake, the data gets held\u00a0until a trained analyst can verify it with the state or the county.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 15:01:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Several key states are perennially slow vote counters. Others have invested in speeding up the process. But if it\u2019s a very close race, don\u2019t expect a quick resolution.",
    "story": [
      "Americans have two big questions as they head into another election with a deeply divided electorate: who will win, and when will they know it?",
      "In 2020, election week replaced election night: Joe Biden wasn\u2019t declared the winner until Saturday. This year, it could go either way. It may take as long as a week for the NBC News Decision Desk to project a presidential winner, or it could happen as early as Wednesday, even by Wednesday morning.",
      "The truth is the Decision Desk cannot know until election night which scenario will unfold, regardless of how carefully we have analyzed the polls, early vote, and other election-related data. The answer depends not only on how states count their votes but on the unknowable factor of how close the margins will be.",
      "One thing is clear: The days of projecting a winner on election night itself are almost certainly over.",

      "How exit polls work and how NBC News uses them on election night",
      "Projecting a presidential winner as early as Wednesday would require that the key battleground states, particularly Pennsylvania, are not essentially tied. There would need to be a large enough spread between the first and second place to be able to project a winner.Races that are nearly tied, like the presidential race in Georgia and Arizona in 2020 (Joe Biden\u2019s winning margins in these states were 11,779 and 10,457 votes, respectively), require essentially all the vote to be counted before NBC News\u2019 Decision Desk can project a winner. This can take days.",
      "But let\u2019s go through the battleground states where Wednesday calls are at least possible.",
      "Any path to winning the White House will likely go through the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. In 2020, Pennsylvania was the pivotal Electoral College state to call the presidency, and there is a decent chance it plays that role again. But in 2020, it took four days after Election Day for the NBC News Decision Desk to be able to declare a winner.",
      "It may well happen much earlier this year. This is because 98% to 99% of the vote in Pennsylvania will likely be counted by Wednesday morning.",
      "How Pennsylvania counts its vote remains largely unchanged since 2020, but the process should be more efficient this year. Key counties like Allegheny (home of Pittsburgh) and Philadelphia have invested heavily in new voting machines and have added more personnel to help process ballots. Also, remember that this election is not being administered amid a global pandemic that required strict social distancing between election officials, slowing the count.",
      "We expect several Pennsylvania counties to release large counts of early votes shortly after polls close, followed by the in-person Election Day vote. That would leave the early votes received on Election Day, along with provisional ballots, still to count on Wednesday.",
      "If 99% of the total vote is counted quickly, a Wednesday projection is very possible in Pennsylvania, unless the race is razor tight. In 2022, we had about 90% of the vote counted in Pennsylvania when the NBC News Decision Desk projected Democrat John Fetterman as the winner of the state\u2019s Senate race at 12:51 a.m. ET.",
      "In Wisconsin and Michigan, the bulk of the vote could also be counted by Wednesday if past reporting patterns hold.Based on those patterns, in Wisconsin, the amount counted by Wednesday morning should be over 99%. In Michigan, it should be more than 95%. An important note in Michigan: For the first time, municipalities with more than 5,000 residents can begin pre-processing absentee ballots \u2014 opening envelopes, verifying voter signatures and so on \u2014 several days before the election, which could lead to more efficient counting on election night.",
      "On the other hand, the introduction of early in-person voting in Michigan could add some difficulty in quickly counting the vote. Regardless of these changes, both Michigan and Wisconsin count almost all of their votes quickly. So, unless the races are extremely close, there is a decent chance the NBC News Decision Desk would be able to make a projection sometime on Wednesday.",
      "If the races are that close, however, it could take days or perhaps even a week, depending on the margins.",
      "How the Sun Belt battlegrounds count their votes",
      "Outside of the blue wall, the critical swing states of Georgia and North Carolina are among the best in the nation when it comes to efficiently processing and counting their votes.",
      "These two states are also extremely good at making their data available to the public electronically. In Georgia, over 99% of the vote will be counted on election night. In fact, almost all the vote has been counted in recent past elections by 1 a.m. ET. However, Georgia was so close in 2020 that it took days to call the race.",
      "North Carolina has a similar pattern in how it reports out the vote, with 99% of the vote counted by midnight in past elections. Still, any chance of an election night projection in either of these closely divided states depends on a wide enough spread between the two candidates.",
      "The one electoral vote awarded to the winner in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District could also be pivotal in the path to 270. With no significant changes in how votes are counted in Nebraska, around 90% of the vote can be expected to be counted by Wednesday morning, which again could lead to a projection if there is enough spread between the candidates.",
      "The last two battleground states, Arizona and Nevada, almost certainly won\u2019t be called quickly. If the presidency comes down to one of these states, forget any thoughts of a Wednesday resolution.",
      "In 2020, NBC News did not project a winner in Arizona until Nov. 12, nine days after Election Day. And unlike some other close states, it wasn\u2019t just because the margin was so thin.",
      "Typically, Arizona has as much as 20% of its vote still to count after election night \u2014mainly late-arriving mail ballots. And there are very substantial differences between Republicans and Democrats in terms of who votes when (early versus on Election Day). This makes it nearly impossible to project a winner in Arizona on election night.",
      "Nevada is a state that has a large amount of early voting, both absentee and in person, that is not counted on election night. In the past, nearly a quarter of the vote is still not counted by the Wednesday morning after Election Day.",
      "Given that the state has been historically close in presidential elections, the probability of calling a close race with a large amount of uncounted vote is very low.",
      "The bottom line: In Arizona and Nevada, it will likely take a few days, perhaps longer, to know the winner."

    "published": "Wed, 30 Oct 2024 13:29:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Exit polls, large-scale studies of voters, now include phone calls to early and mail voters as well as interviews outside polling places on Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "On Election Day, as votes are being tallied and news organizations await results and race projections that can be reported, exit polls are a critical tool providing an early look at who is voting and what\u2019s motivating their choices.",
      "An exit poll is a survey of voters taken as they leave (or exit) their voting location. It\u2019s the only national survey of known voters in the country. It allows news organizations, researchers and voters to understand what\u2019s happening in an election as the results flow in.",
      "Here\u2019s how exit polling works, where they are conducted and how NBC News will be using the exit poll results on election night and the days after.",
      "Who conducts the exit poll?",
      "Since 2003, Edison Research, a firm that specializes in collecting election data, has conducted exit polls on behalf of the National Election Pool. The NEP is a consortium of media networks \u2014 ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC News \u2014 that pools together resources for one collective vote count and exit poll operation. NBC News independently analyzes and reports on the exit poll results.",

      "Inside NBC News' Decision Desk: When will we know who won the presidential race?",
      "What questions are asked?",
      "The exit poll asks voters which candidates they supported for president and in other races. But a number of other attitudinal and issue-based questions are usually included, such as: \u201cWhat is the most important issue to your vote?\u201d The other key component of an exit poll is asking about a voter\u2019s demographics such as age, gender, race, education. These types of questions help illustrate how different groups voted and what mattered to them, and they are also used to weight the exit poll \u2014 that is, to make sure that the exit poll properly reflects the demographic composition of the electorate as well as the election results.",
      "Members of each news organization in the NEP jointly determine in which states the exit polls will be conducted (in addition to the national exit poll survey), and they work together to decide what questions are included on the national and state questionnaires. The exit poll questionnaires include about 25 questions and take around 5 minutes to complete.",
      "How are exit polls conducted?",
      "The exit poll is then conducted in a random sample of selected polling places across the country and in states with their own exit polls (more on that later). At least one interviewer is assigned to each polling place on Election Day. This year, interviewers will be stationed at 600 polling locations throughout the country, with each of them following local rules about where they can stand in relation to the polling location. The interview is self-administered, meaning the respondent fills out the survey on their own. Then, the interviewers call in their results throughout the day, and the results are reported to news organizations.",
      "What about state exit polls?",
      "In addition to a national exit poll, which captures voters across the country, there are exit polls specifically for states that are pivotal to winning the presidency or include important down-ballot races, such as Senate or governor. This year, NBC News will have coverage of state exit polls in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. The exit poll will be conducted in 40 balloting locations in each state.",
      "How does the exit poll capture the growing percentage of people voting early or by mail?",
      "The exit poll supplements in-person Election Day interviews by contacting early voters through a telephone poll of people on voter lists in all 50 states, as well as by collecting interviews during early in-person voting periods.",
      "This year, the exit poll is conducting interviews at early in-person voting locations in Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio. All voters in a given state, regardless of whether they vote early or on Election Day, are asked the same questions.",
      "Are exit polls anonymous?",
      "Yes. In person, voters are handed a piece of paper and pencil to fill out a paper questionnaire and they answer anonymously. When they are done, they put their folded questionnaire into a box, much like casting a ballot. Interviews conducted by telephone do not retain any personal information about the voter who was interviewed.",
      "How many people are interviewed?",
      "The national exit poll will include approximately 20,000 interviews in total, including in-person on Election Day, in-person during early voting and via telephone to capture other early voters, including those who cast their ballots by mail. For each state exit poll in Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, there will be sample sizes of 1,500 to 2,500 respondents per state.",
      "How do we use exit polls?",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk uses some exit poll data to help project election results. However, the exit poll is primarily used as a reporting tool on election night.",
      "The data gives viewers and readers a look into what issues are motivating voters, how they feel about the country and who they are. It\u2019s the nation\u2019s first look into what the electorate looks like and how voters are feeling about the election, the candidates and their choices.",
      "What data do news organizations report and when?",
      "Participants in the NEP do not report any exit poll results before 5 p.m. ET on Election Day, and no exit poll results that can be indicative of the outcome of a race get reported until after all the polls are scheduled to close in a state. As election night goes on and interviewers on the ground call in more exit poll results, the data is updated and re-weighed in real time."

      "Getting on the voter roll",
      "Georgia asks for quite a bit of information to register as a voter: name, address, date of birth and either the number on your driver\u2019s license or state ID if you have one, or the last four digits of your Social Security number if you don\u2019t. Sign the form swearing \u2014 under penalty of perjury \u2014 that you\u2019re a citizen and eligible to vote, and you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Election officials will then check your information against government databases, which typically verify your identity and citizenship. If officials can\u2019t find corroborating information, you\u2019ll be asked to prove your citizenship with a passport, birth certificate, naturalization certificate or similar document before you are fully registered to vote.",
      "Staying on the roll",
      "Georgia checks its voter rolls against lists of people who have died or been convicted of a felony, while also routinely checking in with voters who change their address with the U.S. Postal Service or cancel their Georgia driver\u2019s license.",
      "They also use the interstate Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) to find voters who die elsewhere, or move and register out of state.",
      "Casting a ballot",
      "You must show a photo ID to vote. If you choose to vote by mail, you\u2019ll have to request a ballot with your driver\u2019s license number or a photocopy of your photo ID.",
      "All ballots are fed into tabulators to be tallied, totals are reconciled (ensuring that there are an equal number of both ballots cast and voters who voted) and the results are driven to the county election office.",
      "Checking the count",
      "After the results are tallied, the state conducts a risk-limiting audit by physically counting randomly selected batches of ballots and hand-counting them. The state also runs all the ballot images through a computer program that tallies the results."

    "story": [
      "Voters across the country are set to decide on nearly 150 ballot measures next week that will shape the future of a wide variety of policy issues in their states.",
      "Constitutional amendments related to abortion rights have drawn the most national attention in an election year that has otherwise been dominated by the presidential race.",
      "But ballot measures in dozens of other states will also put decisions about how to handle marijuana regulations, voting procedures, economic issues and immigration laws directly in the hands of voters.",
      "\u201cThe major trends that we\u2019re seeing in 2024 are reproductive freedom, democracy and economic justice,\u201d said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works with progressive organizations to help advance citizen-led ballot measures.",
      "Follow live updates on the 2024 election",
      "According to her group, there are 147 ballot measures on ballots next Tuesday in 41 states. Of those, 77 were referred to the ballot by state lawmakers, while 57 were initiated by citizens. The others are considered bond proposals, advisory questions and constitutional convention questions. (In addition, Louisiana will let voters decide on four constitutional amendments on its Dec. 7 ballot.)",
      "Here's a rundown of the various issues the proposed amendments seek to address.",
      "Abortion",
      "Constitutional amendments to expand or protect abortion access will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the presidential battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada and the Senate battlegrounds of Montana and Florida.",
      "\u201cEveryone knows this is a big issue this year \u2014 it\u2019s the most we\u2019ve ever seen for reproductive freedom ballot measures in history,\u201d Fields Figueredo said.",
      "In Arizona, Florida, Missouri and South Dakota, proposed amendments would effectively protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with some exceptions that differ in each state after that point, and undo existing abortion laws on the books.",
      "In Maryland, Montana, Nevada and New York, abortion is already legal through fetal viability, and in Colorado, there are no laws restricting abortion and no gestational limits for women seeking abortions. As a result, the proposals in those states are intended to formally enshrine those existing rights, which organizers have said is designed to prevent lawmakers from undoing them in the future.",
      "Nebraska is the only state where two dueling constitutional amendments will appear on the November ballot.",
      "One measure would amend the state constitution to protect abortion rights until fetal viability, with exceptions for the life and health of the woman after that.",
      "The other would protect abortion rights in the first trimester, but it would bar the procedure in the second and third trimesters, except in medical emergencies or when pregnancies are the result of sexual assaults or incest. Passage would effectively codify the state's existing law banning abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions, in the state constitution.",
      "Voting and elections",
      "There are 39 ballot measures on the November ballot related to democracy, elections and voting procedures, according to the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center.",
      "Some seek to create or further tighten voting restrictions, while others seek to broaden access.",
      "For example, eight states \u2014 Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin \u2014 will have constitutional amendments, referred to the November ballot by Republican lawmakers, designed to make it clear that only American citizens can vote in elections in those states. It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections in each of those states and at the federal level, and it rarely happens. Election experts have warned that the measures amount to an effort by Republicans to drive the unsubstantiated narrative that noncitizens are voting in large numbers.",
      "In Nevada, a constitutional amendment on the ballot would require people to show identification when they vote in person. Under state rules, voters would need to pass it in two consecutive elections for it to take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, at least three states will have measures on their ballots that would make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. A proposal in Arizona would raise signature requirements for citizen-led constitutional amendments to include 15% of registered voters in each of the state\u2019s 30 legislative districts, while another would allow any person to contest an initiative or proposed amendment in court after it has been filed.",
      "A proposal in North Dakota would require any ballot initiative to be solely about one subject and constitutional amendments to be passed in both the primary and general elections to take effect.",
      "In addition, ballot measures in a handful of other states will let voters decide about implementing open primaries, as well as ranked-choice voting, in some elections.",
      "Marijuana",
      "Nearly half the states have already legalized use of recreational or medical marijuana. Voters in four more states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 will decide next week whether to join them.",
      "A ballot measure in Florida will let voters decide whether to make recreational weed \u2014 sold at designated dispensaries \u2014 legal for everyone over 21. Medical marijuana is already legal in Florida.",
      "In Nebraska, where the use of all marijuana remains illegal, a pair of measures would legalize and regulate the use and sale of medical marijuana.",
      "And in North Dakota and South Dakota, where marijuana is legal for medical purposes, voters will decide on whether to legalize its use recreationally.",
      "Immigration",
      "Arizona is the only state with an immigration-related measure on the ballot this year \u2014 and the stakes are big.",
      "Arizona\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature referred a controversial immigration policy to the ballot that would increase the use of a federal database to check employment eligibility and give state and local law enforcement agencies the authority to detain and deport undocumented border crossers, despite court rulings that have established that that power belongs to the federal government.",
      "Democrats and progressive groups have described the measure as effectively resurrecting controversial 2010 anti-illegal immigration legislation. And voting rights groups have argued it is designed to galvanize conservative turnout and counter enthusiasm for the state\u2019s abortion rights proposal.",
      "Economy and crime",
      "Several states will also allow voters to decide on an array of proposals related to economic issues and crime.",
      "California voters will be asked whether they approve of gradually raising the state\u2019s minimum wage to $18 per hour, while voters in Alaska and Missouri will be asked whether they approve of gradually raising it to $15 per hour.",
      "In Arizona, voters will decide on a constitutional amendment that would effectively revise the rules for a minimum wage for tipped workers.",
      "In Colorado, voters will decide on a list of amendments that would cap property tax revenues for local districts, while voters in Washington state will decide whether state employees may opt out of coverage of various insurance programs.",
      "And in California, voters will determine the fate of a ballot measure that would raise criminal penalties for many drug-related crimes."

    "summary": "Secret audio, overturned convictions and a jail death: The legal saga of an art dealer\u2019s murder",
    "story": [
      "INDIO, Calif. \u2014\u00a0For people who were close to Cliff Lambert, the still-unresolved legal saga surrounding his brutal killing more than a decade ago has been agonizing.",
      "Lambert, a retired art dealer described by a friend as a \u201crich, gay socialite\u201d in the California desert city of Palm Springs, was fatally stabbed in 2008 in what prosecutors have described as an elaborate plot orchestrated by two grifters \u2014 one who posed as an exiled prince from Nepal and the other who once captured media attention when he accused a prominent San Francisco financier of sexual abuse.",
      "With four accomplices, prosecutors have said, Kaushal Niroula and Daniel Garcia took Lambert\u2019s money, identity and life.",
      "A series of arrests, trials and convictions for murder and other crimes followed. But nearly 16 years after Lambert\u2019s murder, the case remains unfinished.",
      "In 2020, four murder convictions were overturned after illegally recorded courtroom audio revealed that the judge in the proceedings made derogatory and biased comments about two defendants, including remarks suggesting that he hadn\u2019t reviewed filings because of Niroula\u2019s sexual orientation and HIV status.",
      "After a new round of trials that ended in October 2023, all three of the surviving defendants were convicted again. (Niroula was fatally assaulted in jail while awaiting a new trial; two defendants previously pleaded guilty, and their convictions weren\u2019t overturned.) But amid claims of ineffective lawyering, health problems and other issues, two of those defendants \u2014 including Garcia, whom prosecutors have described as the plot\u2019s \u201cidea man\u201d \u2014 haven\u2019t yet been sentenced.",
      "The delays have stoked frustration, anger and charges of bias among Lambert\u2019s friends.",
      "\u201cIf Cliff\u2019s family had a ton of females crying in the courtroom and all that, you bet your ass this would have been over,\u201d said Eddie Mullikin, a friend who was a witness at both trials and spoke exclusively to NBC News. \u201cI think this would have been different if this was a straight person with a straight family.\u201d",
      "\"We need some closure on this,\u201d said another friend, Steven Kilkullen, 59. \u201cWe need to see these terrible people receive their punishment. We need to see them pay for what they did to Cliff.\u201d",
      "A court spokesperson for Riverside County Superior Court Judge Anthony Villalobos, who is presiding over the case, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for the Riverside County District Attorney\u2019s Office wouldn\u2019t comment. Lawyers for the defendants didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "At an Oct. 11 court hearing for Garcia, 42, and another defendant, David Replogle, 75, the judge agreed to push sentencing back again, this time to November. A prosecutor objected, saying the government couldn\u2019t agree to further delays, but the judge responded: \u201cI\u2019m trying to make sure that Mr. Garcia gets all of his rights.\u201d",
      "A self-made success",
      "Lambert, 74, was originally from the Midwest, and by the time Kilkullen met him in the mid-\u201990s, he\u2019d become wealthy by developing a process for duplicating master artworks, his friend recalled. Lambert was theatrical and gregarious and a celebrity of his own making \u2014 someone who\u2019d come from nothing and become well-known in the art world, Kilkullen said.",
      "Mullikin met Lambert while he was working as a go-go dancer after he arrived in Palm Springs in the mid-2000s with a plan to stay sober. To him, Lambert was a role model because he was a successful gay man who hadn\u2019t died from HIV/AIDS and offered sincere friendship, Mullikin said.",
      "\u201cIt was just a really stunning example of a good friend,\u201d said Mullikin, 55.",
      "Lambert was also lonely. After the sudden death of his partner, he created an online dating profile, according to Robert Hightower, the former Riverside County prosecutor who tried Lambert\u2019s killers the second time. That\u2019s how Lambert met Garcia, then in his mid-20s, and he flew him to Palm Springs in spring 2008, an appeals decision in the case shows.",
      "Mullikin, who met Garcia during the visit, recalled that he seemed like a nice kid who was looking for someone to fund his business.",
      "The realization of what Garcia was really after \u2014\u00a0an investor, not a romantic partner \u2014 prompted Lambert to throw him out, Hightower told the jury last year. Enraged, Garcia stole Lambert\u2019s credit card and upgraded his airline ticket to first-class, Hightower said. Then, he and Niroula began developing a plot to defraud and murder Lambert, the prosecutor said.",
      "A high-profile sex abuse case",
      "Garcia and Niroula had met at a San Francisco bar a few years before, after Niroula saw a magazine story about a lawsuit Garcia filed in 2002 against financier Thomas White, Garcia\u2019s cousin told \u201cDateline.\u201d A separate suit filed the next year in federal court by nearly two dozen young men and boys in Mexico also accused White of sexual abuse.",
      "All of the litigation was handled by a San Francisco lawyer \u2014 David Replogle.",
      "White maintained that the claims were false, but he settled both actions, paying Garcia and another plaintiff $500,000, according to a lawsuit White filed in 2013 related to the allegations. The suit, which didn\u2019t say how much White paid the Mexican plaintiffs, alleges that he was coerced into making the settlements. The plaintiffs and their legal team carried out an \u201corchestrated fraud\u201d to extort him, his suit alleged.",
      "At least four of the 22 boys who accused him had recanted their statements, and one said he\u2019d been paid to fabricate the claim, according to White\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "Garcia hasn\u2019t recanted his account. In a filing the following year, his attorney said White was \u201cengaged in an unrelenting vendetta\u201d against him and accused White of libel.",
      "White, who was imprisoned in Mexico in connection with the allegations, died in custody after he filed the 2013 lawsuit, according to one of his former lawyers, Stuart Hanlon.",
      "Always 'over the top'",
      "Hightower described Niroula as an \u201cexceptionally charming\u201d personality \u2014 someone who falsely claimed to be a prince and liked to appear as a high roller. Tyson Wrensch, who recalled meeting Niroula and Garcia in San Francisco\u2019s Castro neighborhood after his settlement with White, told \u201cDateline\u201d that the pair would arrive in three Lincoln Town Cars to make it appear like \u201ca Secret Service kinda thing.\u201d",
      "Niroula \u201cwould go to the bar and throw down hundreds and buy everybody a drink,\u201d Wrensch said. \u201cEverything was over the top.\u201d",
      "At one point after Niroula and Garcia embarked on the plan to kill Lambert, Niroula texted Garcia: \u201cHoney, everyone believes me until they have been conned,\u201d according to the appeals decision. \u201cSome even after that.\u201d",
      "To help defraud Lambert, they enlisted Garcia\u2019s lawyer from the sex abuse case \u2014 Replogle \u2014 and a Coachella Valley man whom Niroula had a brief relationship with, Hightower said. To carry out the killing, Niroula also recruited a San Francisco bartender and a former cook in the Marines who was the bartender\u2019s roommate, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In November 2008, Niroula \u2014 posing as a lawyer acting on behalf of a deceased art collector and friend of Lambert\u2019s \u2014 called Lambert and said the collector had left him some artwork, according to the appeals decision. All Lambert needed to do was sign documents to get it, the decision says.",
      "\"Cliff Lambert believed it,\u201d Hightower told the jury.",
      "On Dec. 5, while they were having cocktails with Lambert in his home, Niroula let the bartender and the cook in through the kitchen, Hightower said. They fatally stabbed Lambert, rolled him up in a rug and loaded his body into the trunk of his Mercedes, Hightower said.",
      "On their way to the Bay Area, the prosecutor said, they buried Lambert in a shallow grave on a mountain pass north of Los Angeles.",
      "The unraveling",
      "In the weeks after Lambert\u2019s death, the group fabricated powers of attorney in Lambert\u2019s name, drained roughly $200,000 from his bank account and met with a pair of real estate agents in an effort to sell his home, the prosecutor said.",
      "But by January, the conspiracy had begun to unravel after the bartender returned with a moving truck. He was arrested after concerned neighbors dialed Palm Springs police, Hightower said.",
      "Within months, the others had been arrested. Four of them, including Niroula and Garcia, were charged with murder, conspiracy, grand theft and other crimes, court records show.",
      "The former cook confessed to the killing and cooperated with authorities, Hightower said. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 25 years, records show. The sixth suspect pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to five years in prison. (He was later released and died in 2021, public records show.)",
      "The four others were convicted of murder at separate trials in 2011 and 2012. They were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "But in less than a decade, those verdicts and prison terms were thrown out after Niroula made an explosive series of claims in an appeal and other post-conviction filings.",
      "The allegations were linked to secret recordings made on Garcia\u2019s courtroom laptop that captured off-the-record conversations between Judge David Downing and his clerk.",
      "In a comment detailed in a 2016 petition that sought to overturn Niroula\u2019s conviction, Downing\u2019s clerk said the defendant \u201clikes licking envelopes\u201d and noted Niroula\u2019s HIV-positive status. The judge responded: \u201cEwww lord knows where his tongue has been and for that very reason I don\u2019t like to touch or read anything he gives me and I deny everything as I don\u2019t read it. It\u2019s a tough world folks,\u201d the petition says.",
      "In another comment, the petition says, Downing used an expletive to describe the defendants and said they \u201ccan file anything they want, but I won\u2019t grant any important motions. I have given them just enough money so no court will believe I was biased but besides that let the DA hang them.\u201d",
      "During a private meeting with Garcia at which the defendant confronted the judge about the recordings, Downing said he was protected by the First Amendment and had treated everyone in the case appropriately, according to the appeals decision.",
      "Downing\u2019s California law license has been listed as inactive since 2013, state records show. A message left on a phone number listed under his name wasn\u2019t returned.",
      "On May 15, 2020, the Riverside County prosecutor\u2019s office said it didn\u2019t oppose new trials to \u201cprevent even an appearance of impropriety,\u201d case filings show. Less than a month later, a judge overturned the four murder convictions and set the cases for retrial.",
      "To Mullikin, who had reported Lambert missing and testified at the trial, the entire experience of dealing with his friend\u2019s murder and its aftermath was surreal and overwhelming \u2014 like \u201ca nightmare soap opera,\u201d he said.",
      "When he learned why the convictions were reversed, Mullikin said, he wasn\u2019t angry at the judge \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a gay man in the United States; we are insulted, f\u2014-- with and, our entire lives, you learn to just move past these people,\u201d he said \u2014 and he didn\u2019t believe Downing\u2019s comments exonerated the defendants.",
      "\"That doesn\u2019t excuse you from this,\u201d Mullikin said. \u201cYou still murdered my friend.\u201d",
      "Where the cases stand",
      "On Sept. 6, 2022, while he was awaiting retrial at a Riverside County jail, Niroula was beaten and strangled to death by another inmate, according to a wrongful death lawsuit Niroula\u2019s family filed last year. The suit accuses the county sheriff\u2019s office of allowing Niroula \u2014 who at the time of the killing identified as a transgender woman, according to the suit \u2014 to be preyed upon by a man officials understood to be a violent predator.",
      "The sheriff\u2019s office denied the allegations, a filing shows, and the case is ongoing.",
      "In 2022, Replogle was retried and convicted of murder and other crimes. The next year, the bartender\u2019s retrial also ended with a guilty verdict, as did Garcia\u2019s retrial four months later. Yet only the bartender has been sentenced. Last November, he was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.",
      "The delays in sentencing Garcia and Replogle stem in part from their legal representation. Since their convictions, both defendants have parted ways with the lawyers who represented them at trial, and at the Oct. 11 hearing, Replogle sought to have a newly appointed attorney thrown off the case over what he described as \u201ca conflict.\u201d",
      "Villalobos, the judge, denied the request, saying it had taken a long time to find the new lawyer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be no more playing games,\u201d he said.",
      "Garcia, meanwhile, initially sought to represent himself but then requested a new lawyer. A representative for that attorney appeared at the Oct. 11 hearing and reported having obtained only half of the 11,000 pages of transcripts from Garcia\u2019s second trial.",
      "In court hearings and filings, Garcia has raised other issues, as well, including that he hasn\u2019t been provided accommodations compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In a 2022 petition, Garcia said he has a rare genetic disorder that causes extreme sensitivity to sunlight.",
      "That and other matters would be discussed at a Nov. 13 hearing, the judge said last month.",
      "Lambert\u2019s friend Kilkullen remains baffled that the judge keeps delaying the sentencing hearings.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand for the life of me: Why is he giving more time?\u201d Kilkullen said. \u201cI personally am ready for this closure, and I need to know that the court places value on Cliff\u2019s life, on Cliff as a human being, on the experience that he went through with these people. I am tired of feeling like the court values these criminals more than the person that they did this to.\u201d",

    "summary": "It\u2019s time to fall back again.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s time to fall back again.",
      "The clock will strike 1 a.m. twice Sunday morning as daylight saving time once again comes to an end.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about daylight saving time and why the U.S. changes clocks twice a year.",
      "When does daylight saving time end?",
      "Daylight saving time began March 10 and ends Nov. 3.",
      "Unlike in the spring, when we lose an hour and the clocks skip the 2 o\u2019clock hour entirely, we will gain an extra hour Sunday, with clocks jumping from 1:59 a.m. back to 1 a.m.",
      "The sun will also start setting earlier across the U.S. as the temperatures continue to cool down and we head into the late fall and winter months.",
      "Why is this happening?",
      "The practice, established by the Standard Time Act in 1918, according to the U.S. Astronomical Applications Department, is an effort to extend the daylight hours we have in the summertime by pushing off sunset an extra hour.",
      "Daylight saving time, a contested idea after it was first passed, was quickly repealed in 1919, becoming a local matter. It was re-enacted during the early days of World War II and was observed from 1942-1945, according to the department.",
      "After the war, the implementation of daylight saving time varied from state to state until the Uniform Time Act passed in 1966, which standardized the dates of daylight saving time but allowed for local exemptions if states or localities did not want to participate.",
      "According to the department, the standardized start and end dates have been changed throughout the years, but since 2007, daylight saving time has started on the second Sunday in March and ended on the first Sunday in November.",
      "How long does standard time last?",
      "Standard time across the U.S. will remain, as will earlier sunsets and darker evenings, until the spring rolls around and daylight saving time starts once again.",
      "In 2025, daylight saving time starts on Sunday, March 9, and ends on  Sunday, Nov. 2, when it\u2019s time to repeat the process.",
      "Are there any states that don\u2019t observe?",
      "Yes, Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe daylight saving time and therefore do not change their clocks twice a year, according to the Astronomical Applications Department.",
      "Is the U.S. the only country that does this?",
      "No, most countries observe some version of \u201csummer time,\u201d according to the department. In the Northern Hemisphere, most of the countries that observe daylight saving time are in Europe and North America.",
      "Though other countries observe a version of daylight saving time, not all do so on the same schedule as the U.S.",
      "There are also Southern Hemisphere countries that observe some version of daylight saving time, but below the equator, the seasons are swapped, so the start and end date of their \u201csummer time\u201d are reversed from ours, according to the department.",
      "According to the Pew Research Center, only about a third of all countries observe daylight saving time. At one point, about half of all countries observed the practice but no longer do.",
      "What efforts have been made to end the practice?",
      "In March 2022, the U.S. Senate passed the Sunshine Protection Act, which would make daylight saving time permanent year-round and usher out the era of changing our clocks.",
      "Under the bill, Hawaii and most of Arizona would continue to observe year-round standard time.",
      "But the bill has since stalled in the House of Representatives, meaning the U.S. will continue to observe the time change until it is passed in that chamber and then signed by the sitting president.",
      "Almost all states have considered legislation to stay on standard or daylight saving time, and 20 states have passed bills or resolutions to implement year-round daylight saving time in the last six years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But, because federal law currently does not allow for year-round daylight saving time, the states would have to wait for Congress to pass the bill in order to make the change.",
      "What do health experts say?",
      "Some studies suggest that using daylight saving time year-round could reduce the number of traffic accidents and the amount of crime.",
      "But a number of experts aren\u2019t in favor of permanent daylight saving time. That\u2019s because the sun should reach the highest point in the sky at noon, according to sleep experts, which is known as solar time.",
      "During standard time, people in the central time zone in the U.S. are aligned perfectly with solar time, but during daylight saving time, they are pushed further away from that clock.",
      "The more mismatch with solar time, the higher the risk of health problems, Dr. Karin Johnson, a neurology professor at UMass Chan Medical School-Baystate who is on the board of Save Standard Time, a nonprofit that advocates for permanent standard time, told NBC News in 2022.",
      "Sleep experts prefer the back-and-forth of the clocks to permanent daylight saving time. When people wake up in darkness, hormones like cortisol might be higher, which might make people feel sleepier, Dr. Kin Yuen, a sleep medicine specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, and a fellow at the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, said in 2022.",
      "Then, because the sun is out later, people might go to sleep later during daylight saving time, which can delay the body\u2019s production of melatonin.",
      "Plus, a study from June 2022 found that people whose clock times weren\u2019t closely aligned with the sun had 22% higher road fatality rates than those living within 30 minutes of solar time."

    "title": "Some people will need an extra Covid vaccine in the spring",
    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 12:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "How durable are the mRNA Covid vaccines? Does the protection last as long as other vaccines? Experts the vaccines are performing as expected.",
    "story": [
      "In October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that high-risk adults get a second updated Covid vaccine to bolster their protection against the virus.",
      "The agency now recommends that people ages 65 and up and those with weakened immune systems get a second dose of the 2024-25 vaccine six months after their first dose.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time the agency has advised or allowed for an additional dose for at-risk groups several months after the first. In the spring of 2022, officials authorized a second booster dose after the initial fall rollout. The same pattern followed in the spring of 2023 and the spring of 2024.",
      "No other vaccines are given at such a high frequency, but experts say there\u2019s no reason to believe that the vaccines \u2014 and in particular, the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna \u2014 aren\u2019t effective.",
      "Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s vaccines were the first to use mRNA technology to induce immunity to a virus, an approach that proved critical in the early days of the pandemic because mRNA vaccines can be developed much faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "Despite the CDC recommending an additional shot, there\u2019s no evidence that the mRNA vaccines aren\u2019t working as expected, said Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunology at the Yale School of Medicine.",
      "Rather, Iwasaki said, there may be something unique to this virus that is preventing people\u2019s bodies from maintaining high levels of immunity.",
      "A recent study from researchers at Emory University found that so-called hybrid immunity \u2014 when a person has been both vaccinated and infected with the coronavirus at some point \u2014 failed to significantly establish certain long-lasting cells that secrete antibodies. That wasn\u2019t the case for people who had been vaccinated against the flu and tetanus, suggesting, Iwasaki said, that something different is happening with the virus.",
      "\u201cYou would think that kind of hybrid immunity is going to be the most rigorous, and yet they did not see increases in these long-lived plasma cell numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and the former White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said there is some uncertainty about the durability of the mRNA vaccines compared to older vaccines technologies.",
      "\u201cMaybe it is a little less durable,\u201d Jha said. \u201cI would say we don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The bigger issue, Jha said, is how rapidly the virus mutates, as well as its year-round presence.",
      "\u201cThe problem here in my mind is not so much with the vaccine but much more with the virus,\u201d he said, adding that he supports the updated guidance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019ve actually been recommending to my own parents and it\u2019s what I have said publicly,\u201d he said.",
      "The guidelines come amid concerns that waning vaccine immunity, particularly in older adults, may leave them more vulnerable to severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\u201cTopping off your vaccine-induced immunity every six to 12 months is not a bad idea,\u201d said E. John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. The vaccine bolsters antibody levels, which are the first line of defense against the virus, he added.",
      "\u201cThat makes it easier for the rest of your immune system to clean up and prevent that little bit of infection-causing disease,\u201d Wherry said.",
      "A rapidly changing virus",
      "\u201cWe look at our flu vaccine strains every year and try to match them up as best we can,\u201d said Dr. Anna Durbin, an infectious disease physician and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s changing even faster with Covid \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s constantly mutating to get the advantage.\u201d",
      "One reason there aren\u2019t frequent boosters for a virus like measles is because it doesn\u2019t change as rapidly as the coronavirus.",
      "\u201cA measles virus that you encounter today is very similar to a measles virus that you might have encountered five years ago or 10 years ago,\u201d Jha said.",
      "In a perfect world, the Covid vaccines would be able to be updated much faster to match the strains in circulation.",
      "\u201cBy the time we pick which strain of Covid we\u2019re going to switch the vaccine to, and by the time that vaccine is ready and rolled out, the virus has already mutated some,\u201d Durkin said. \u201cSo the thought really is, can we boost immunity that may not be a perfect match to the strain circulating?\u201d",
      "If that immunity is boosted with another dose of the vaccine, we\u2019ll be able to better protect those high-risk people, she said.",
      "Jha doesn\u2019t expect the twice yearly vaccine to become a universal recommendation for all age groups, as the immune system of a 30-year-old is far more robust than that of an 80-year-old.",
      "\u201cUnless the virus gets more virulent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich I don\u2019t really think is going to happen.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Two Ohio police officers were charged with reckless homicide in the death of a Black man who pleaded \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d during a police encounter, authorities announced Saturday.",
      "Canton officers Camden Burch and Beau Schoenegge have been charged with reckless homicide in the April 18 death of Frank E. Tyson during a confrontation with police, Stark County Prosecuting Attorney Kyle L. Stone announced at a news conference Saturday.",
      "Burch and Schoenegge, both 24, were booked into jail Friday and remained in custody Saturday, NBC affiliate WKYC of Cleveland reported, citing cited inmate records.",
      "Stone said he presented a grand jury with the results of an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation probe into Tyson\u2019s death, which the agency completed in August. The grand jury approved the charges as part of an indictment.",
      "The reckless homicide charge, a third-degree felony, could carry a three-year sentence and a $10,000 fine for each defendant, if convicted, Stone said.",
      "Representatives for state and local police organizations did not immediately respond to efforts seeking to reach the officers or their legal counsel for comment.",
      "In a statement to the Canton Repository, Craig M. Riley, president of Fraternal Order of Police Ohio Labor Council Gold Unit, accused prosecutors of playing politics with the case just a few days from Tuesday\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cTrue progress,\u201d he said, \u201ccomes from collaboration, investment, and open communication \u2014 not from using our officers as well-timed scapegoats to score political points.\u201d",
      "The union represents Canton police supervisors, according to the Repository.",
      "The Canton Police Department released Schoenegge\u2019s body camera footage of the encounter a week later. The officers had responded to a vehicle crash with a downed utility pole, and a witness directed them down the road at an AMVETS lodge, where they made contact with Tyson, police said.",
      "In the video, Tyson is seen knocking over a barstool, shouting a request to call the sheriff, and saying, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me,\u201d as the officers try to get him into custody. He\u2019s taken to the ground and handcuffed before one officer then appears to put a knee on Tyson\u2019s upper body for roughly 30 seconds.",
      "Tyson says multiple times, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d",
      "An officer tells him to cooperate and calm down. Tyson says again, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d before adding, \u201cYou\u2019re on my neck.\u201d",
      "After the officer lifts his knee, Tyson is left without aid and appears motionless for roughly five minutes, according to the video. An officer asks if Tyson has calmed down and whether he\u2019s breathing, at which point his pulse is checked and officers perform chest compressions.",
      "Tyson was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.",
      "The preliminary autopsy report lists causes of death as cardiopulmonary arrest in association with physical altercation and prone restraint, as well as acute intoxication by cocaine and ethanol.",
      "Schoenegge and Burch, both of whom joined the department in 2022 and are assigned to the traffic bureau, were placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation.",
      "The death echoed the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in the spring of 2020 when an officer pressed a knee to Floyd\u2019s neck as he repeated, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d",
      "Before that, Eric Garner died after a July 17, 2014, confrontation with New York City police officers who stopped him to investigate the possible sale of loose, untaxed cigarettes on the street. He also pleaded \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as an officer held him in a chokehold.",
      "Bobby DiCello, an attorney for Tyson\u2019s family, said at a news conference after Stone addressed the news media that the charges mark progress toward justice.",
      "\u201cThe prosecutor for Stark County acted with courage to bring charges to the grand jury,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is how justice works \u2014 through acts of courage.\u201d",
      "John Tyson, brother of the victim, characterized the day\u2019s news as an incremental move forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the win we were looking for, but we will take this small win and build upon it,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Jason Kelce appeared to run into some trouble with a college football fan while he was in Happy Valley on Saturday for the Penn State-Ohio State game.",
      "Videos shared on social media and verified by NBC News show Kelce walking outside Penn State\u2019s Beaver Stadium holding a case of beer while he is surrounded by fans.",
      "In the background, a man can be heard shouting at Kelce and then using a homophobic slur to describe his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in reference to Travis Kelce\u2019s relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift.",
      "In the videos, Kelce then appears to turn around, grab the man\u2019s phone, smash it to the ground, pick it up again and walk away.",
      "Another angle appears to show the man chasing after Kelce and asking for his phone back. In this video, Kelce appears to repeat the slur back to the person.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the man whose phone was smashed was the same man who shouted the slur. It was also not clear whether the man was a student at Penn State or Ohio State or if he was just visiting for the game.",
      "ESPN, which is representing Kelce in this matter, declined to comment. Penn State did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the man is a student there.",
      "Kelce retired from the Philadelphia Eagles at the end of last season and has been appearing as a commentator for ESPN. He was at the game Saturday with the network's \"College GameDay\" and participated in a kicking challenge against a Penn State student for the program.",
      "Kelce\u2019s brother, Travis Kelce, and Swift have been in a relationship since last summer, when Travis Kelce showed up to the \u201cEras Tour\u201d in Kansas City with a friendship bracelet and a dream.",
      "Since then, the couple has frequently been seen supporting each other\u2019s careers, with Swift cheering on the Chiefs at home games and Travis Kelce making appearances at \u201cEras Tour\u201d shows around the globe.",
      "Jason Kelce and Swift have also become close over the course of her relationship with his brother, hanging out in the box above Arrowhead Stadium during Chiefs games. Kelce and his wife, Kylie, took two of their three daughters to see Swift\u2019s \u201cEras Tour\u201d in Miami last month."
